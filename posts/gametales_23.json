        "text": "So, I've sort of been playing Champions Online on and off since it came out, even more when it became F2P. But I never really got involved in the roleplay groups in the game, til someone said they were interested in doing a villain-focused session.\n\nSo I pulled out my long-not-been-played-with supervillainess, The Eternal Sovereign (Necromancer lady. Think Maleficent if less hellfire and more minions, and more reds than blues in her colour schema), and hung out in that player's penthouse with other would-be villains, as he weaved a tale, which I will relay to you now.\nBear in mind the following all occurs with us taking turns hanging around someone's bed in their Penthouse hideout.\n\n---\n\nThe Sovereign received a message from an informant saying that a cargo ship was carrying a magical payload, off the coast of Rio, and any who'd be interested should head over to a certain building in New York, to meet likeminded individuals who wanted to rob it for cash or magic.\n\nSo, the Sovereign attended the meeting, resplendent in glory, and accompanied by two shadow-men, sentient shadows who lurked by her feet, prepared to slaughter any who dare strike at their creator.\n\nA teenage boy chatted with her, a martial artist who was clown-like in costume named Punchline, who was probing as to why 'Spooky' was here.\n\n\"I am here as this... payload... May be precisely what I require for my goals.\" the Sovereign stated, haughty and aloof.\n\n\"And what goals are that, eh?\" the comedy hero questioned.\n\n\"They are my goals, and lets leave it at that. Unless you want me to ask you what you intend to do with the money you'll be getting from this.. ah... job?\"\n\n\"That's easy,\" he shrugged, \"I'm going to get myself a bi*iiig* swimming pool made in the Comedy Club, fill it with Slappers who love my Stick, get it?\"\n\nThe Sovereign groaned and pinched the bridge of her nose.\n\n\"Seriously. You want to use what might very well be the Eyes of Gorbash for all we know... To fund your hedonistic urges?\"\n\n\"Sure!\"\n\n\"I can see it will be 'fun', in a certain way, working with you, Mister...\"\n\n\"Punchline, toots. Call me Punchline!\"\n\n\"You may address me as the Eternal Sovereign. Call me 'toots' and... I will probably not do anything. For now. Be afraid if you die at some point though.\"\n\n\"Sure thing, toots!\"\n\nThe Sovereign rubbed her temples.\n---\n\nOther villains came in. A cyborg hacker named Jackboii, an armour plated power armour wearer named Epsilon, and a little girl named Princess Snuggles.\n\nSnuggles was a rat in a pink tutu. Nobody questioned it. We had all seen stranger.\n\nThe job was simple. Get in, grab the goods, get out, try not to make too much chaos or the heroes would arrive on scene.\n\nEpsilon was going to get us into the belly of the ship via stealth sub, from which he'd cut our way into the ship from underneath, getting us into the lower decks, in an area unlikely to be used.\nSnuggles would then scout ahead, whilst Jackboii was on hand to hack past any security systems on the way.\n\nPunchline was to stay on the submarine and get ready to bail at the end.\n\nThe Sovereign's role?\n\n\"Muscle. You can conjure spirits, right? If the going gets tough, you can add numbers to our forces whilst Epsilon slaps a teleporter on the container to the client.\"\n\n\"Yes, that can be done. I trust nobody minds if I take my payment in access to the cargo, rather than the money?\"\n\nEpsilon shrugged. \n\n\"Boss man didn't say we can't take some. All he said is he needs just one piece of it and we get paid the same.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\"\n\n--\n\nThe first thing about a plan is that it never works out quite as planned.\n\nTurns out, a laser that can maybe hit through Armadillo and give that supervillain a bruise actually makes a loud noise when shearing through solid steel to allow a passage between our submarine and their ship. \n\nIt's also important to know that the stealth technology of a D-list supervillain like Epsilon actually isn't that great against a US Government ship carrying dangerous goods.\n\nAlarms buzzed through the corridors as spectres were rapidly summoned to corral the crew into their quarters.\n\n\"You think you can hold them, Spooky?\" asked Snuggles, whiskers twitching in the air.\n\nThe Sovereign shrugged.\n\n\"The dead do not obey, so much as listen and maybe decide it's better not to disobey if they know what's best for them. There's always a risk.\"\n\nSnuggles nodded solemly, and carried on, leading Jackboii to the ship manifest, the Sovereign following slowly, maintaining her control on her spirits.\n\nPunchline maintained communication, hitting on Princess Snuggles.\n\nA few of the crew had begun to fight the spirits, and the Sovereign felt them draw from her reserves until Upsilon hung back to instill direct fear with laser-blasting walls and stuff.\n\nSnuggles eventually, after getting distracted by Punchline referring to an 'incident in Vermont' he knew about, lead Jackboii to the computer, and they found out which container the goods were in.\n\nA287. Port side. Blue. Labelled 'Fish Byproducts'.\n\nAnd so we went over there, surprisingly with no difficulty. Jackboii did computer stuff.\n\nPunchline came on the comm, and said that he was detecting multiple flight signatures coming our way, looked like heroes, maybe Thundrax based on the mullet his sensors were picking up somehow (we had a moment here out of character, where basically it was 'wait, sensors that can detect mullets?' 'Sure, why not? You have a talking rat princess and a necromancer queen working with a decker and a Iron Man, coordinated by the Joker if he dressed like Batman. Why is mullet-sensors what knocks your disbelief, Sov?' '... It just... Okay, fair point.')\n\nWe opened the cargo container (it was my turn, so 'magic doesn't directly work on iron, but it doesn't have to. I am a sorceress, after all. FIREBALL THAT GODDAMN IRON.'), and found a small pile of...\n\nFish entrails.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait.\n\nThese are octopi eyes.\n\nThey're not...\n\nEpsilon's player confirmed my suspicion.\n\nQilopthean entity parts. Basically, mini-Cthultu meats.\n\n\"This... This is extremely valuable, isn't it?\" asked Snuggles.\n\n\"Eh, maybe, if it's real. Probably more dangerous than valuable. Did anybody think to bring plastic bags or something?\"\n\nThe Sovereign pulled out a pouch, and scooped up a chunk of the wriggling flesh.\n\n\"Well, that's my pay. I only brought one bag though, so...\"\n\nAnd then the ship shook.\n\nEveryone's sent scattering, Snuggles is going beserk, Punchline's cursing, Jackboii's being stoic and silent, Epsilon's keeping order with the crew, his jetboots compensating for being knocked around, and the Sovereign...\n\n\nThe Sovereign releases all control over the spirits for an instant in her panic, causing them to vanish.\n\nThe roar of rioting crewmembers is only outmatched by the roar of a superhero, eyes aglow, floating from above onto the ship deck.\n\n\"Who's this?\" the Sovereign whispers to Jackboii.\n\n\"Alexandrian. Superman expy ooc.\"\n\nWe all simply flee, each deciding to just leg it.\n\nIn retrospect, we were kind of shitty at being villains, buggering off the moment the Superman-wannabe came up.\n\nEpsilon guided us to the sub, and Punchline floored it out of there.\n\nAll we had gotten out of it was the Sovereign's scoop of monster goop.\n\nIt took a long debate afterwards, but \"fine, I'll split the intestine bits, but dibs on the eyes and tentacles. Dammit.\".\n\nAnd that is the story of how a bunch of supervillains got on a ship, got away with part of what they wanted, and decided to not bother with the hassle of fighting a superhero.\n\nI haven't RP'd since in CO, never have the time, but that vaguely remembered story is one I always have warm feelings about.\n",

        "author": "Giga571",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4izf3e/borderlands_2_a_fluke_or_an_instinctual_win/",
        "text": "Hey. This is my first post anywhere on Reddit, so I figure I'll make it a big one. This is a story of how I beat a friend of mine in PvP.\n\nTo start off, I should probably make sure you're familiar with the mechanics of the game. Borderlands 2 is a first person shooter, with an emphasis on randomized loot. There are six types of guns - pistols, relatively weak but high-ammo guns that generally fire one bullet per pull of the trigger, submachine guns, similar to pistols but firing automatically as long as you hold the trigger down, shotguns, low-ammo but high-power close range beasts, assault rifles, meant to be similar to submachine guns with more power and less ammo, sniper rifles, the logical extreme high-power low-ammo guns which are also highly accurate, meant to be used at long range, and rocket launchers, the lowest ammo, highest damage guns, with projectiles that deal splash damage. All pretty standard stuff. There are also shields, which give the user a buffer before they start taking permanent health damage, which regenerates if you manage to not take damage long enough.\n\nSecondly, there is the class system. I'm only going to focus on the two classes me and my friend were using. He was the Assassin, Zero, who has the ability to turn invisible and project a decoy of himself to confuse attackers. While invisible, he is not invincible, but his melee attack becomes almost seven times more powerful. Meanwhile, I was the Gunzerker, Salvador. My ability is to, at any time, provided I haven't just finished using the ability, buff my health back up to full and use two guns, of any type, at the same time. My preferred playstyle is ultra-conservative; I like making sure I'll never run out of ammo, and that I'll always have regenerating health. My friend's playstyle is to risk everything on a single strike, not caring about his health or ammo.\n\nFinally, there is the elemental system. Invented as a way to give your enemies different weaknesses, there are five main elements. Explosives technically aren't counted as an element, but I'm putting them here anyways. All rocket launchers are explosive element, and other guns can be explosive element too, at the cost of their bullets flying through the air at a slower pace. There is the Shock element, which deals excessive damage to shields over a period of time, the Corrosive element, which deals more damage to things of a mechanical nature and has damage over time, the Fire element, which deals more damage to beings of flesh and bone and again has damage over time, and Slag, which increases the damage of all non-Slag weapons on anything inflicted with it.\n\nThis battle happened years ago, so I'm a little fuzzy on some of the details, but for some reason, I challenged my friend to a PvP match. The environment is key to this fight - we were in the main street of Lynchwood. We had taken out all of the NPCs, leaving us with a bare playing field. Lynchwood is a ghost town, of sorts, there are [buildings and stairwells](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/borderlands/images/7/72/Borderlands_2_Playable_World_Map_made_by_k1ll1ng5pr33.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130201073906). I punched my friend, as is the custom for starting PvP fights, he punched me back to agree to the fight, and I ended up standing on the bottom level, with a set of stairs to both the east and west, and a building to the north of each one. Just to the left of the M in Main Street on the map I linked - those squished rectangles are the stairs, and the shapes just above are the buildings. Of course, since I'd walked there after the match was decided, but before it actually started, I had an idea of where my friend was going to come from - the stairs to the east. In the time before the match started, he hid behind the building just to the north of there.\n\nI had been playing this game with my friend all up to this point. We were familiar with eachother's playstyles - I held onto a piece of equipment that let us both regenerate all types of ammo but rockets, and I tended to only ever use elemental sniper rifles. My friend scoffed at this - when you Gunzerk, you regenerate ammo anyways, and the class is built for weapon types that use up a lot of ammo. I tend to hate it when I miss, however, so I ignored all of this.\n\nSo the match starts. I'm watching the area where my friend hid very carefully. I wasn't expecting him to take the long way around, and attack me from behind - he's far too impatient for that. And he didn't. I noticed a disturbance in the air - he must've cloaked! - and I immediately gunzerked and unloaded both of my sniper rifles on him as fast as I could. One Slag, the other Fire. The match was over in an instant, and I was the victor. Afterward, my friend was shocked, yet still quite vocal over our voice chat, asking excitedly how I'd managed to see him coming while he was cloaked. At the time, I didn't have an answer for him. It had happened too fast for me to register it. But I was still the winner - and with a strategy that wouldn't have worked with any other set of guns, or any other class. We both knew this, and we shared a laugh about it. It's a fond memory of mine to this day.",

        "text": "A couple of months ago when I was still new to GO (not new to CS however), I wasn't at a high enough level to play competitive play, which meant I had to sit through hours of casual play. I don't mind it as much as most people do, but I suppose you either dread playing casual or love it. For anyone who doesn't play GO, it's more of the \"anything goes\" gamemode, with up to 10 people on each team and the ability to drop in and out of games, features that competitive doesn't have.\n\nI load up the game, queue into a casual server on Dust 2, and join team terrorist. I start talking with some people on the server about random things when I notice one of my teammates, \"The Joker\", is slurring his words together and generally just talking about nonsense. I say to him, \"Hey, Joker, are you under the influence?\" and he quickly responds with \"Dude I'm drunk as **FUCK**\" in sort of a southern accent combined with the stereotypical stoner voice, followed with hysterical, crazed laughter. This guy was beyond wasted, he said he had about 20+ beers and apparently was smoking crack too; I already love this guy.\n\nThe Joker becomes an instant hit amongst the entire server, and eventually becomes our team captain. Everyone on our team was asking him what to do, and he would give us callouts that didn't even exist on Dust 2 like \"B doors\" and \"apartments\", all while calling us his \"clowns\" . He's doing the worst on our entire team and doesn't have very much money, but he demands that someone buys him an auto-sniper every round so he can watch mid to plan our attacks. You'd think with a drunk, high, insane man leading the team we'd be losing but we were winning by a landslide\n\nSome guy suggested that we all recommend The Joker as a great leader and such and literally everyone on the 20 person server recommends him. Even though he yelled at us in a drunken fit of rage when we did something against his plans, sat at the bottom of our leaderboards, and demanded someone buy him a $5000 weapon every round, he still lead our team to victory every time. Almost everyone on the server sent him friend requests, and he accepted all of them. \n\nEventually he went afk for a VERY long time, and I got off before he came back. The next morning I messaged him on steam asking him where he went and this guy literally passed out on his keyboard. Nowadays I play with him whenever I get the chance, every game is a blast when you have an alcoholic maniac telling you to go to places on the map that don't exist.",

AlI I wanted to do was stop.\n\n\nI also really wanted to play some DnD.\n\n\nI reached out to all my friends on Facebook to come play with me at a local cafe. I say here for hours and no one came. The only person that responded to my post was my mother who currently lives on the west coast (I am east coast). I was about to pack up and leave to go dive into some PS3 Minecraft and 7-11 \"I want to die\" pizza. Then some rando Lady and her dog noticed my dice and struck up a conversation.\n\n\nShe wanted to play. \n\n\nMe: ok\n\n\nShe picks a elf wizard and asks if I'm playing 3.5e. Um I dunno. This is literally the second time I've played and first time GMing. As I said before I'm in Fuck It Mode, so screw the rules I have depression and I feel like jumping into oncoming traffic. She's okay with that tho and just plays along with my simplistic ruleset. As she is making a character another rando shows up. He is very handsome and WAY out of my league. Triggering plenty of internalized self hate.\n\nHe's talking with a buddy, probably a boyfriend. He overheard rando lady and peers over my way and asks if that's DnD. He is talking to me so immediate mental relief washes over me and I say \"do you want to play?\".\n\n\nHim: Fuck yes\n\n\nMe: ok\n\n\nHe is a dragonborn fighter. Okay that's dope. My mood is weird at this point I mean Outwardly I'm pleasant enough and inwardly I still want to fade away into nothingness but these people are ruining that inward stuff and making me feel good. \n\nRando guy smiles back at me. THE FUCK!? I've been smiling and staring at him for a full fucking minute.\n\nMe: I have to go to the bathroom brb\n\n\nThem: okay we are almost done so let's start after you get back.\n\nI am in this bathroom writing this post because writing soothes my anxiety attacks. I don't really know what to do and I hope I don't fuck this up. \n\nWill update you guys later if things go smoothly with my shitty attempt at being a GM.",

        "text": "I am DMing a low-level campaign which concerns the scandals of an Elven Prince from a nearby settlement. The plothooks involves the party meeting several local victims of the Prince's selfishness and greed, one of whom is a young human woman raising her half-elf son all by herself. So let it be noted that before the first session, I'd already established in my plans that there is a young woman who was once romantically involved with an Elven Noble, this woman is very attractive (an Elven Noble would stoop no lower than the tallest branch!), and she is single. You can probably guess what follows...\n\nThe plothook springs (quite literally) into action when the child is kidnapped by a giant frog that stumbled upon the village. Cries of a distraught mother propel the party of 5 towards the forest where the beast lies in wait beneath murky swamp waters. They do battle with their slimy foe and return victorious with the boy resting in the Cleric's arms. The mother is ever so grateful but has little to offer as a reward, so instead invites them for dinner that evening.\n\nThe party agree, and promptly discard the thought before it fully settles in their mind as memory. Five hours of cave exploring later, the arrangement is nothing but a shadow of an echo of a whisper of a long forgotten legend. When they return from their Kobold genocide, they set to work on their side-project: militarising the peasant village for no good reason (typical PCs amirite?). They each have important roles to play: crafting armour and arms; training their microarmy to the best of their ability; playing fetch with a stray dog; and other such vital tasks.\n\nThe Eladrin Swordmage, however, decides they need more troops, and the best way to do this is by taking a census (regardless of the setting sun). It's a good use of his skills though - he comes from a very wealthy family of magical item merchants in the Feywild and is used to taking inventory, even if it's of people this time. However, despite the low population, it takes a long time after all the chitter chatter and chasing he endures, and around 10 o'clock he reaches the house of someone he recognises. I shouldn't need state who.\n\nAt this point I realised what I had done. I had no intention of souring my campaign with fetishistic in-game interspecies romance subplots - it was the last thing I wanted, it even ranks below a TPK! But my hand was forced. The dice had been been rolled. It was too late. It was always too late.\n\nNo DM could have predicted the events that led to this moment, to a noble Eladrin standing on the doorstep of his admirer late at night, a candlelit banquet sat prepared behind her in anticipation. No DM could have prevented the dazzling moonlight dancing off her pearly teeth as a confused bemused amused smile spread across her face. No DM could have prepared for her silky red hair fluttering gently in the cool summer evening breeze, flowing over her body, accentuating the curve of her breast. No DM could ever precondemn the glow of his magnificent sword reflecting sharply in the wide emerald eyes that betrayed her insatiable lust for glimmering blonde hair wound tightly around her wrist as they lay under cotton sheets panting, speckled with bite marks and each other's perspiration. No DM could preadmonish the acts that would play out on those steps up to the warmly illuminated doorway silhouetted by a venereal figure of Aphroditic grace, or those leading to the carefully furnished bedroom soon to be torn asunder by wild love unleashed with the immense passion of two forbidden lovers entangled in each other's arms, or those passing to the next room where a young boy lay struck by horror and wide-eyed until dawn breaks.\n\nI'm so sorry.",

The loot the gained from doing this contained a whole bunch of feather tokens and after finding out what each one did the players were convinced that they wanted a naval campaign.\n\nAfter doing a couple of odd jobs around the town,  they used one of their feather token to magically manifest a ship, shaped like a swan, now this isnt very scary or threatening and the characters didn't think so either, so after some very good rolls they managed to convince a local shipwright to take it off there hands for a small warship (only has a crew of around 20).\n\nAnd so our heroes head off to the open seas, they quickly spot a small merchant vessel not much smaller than theirs, the bard finds a small eyeglass to allow him to see who crews this ship, it is crewed by around 20 blue lizardmen, the bard relays the information as well as throwing in a little background about lizardmen, he tells the crew that almost all lizardmen are slavers, this convinces the chaotic good warforged fighter to take these evil men out.\n\nNow is a good time to say that their ship has one weapon, a large ass black powder cannon mounted at the front of the ship.\n\nas they approach the lizardmen vessel the decide that being sneaky would be the best idea and they talk to the lizardmen captain about his wares, he doesn't actually say he has slaves on board but the party are still convinced they do, its only when the lizardman accidentally lets loose that he might have a few knocking about below decks that the party attack. \nFrom very close range the party fire there large ass cannon at the deck below the lizardman captain, he is never seen again, ship combat starts taking place and the party start picking off the lizardmen on the ship, most of the enemies start to get into rowboats in order to board the players ship, its now that the bard decides to try and find something to drop on them, something heavy, he states that he wants to go below decks and find a table (its was the first heavy thing to come to mind) he rolls stupidly low and as the dick bag GM i am i state that in every room he goes into he cannot find a single table on the ship he then goes above decks again to hold off the attackers while commanding the rest of the crew to find something heavy, like tables, the crew rolled stupidly low and couldn't find a single table, thats when a plucky midshipman runs up to the bard with a cannonball in hand as asks whether this is heavy enough. \nThe player then turns to me and OoC says \"i completely forgot about cannonballs being on this ship\" ",

Aust's player has rolled a new character to give the party a tank and as such Aust spends his time meditating in his family crypt. Sora returns from taking care of funerary arrangements for a member of her old gang, a half-orc druid named Dreez that had been attempting to buy some dogs from a dogfighting ring when he was seemingly beaten to death. Graz, brother of Dreez, called Sora back when her player wasn't there for the session. Kieran was the next to arrive, a small but important diplomatic party from neighboring Camelyn in tow. The party recognized these persons as the Lord Commander and the Royal Sommelier (and Spymaster) of Camelyn. The party's functional commander, David Brightwall, took the Lord Commander in to see the manifesting twin longswords of Aust's grandfather's spirit, now serving as a tireless weapon master willing to train any that enter the manor's ballroom.\n\nThe party eats lunch lovingly brought to them by the manor's ghost butler and as they finish a small force approaches the manor by road. The party recognizes the soldiers as those of Duskwood, the nation the manor is in, headed by three persons known to Kieran. The Supreme Legate of the Legions, a 6'7\" brick shithouse of a human; the Imperial Falconer, very much the opposite and continually being landed on by birds; and Geth, the youngest son of the aristocrat that Kieran had disgraced (and the younger brother of Kieran's lover). The legion troops move to tents that have been erected on the grounds and the diplomatic party heads inside to get to the business that needs done. Brightwall tells the party that they're not welcome in the meeting but they're more than welcome to listen in from the servant's passage and that they'll likely have company there. \n\nCarric decides he'll just listen at the door and overhears snippets of what is discussed. Camelyn will surrender to Duskwood in its failed rebellion. Duskwood continues to recognize Camelyn's right to soveriegnty. Armies will remain standing awaiting the true threat. Scrolls are signed and those in the meeting head out, congratulating the party on stopping the war. Spymasters head to a hastily furnished lounge joined by Kieran. Geth and Sora make for the dining room. Carric sneaks after Aust who leaves the meeting and heads back for the crypt, watches him for a while, then decides he hasn't burned anything down recently and goes through the gate opening (gate is long gone) in the back side of the grounds and lights one of the abandoned staff homes on fire. The party sleeps and wakes. \n\nGeth's route to breakfast takes him past the ballroom where he sees the Legate sparring with Grandfather to the point where the spectral weapon master surrenders. The Legate tells Geth he's being assigned to Brightwall's command and will be working with the party. Others make a more direct route to the dining room for breakfast before being summoned to the meeting room. Brightwall tells them that they'll be going to Duskwood to participate in a tournament to celebrate the victory over Camelyn, that the war was never going to happen, and that this is part of something bigger than him. Carric has a crisis of allegiance because he was conscripted and does this mean he's free? He's certainly free to go back to the army if he wants, he joined to escape the noose, not because the war was coming. Still, he pledges his life to whatever cause Brightwall has for him. The party follows the Legate outside with the Falconer bringing up the rear. A teleportation circle has been prepared and is activated to send the party to Duskwood. The last the party sees as they enter the circle is Brightwall dropping his human form and taking flight as a very large gold dragon.\n\nStepping through the portal they arrive in a small room which lets off into a hallway. The Legate doesn't even break stride as he heads down a hundred feet of hallway to the central hall of the Duskwood College of Mages. The party notices Aust coming through another door along with the caster that had activated the circle for them but doesn't have time to turn and talk because the Legate doesn't slow down. After following the Legate for a little while the party is intercepted by Jamal, another member of Brightwall's company and led down to an inn closer to the coliseum. At this point it finally register's with Carric's player that his old pal David turned into a dragon. Jamal knows and upon arriving at the inn the party notices another familiar person, Dingo, the halfling forger that has been spending army money to keep them provisioned. He's paid for rooms, food, and drink for the party. \n\nThe party settles in then accompanies Jamal to the colliseum where they get a preview of the arenas they'll be fighting in. The first is a small square stone pit where they'll be fighting as champions of camelyn against the champions of duskwood. The second is a longer arena with a row of 10' diameter half-circle metal braziers down either side that the party notices has a number of pit traps. Having seen what they needed to see the party returns to the inn where Kieran plays into the night trying to make some money. At the end of the night Kieran scoops up his tips and has made about 20 gold which Carric attempts to steal from him. I decide to allow it and Carric's player rolls slightly better than Kieran's so I tell him he's managed to nick 5 gold making sure not to risk getting caught by taking too much. Carric's player is unhappy with this, Kieran's player doesn't really care because it's just 5 gold. The night passes and the party is collected by Jamal in the morning and led into the colliseum for their first fight.\n\nMoving through the maze of access tunnels the party is led to an underground area where four robed humans stand facing them. Two others dressed the same stand facing towards a half-orc in bloodstained hide armor carrying a greataxe and a half-elf in a shining breastplate wielding a longsword one-handed opposite an equally shining shield. The party, with a little cajoling, takes their places in front of the four robed humans as they hear their bout being announced. The champions of Camelyn will fight the champions of Duskwood, the champion of the pits and the champion of the arena fight for the honor of Duskwood. With that, the robed humans reach out and raise their arms in unison, sending the party and their opponents up into the arena on pillars of stone. Geth squares off against the champion of the pits, the greataxe wielding half-orc, and holds firm through the reckless onslaught, taking only one solid hit in the fight. Sora transformed into a black bear but had some difficulty making it past the shield of the champion of the arena. Carric used the distraction to get in several solid blows before being bashed off his feed and stabbed. Kieran encouraged the party up to the point where he decided that the shield was certainly not helping things upon which time he caused it to start to glow with heat, burning the half-elf's hand before it was cast aside. With the shield gone the champion of the arena lost his head to Carric's shortsword. The champion of the pits grew accustomed to the taste of the pommel of Geth's rapier, surging through the first attempt to knock him out but dropping simply enough to the second. The party was announced as the victor and presented a prize, a set of enchanted gauntlets. \n\nSpellblade's Gauntlets - Attuned item. Functionally +2 to spell attack modifier and spell save DC made by modifying the base so they won't stack with other prizes awarded in the tournament. Spellblade's Strike - 1 charge, recharges on a long rest, when using your action to cast a spell you may use your bonus action to make an attack with a 1-handed weapon. If the target of the attack was affected by the spell you make the attack with advantage. (I'm making my own magic items and was having trouble thinking of what I wanted these to do. Carric's player's face lit up like a kid at Christmas when he finally remembered what attacking with advantage meant for him.)\n\nThe party was met again by Jamal who led them down to take a rest and then apologized because there was apparently another arena that hadn't been prepared when they were there the night before. When the time for their next fight came the party moved through the corridors once more to one end of a long arena with several 15' walls running lengthwise allowing them vision towards a number of one of the token forces of Camelyn, the Brothers of the Sword, a group that look just like the Sword Prince of Camelyn. The announcer called the fight, the invading forces of Camelyn would be repelled, as in history, by the shifting walls and the glorious forces of the Empire. As the party stepped forward a number of walls shot up, blocking their view of the opposing force. Kieran encouraged each of the party members before telling Geth that he was off to see his sister and slipping out just as the doors to the arena closed behind them (his player had to go to work, other players wanted to keep going). The party moved up to engage as the walls oriented widthwise rose and fell (Walls denoted by 3 colors, d8 for change at 20 initiative losing ties, 1 is no change, 2-4 each have one color, 5-7 have combinations of 2 colors, 8 all change). The fight isn't incredibly hard but towards the end the walls isolated the last hostile and just wouldn't shift (we rolled probably 5 1's in a row between the four of us). Carric climbed Geth, managed to jump to the top of the wall and rolling over brought his cursed shortsword, [Sins](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4b6rbf/dd_5e_when_you_whine_about_what_you_roll_or_not/), to bare as he fell, impaling the final adversary and going unconscious as he landed and his former foe slumped down on top of him. He remembered all the good he'd done, never killing someone that didn't have it coming, as he charged the opposing force. His warhammer dropped several foes with each swing, taking out probably a dozen men before finally being engulfed. Thinking that maybe he'd done enough to rid himself of the curse his final thoughts drifted to the village he'd just left fatherless and he felt the weapon he couldn't rid himself of leave him. Carric's player was disappointed when I didn't want to take Sins and give him an even better weapon without the drawback. Geth was the recipient of the next item.\n\nCufflinks of Turning Bond. Attuned item. Similar to the other item increase base spell attack mod and spell save dc by 2. Bond's Pull - 1 charge, recharges on a long rest. While wielding your bonded weapon you make take the riposte reaction. Your superiority die for this reaction is a d8. (I've flavored this as a reaction which causes the weapon to basically throw itself at the failing attacker before returning to the wielder's hand.)\n\nThe party is asked to fight one more bout as the mercenary company that was to go on in the next bout had to duck out for reasons. Sora transforms into an eagle, flying up to get a vantage on the opposing force, and is summarily shut out of the arena as the silvery dome that separates the combatants from the audience and keeps them from seeing the larger-than life illusions of themselves and their opponents (Both Sora's and Kieran's players were absent from this session, last session ended after the previous fight). This fight is a bit harder, the opponents no longer the in-training opponents they'd previously fought. Following this the party returns to the inn where Carric is stopped from heading straight to bed by the arrival of a man who won't take no for an answer. Geth's father leads them through town to his manor where he tells them to pick one weapon from the armory and it will be delivered to them in the morning. Carric's player is perfectly happy with Sins and a shortsword and looking through the list of weapons in the PHB asks for a net. For whatever reason there is a net for Carric to get but Geth's father insists he chose a weapon. He chooses a shortsword, Geth picks a rapier, and the weapons are sent on their way with a servant while Carric and Geth are invited to stay for dinner. A rather awkward dinner ensues as none of Geth's siblings actually come for dinner and neither does his mother so it's just the three of them. The party then heads back for the inn and wakes to the same servant waiting to give them their weapons. Carric inspects his weapon to find a layer of silver has been appllied.\n\nOnce again Jamal leads Carric and Geth to the entry of their arena where they walk out to see a tall wooden wall in front of them. They hear the roar of fire from beyond it as the announcer tells the tale of the fight. This fight takes us in as glorious forces of the Empire are moving to put down the revolt of the lion queen, having just breached her castle. The wooden wall falls to show gaunt men wearing rags surrounded by dog-like creatures with reddish furn and a black stripe running the length of their backs. The party remembers the locations of the pit traps, carefully avoiding them. The opposing force does not know this and while the dogs make it over the trap simply enough the men don't. The first climbs out of the pit easily enough, the second to go in a pit does so while moving to engage a well-positioned Geth and is stuck in the pit for several rounds. The announcer denounces the treachery of the lion queen as another man and more jackals come out from the door the party entered from and the crowd boos loudly. One of the men lets out a snarl and catches the eye of Geth, putting him to sleep. Another turns his canine muzzle towards Carric hoping for a similar effect but Carric's mother's love and lineage protects him from the sleep-inducing gaze. Carric fights his way to Geth and shakes him awake, the jackals gnaw on Geth's armor making little headway, and the party finishes both jackals and jackalweres. The announcer comes into the arena and announces their victory before leading them out. A few steps into leading them out he falls into one of the pit traps, much to the crowd's amusement, and climbs out and leads the party off in severe pain.\n\nThe party is led down to a holding area with a full bar set up as they'll be here for a while. Some hours later a man comes in completely drenched, claiming to have fallen in, and Carric takes an interest in him. The man takes Carric to the spectator's level and out to see that the arena has been flooded and is currently an 800' diameter lake complete with boats. A short while later the party finds out that this man is their helmsman and he tells them the normal plan for this fight is to come in, circle, then lock in combat with the other ship, pointing to steel rings and hooks on the ends of the crossmembers sitting on the ship's useless masts. Carric asks him to circle at 100' and not engage, the helmsman has no problem with this, and the oarsmen belowdeck push off the wall and begin to move towards the far end. Carric climbs a mast up 15' to the first crossmember and as the boats hit 400' apart crossbow bolts start to fill the air from the five dwarves on the other boat. Carric climbs down and as the boats reach the 100' mark the party's helmsman steers left per party instructions. The opposing helmsman calls a hard right, killing most of his forward momentum but closing some distance by cutting the attempt to circle. The party begin throwing firebolts, burning the beard clear off of one of the dwarves and otherwise shooting off into the distance beyond the opposing ship. The dwarves fire back with their crossbows, missing the party but unfortunately not missing the helmsman. The party's boat begins to turn hard right as the body of the helmsman falls onto the tiller. Carric had been taking cover by the side of the ship and failing to react to the change in course took a crossbow round from the now head-on opponent who in turn took a firebolt and went down. The party chose not to attempt to change their heading so the boats quite quickly closed the distance between them, slamming into one another with the cracking of wood and sending both Carric and two of the dwarves falling to the deck. Geth moved forward to intercept the dwarves while Carric moved back and the dwarves began to board, still firing their crossbows. The boarders pulled out maces and began to do work on Geth who held his own for a while, downing one of them before being knocked out himself. Carric decided that on the boat might not be the best idea and dove off. A crossbow bolt followed him in, causing him to swim under the boat to the other side. During this he noticed that the water only went down about ten feet and the bottom of the arena appeared to be about twenty feet down. Shortly after he saw the unconscious body of Geth sinking below the ship, swimming as fast as he could before getting hold of the armored man and slapping a healing potion down his throat. Geth came to, underwater, out of breath, and wearing metal armor but still managed to swim his way up to the surface. Carric swam back across and made his way to the edge of the deck, popping up to surprise one opponent, killing him outright, as Geth clambored aboard and was summarily knocked back out by the two remaining dwarves. Carric dove back in and was ready with another potion as an unconscious Geth again dropped into the water. The reunion was short-lived as the dwarves above them dove into the water, tackling them through the water and causing everyone to drop the 10 feet to the arena floor. Carric took a bit of a bump to the head falling and was knocked unconscious, Geth got his bearings and began attacking the dwarves before it was announced to them that the fight was over and clerics moved out to heal, revive, and resurrect as they could. Jamal came out and told them that they'd beat the spread and he'd won to which Carric snarkily replied that Jamal owed him two health potions. Jamal let Carric know that he didn't owe him anything. Heading back to the inn they again met a rather happy Dingo who announced that he'd won big as he always bets the draw on water fights. Carric asked him to procure some healing potions and Dingo said he'd see what he could do as the party went to sleep.\n\nMorning rolled around and Carric found two healing potions on his bedside table. He and Geth made their way to the common room of the inn and were met with the arrival of Kieran who had just made his way out the window and down the facade of Geth's father's manor. He was wearing a nice new silver choker.\n\nChoker of Vocal Projection - Attuned item. Same non-stacking +2's as the other items. True Inspiration - 1 charge, recharges on a long rest. You may chose any inspiration die you provide to be rolled with advantage. This choice may be made after the die is rolled but must be made before outcome is determined.\n\nThe party was led to the coliseum to see the arena prepared for the finale. They first came out at the seating level, seeing a pyramid-like structure of four 15' high layers. Looking across they see Aust and a couple individuals they don't recognize. They make their way down to the arena floor and find that movement from the base to the first layer will be by climbing braided ropes and looking at the ropes notices small silver bells on the bottom. They also spot a ladder left by persons that had worked on the structure. Carric pushes Kieran to the wall and attempts to use him to climb the structure. He makes it to Kieran's shoulders before the pair topple over. Jamal returns with the ladder and sets it up on the side of the structure. The party glance about to make sure nobody is watching them and Kieran notices a dwarven figure in the stands that he recognizes as Loremaster Uram of the Duskwood College of Bards. He decides to go pay his respects and has Jamal lead him up where he has a rather boring conversation as Uram seems to be lost deep in thought, as he normally is. He also seems to still be alive, despite his age, which the College of Bards can count as a miracle every day. Carric and Geth find a waist-high stone pedestal with a button on it. Carric inspects the button for traps and finding none attempts to discern the nature of the button. Geth discerns the nature of the button by pushing it, causing it to emit a faint green light which moves into him, healing non-existent wounds, and causing ladders to swing down on hinges from the next level. Carric pushes the button, click. Click. Click. Clickclickclickclickclickclickclick. Satisfied that the button is now simply a button, Carric and Geth move to the ladder where they are met by Kieran who has come back from his chat. The party moves to the second level where they again try the button, this time Carric is the first to hit it, receiving the same green healing light and releasing more ladders. The party climbs to the third level and finds yet another button but decides not to push it as it may just be expending a resource they'd rather have later. They climb down and return to the inn for lunch and then make their way back to the coliseum for the finale.\n\nAs the party enters the arena they can see a number of men on the bottom two layers. The first layer all seem to be humans armed with spears and shields, the second more humans armed with warhammers. Geth begins cutting bells off the bottom of ropes while Carric and Kieran discuss distraction. Carric summons his mage hand and has it move back and forth disturbing two ropes part way down the side and Kieran creates an illusory noise of armor clinking. Geth heads up on the side opposite the noise and begins bashing heads. After he's established himself as here and in the way Carric and Kieran climb up near him. The bulk of the legionaries surround Geth though some do come around the sides of the stone pillars supporting the upper structure to attack Carric and Kieran. At one point Kieran gets shoved off the ledge. Carric sensing that it might be a good idea casts a thunderwave and slams a couple opponents into a pillar, knocking them unconscious before moving around the other direction to try to pick off some of the people engaged with Geth. Kieran climbs back up and drives pure fear into the majority of the remaining legion, causing them to run. Geth reaches out and grabs one with a loud crack as electricity arcs off the man's armor and he falls to the ground. The rest surely enough run the entire way out of the arena leaving only a few remaining. One of them moves to flank Geth and Kieran calls out to him, \"You call yourself a legionnaire? You couldn't even defeat Hannibal.\" The man responds with a meek, \"My grandpa helped defeat Hannibal. I miss you grandpa.\" before dropping to the floor crying. An electified touch later the button's bounty was claimed by Carric who had taken a bit of damage as the opponents that survived his Thunderwave responded with steel. Ladders swung down and Kieran again made noise as Geth climbed the opposite side, moving to a natural chokepoint in the stone walls surrounding the middle holding up the next layer. Kieran climbed up after Geth and Carric climbed part way, tucking himself close to the edge out of view of anyone above. The opponents on this layer were intently waiting on the side Kieran had distracted them towards and didn't do much until Kieran said something inspiring to Geth, upon which point they turned and charge at Geth. These opponents, while not incredibly observant, were skilled with their weapons, swinging heavily at Geth and wearing him down bit by bit. Carric and Kieran took up position on one of the outer paths and began to take out individuals while Geth took the brunt of the force, or would have, had he not magically greased the floor in front of him, covering the entire central area of this layer of the structure. Many of the sergeants spent more time on their backs than on their feet in this layer and Geth took the benefit of the button on this layer. Kieran again made noise on one side and Carric popped his head up to see what awaited them on the next layer: Men adorned with breastplates wielding rapiers, seemingly unphased by the noise. The ladders to this level led to the corners of the 5' walkway and each corner had two men guarding it. The choice was made to have Geth climb one ladder, attempt to take one out, and have Carric do the same on another ladder before moving Kieran up and finishing off the rest. It worked, more or less, though these opponents were trained in a style of fighting similar enough to Geth's that they fought and fought but rarely scored meaningful blows. Carric was chosen to press the button, and ladders dropped down, seemingly trapping him in the + shaped internal area of this level. Trying to get out he did find that the ladders swung freely enough on their hinges and popped up over the edge to see Duskwood's chosen champion.\n\nWearing his traditional robes, the bald wood elf stood, hands in dark gauntlets spiked with jagged obsidian rather than the metal of the war gauntlets he'd worn before. Aust stood prepared for the party to climb to his layer of the pyramid. He didn't respond to their questions, maintaining his usual silence and readiness until the party began their attack. Geth launched into a series of attacks which Aust side-stepped or deflected with his gauntlets. Carric knowing that Aust was not easy to hit let loose a series of arcane pulses point blank. The first two slammed Aust but as the third streaked in Aust reached out and grabbed it, tossing it back into Carric's face, knocking him unconscious. Kieran yelled to Carric that now wasn't a great time to be sleeping on the ground, causing Carric to come to. Aust unleashed a flurry of blows, striking out with his gauntlets and then kicking Geth and Kieran squarely off of the platform, causing them to fall two levels down. Realizing he was probably in a bad place Carric swung down around and the party regrouped to attempt to summit again after a bit of healing from Kieran. They made it up again, finally landing some blows on Aust before Geth was kicked off with the fall completely knocking the wind out of him. Kieran also went over the edge. Carric found his opportunity and slid Sins between Aust's ribs, ending his life and going into a trance in which he had to do his duty as a soldier and kill his brother on the opposite side of the war. Carric came to as the pyramid was melding back down the the ground level, the announcer turning their victory into a victory for the Empire.\n\nThe party reunited with Jamal and were quickly led out a much less labyrinthine series of tunnels and moved quickly to the College of Bards. They moved to a room Kieran knew to be the quarters of Loremaster Uram and were told that this task was theirs, that Jamal's duty was here. Jamal walked away and the party opened the door, revealing a jet black sheen filling the entire doorway. Kieran, being familiar with the capabilities of bards, knew that this was caused by magic preventing outside observation and motioned the party inwards. Inside they saw Loremaster Uram sitting in his chair, the Imperial Falconer to his left and the Legate to his right. The Loremaster asked Kieran how familiar he was with the third verse of the Ballad of the Dragon, the part of the song Kieran had not remembered when he'd performed it a few days ago in the inn. Kieran admitted he wasn't familiar with it and the Loremaster replied that it wasn't sung much by the common people. The third verse deals with the children of the Dragon. \"The first stayed home to rule the land, the second went abroad. The third was crowned the Lion Queen, the fourth became a god.\" And as he finished the Loremaster asked Geth if he was familiar with the organization known as the First Sons. Geth answered in the affirmative and was met with the truth, that they were the second sons. The Loremaster went on to say that troubled times were ahead and a number of prophecies were being fulfilled, he'd just witnessed a Lord of Orleth sent to lead the Legion of the Damned. The Loremaster continued, charging the party to save the Empire, to save their very world. With that the Falconer pulled a cloth cover off of a simple wooden door frame and the Legate picked up a door and set it into the frame. Opening the door the Legate revealed darkness where the empty frame had once stood. The party indicated their willingness and the Loremaster vanished. Striding in the party walked, each of them in pitch blackness, until Kieran's mind wandered to thoughts of Carric and Aust. With those thoughts they became aware of one another and after some time came upon an armored figure and two doors. Approaching they noted that there was no one in the armor and heard a voice enter their heads, telling them that they needed to make a choice. On one side many deaths, pain and suffering. On the other many deaths, pain and suffering. On one service and misery, on the other service and misery. The choice must be made. Kieran immediately went through the left door, Geth followed suit. Carric was still in turmoil after killing the only friend he'd ever made and realized that those two were all he really had left and followed them through the door. Behind the screen a die rolled.\n\nThe party walked into the common room of an inn. The only occupant, an olive skinned man with brown hair and brown eyes clad in leather looked up at them from a table. \"Welcome to the Adventurer's Guild.\" he said. \"People who come through there always seem to be the right sort for it.\" Kieran asked about going back as he'd left loved ones behind. \"That'll fade, everything from before fades eventually.\" the man replied. \"For now just take one of these, put it on, spend some time thinking about it, and we'll go from there,\" he continued, grabbing three small round buttons from his pocket and handing them to each of the party members. They looked at the man and noticed he was wearing a button of what appeared to be the same silvery metal but it was well adorned and showed his face in the middle. Putting their buttons on the party spent some time drinking and eventually they too had buttons with their faces on them.\n\nThe party asked the man about where they were. They were at Lakeside. Was there a map? A map was provided. The party wasn't familiar with the geography of the map and at its center was an unfamiliar town, Dragonseat. Dragonseat was noted as being the heart of the Empire, the Adventurer's Guild acted in service to the Empire. Who was the ruler? The legacy of The Dragon, of course. Could they just leave? Sure, they're more than welcome to try themselves against the wilderness or go work some farm or at the dam if they're skilled in such things. What's his name? Emil.\n\nDetermining that they'd at least stick around the party was directed to their rooms, first door on the left back down the hallway that was behind them as they'd entered the inn's common room. Open for public, shut for private. Kieran walked into the hall, opened the first door on the left, was met with a rather simple room with a bed, table, chair, and wardrobe. He entered the room and closed the door behind him. Carric knowing that Kieran had taken the first room on the left went for the first door on the right. It would not budge and the man shouted over that it was the first door on the left. Carric went for that one and it opened to a rather simple room with a bed, table, chair, and wardrobe. He went in and closed the door. Geth went through the same process with the same results.\n\nI'm just really glad that they all went through the same door. The other door was a different campaign and it wouldn't have done to have the party split between two separate campaigns.",

        "text": "As a DM, I love to add NPCs that lawful players may WANT to murder, but won’t because they are technically just a nuisance; One such monkey wrench in 3.5 was a Gnome NPC named Rupert Ignatius Pawfoot, or “RIP” for short. He was a conspiracy theorist, extremely paranoid and off his rocker. In short, he was fun to roleplay.   \n\nThe party was told that RIP had vital information for preventing the King’s assassination; Technically this was true. Unfortunately, RIP had loads of other useless information as well. Even though they tracked him down and got to interrogate him, they had no idea what was useful, since RIP wholeheartedly believed all of the gibbering nonsense he said.   \n\nSince *Sense Motive* was useless, the Rogue decided he would just search RIP’s house. Literally every square inch of the floors, the wall and ceiling were covered with diagrams of his various conspiracy theories, as well as make-shift traps.   \n\nThe Wizard tried to *Detect Magic* inside RIP’s house. He nearly went blind from all the light, since RIP had repeatedly cast Nystul’s Magic Aura on literally everything he owned (to throw off the trail of the Dopplegangers that had replaced the City Council and were attempting to poison the water so Owl Bears could eventually control the food service industry).   \n\nThe Party eventually gave up on RIP and left to pursue information elsewhere. RIP didn’t give up on the party. RIP was now convinced that the Party knew “The Truth”, and made it his goal to find out what they knew. He was their constant shadow from then on. More than once they would wake up in the middle of the night to find the Gnome at the foot of their bed, taking frantic notes.   \n\nRIP's plans to infiltrate the party culminated at the King’s Festival (the day of the planned assassination).  \nStep 1: Hired a doxy to lure the Gnomish bard into the alley outside the tavern.  \nStep 2: Chloroformed the bard, removed all of his clothing and hid him.  \nStep 3: Put on **only** the bard’s hat.  \nStep 4: Walked back into the tavern, now cleverly disguised as the bard.   \nStep 5: Sat down next to the Paladin and acted as if nothing was wrong.   \n\nWith a thunderous “**YOU!!!**” the Paladin snatched RIP from his chair and slammed him against the bar. After a few threats, RIP reluctantly showed them where he had stashed the naked bard. The party then locked RIP in the basement of the tavern and told him it was for his own good and that they would come back to deal with him once they saved the King.   \n\nOne foiled assassination attempt, several months and hundreds of miles later, the Paladin stopped in the middle of the street and said in a voice of absolute horror “Oh god, we left RIP in the basement.”",

        "text": "**The continued tale of Malaney Belrue.** [Click here for previous chapter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4gevxb/dnd_5e_those_we_call_friends_and_family/)\n\nI had the most intense dream. The vividness that lingers in my veins makes me wonder if it were a vision, but it’s hard to say. I was playing my Lyro Blade for the masses on the aircraft (I’ll mention it later, I must first get the dream written). Kimaris, Bordel, Aragoth, and Daevri were all eating at a table, my cards from games earlier accompanying them. I had decided to [sing a ballad of a Half-Orc, Champion of Pelor,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnXemMIzKrw) when everything about me seemed to surge. Like, the energies were whisking me away to some far off land.\n\nOnce I was able to gain my bearings, I found that I was in a wasteland- no... it was more plains like, but the atmosphere was dark and dull. I could sense a great war taking place which made me feel all sorts of uncomfortable. \n\nAs I looked about, a cry rang out and I saw a dark figure assaulting a woman. It wasn’t just a strike with the hand. The silhouetted man proceeded to have his way with her. I can’t say if it was the woman who continued to scream or that of my own voice. Like a coward, I ran. There was nothing I could do to help her...\n\nMy flight was short come as another figure caught my attention. She was commanding in appearance. Her face was painted white, markings along her cheeks and eyes. The dress was like nothing I had seen before that magnified the warrioress she was. A golden headdress adorned her crown and for the briefest of moments I forgot the threat behind me.\n\nI then remembered her. She was me- the Primordial of Balance, at least in a previous life. I was mesmerized by her as she walked past. I doubt she ever saw me. \n\nRora- the warrioress, walked straight over to the man, killing him and the woman with two swift motions from her fans. Sorrow for the victim escaped me, wondering why she had to die. It was short lived as my eyes beheld four red orbs in the sky and Rora heading up a hill.\n\nDespite her brutality, I picked myself up and followed after. I felt safe with her and surely I might gain wisdom if I kept with. As we walked, a laughter echoed across the landscape. It was lilt and childlike and chilled my bones. I looked about, but saw nothing. In fact, when I returned my attention to Rora, she was no longer leading me. The warrioress had disappeared all together.\n\nI continued to walk up the hill toward the lights. As I drew nigh, I felt weights in my hands. I looked to them and found the metal fans Rora wielded clenched in my fists. Then the green robes that were wrapped about her frame, billowed in the breeze about my legs. It took but a moment to realize, though I suspect I always was, that I was Rora. \n\nAs I walked on, a calm encased me. The two folk I had murdered was necessary. The man for his vile actions and the woman so she wouldn’t have to live on with the scars. I could feel the weight she carried in making that decision, yet at the same time there wasn’t any guilt. It was a duty to uphold.\n\nAt the top of the hill I saw Bordel, Kimaris, Aragoth, and Daevri, but they too were past manifestations of their Primordial cycle. The Dragonborn, who was a Goliath at the time, beckoned to us to which we all placed a hand on a large stone. Then there’s glimpses of the great Dragon, Io, charging into battle followed by a man with bright red hair reading a book. It was the history of the world, Bordel having observed it and declaring it was accurate.\n\nThen I snapped back to reality, the final chords of the song being plucked incoherently. Some folk applauded and I shook my head feeling embarrassed. I then switched to my other lyre, not quite sure what I had done. \n\nI don’t know why I continued to play for everyone. By the time I decided to finish, I found the Galley empty except for Bordel. \n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n\n\nI think I’ve warmed up to the Cleric again. As I wrote in his quiet company, he began to make small chat about my journal and what I write. I felt nervous, knowing what I’ve written about him, but stated I wrote about the going ons of the day, whatever stood out and seemed important. He then asked if my mother was in there. I chuckled a little, confirming she was. Bordel then surprised me and apologized for snapping at me the other day when I had seemingly foiled our plans to obtain the journals. I felt bashful and brushed it off saying that it was partly my fault for not communicating better. But I certainly feel much better in his good graces. \n\nSomething interesting is Bordel can’t write. I take my skill in that for granted. I tend to assume everyone can. I offered to teach him, but he declined. Then I found out he has no family. I didn’t press about it. The topic only came up when I mentioned I’d help write any letters home. It’s perplexing he has no wife or children back home for his character is so inviting. \n\nThen again maybe they are dead... Or the fact he was the executioner. Maybe that position hindered him. I know if I was still a functioning member of my family, that arrangement wouldn’t hold well with my mother. Thankfully I don’t have to worry about status when it comes to marriage, just my own happiness. Ha! The thought of a wedding sounds so foreign now. I doubt that is part of my Primordial agenda.\n\nSpeaking of my supremeness, I mentioned to Bordel the dream I had. He said he had one too of a similar fashion. I pulled the Lyro Blade out and examined it for auras as the Cleric wondered how the dream was brought about. Bahamut’s gift held no magical effects, which left me equally confused.\n\nBordel eventually got up to leave, I asking him which room Kimaris took. He teased me by saying, “I thought you were sharing with Aragoth?” I told him I wasn’t. I’m not sure what to think about the Dragonborn. He’s a thief and a brute. I don’t feel comfortable being alone behind closed doors with him yet.\n\nMore seriously, Bordel mentioned that Kimaris didn’t take a room and that I was welcome to share his. I accepted the invite saying I’d come down after I finished writing.\n\nWith that, I suppose it would make better sense for me to jot how I even managed to be aboard an airship! But first, everything leading up to it after I had written this morning:\n\nAfter journaling and writing the letter to Achmath, I had grabbed my pack to go to market and get a new dress. I’ve mentioned the feathers growing, but I’m starting to notice more nubs running along my arms and I have no choice but to find an outfit to accommodate the feathers. I haven’t a clue what people will think. Aside from being less modest, will people assume I’m part Aarakocra? \n\nWith my nerves already set with saying goodbye to Achmath and my changes, they were only added upon as I picked my pack up. It was unbelievably heavy! And guess what was inside! The stolen goods! Or at least some of them. I dare not ask where the rest went, but with what I had, I was intent on returning them and sparing the shop some of their loss.\n\nI mentioned to Kimaris, who still was sitting with Daevri, that I was headed to market as I passed through the common room. Once outside, I nearly bumped into Bordel as I lugged the pack along. He was kind and offered to carry it. With enthusiasm I passed the load to him. I then made mention of the items inside and how I was off to return them. He even suggested that I get a top fit for my feathers, as I itched. \n\nIt was rather embarrassing. I say, I don’t know how birds handle it. Ever so often I had to stop and lean against the wall of a building to get a decent scratch. I thought about asking Bordel, but the idea sounded awkward. Perhaps Kimaris will lend a hand later.\n\nAs we slowly made way to the blacksmith I was certain the armor and weapons were from, Bordel and I met up with Aragoth. It was there that it dawned on me that the Dragonborn was a Primordial. I have yet to ask the Cleric about it, but I don’t understand how it was possible. Yet there’s a part of me that seems to know that he’s been one all along, especially considering that vision I had. And the same thing happened with Daevri; he’s one of us (though he was equally surprised, as I was, by his new found power... which may not be a good thing for him)!\n\nAnyways, Aragoth was not happy by the idea of returning the goods. They were to help us save the world according to him. Bordel debated with him, trying to bring reason about how we can’t just take as we please because of our power. Just because we’re to save everyone doesn’t mean to cheat the others of their livelihood. Yet the Dragonborn would counter with, “But does their livelihood matter if the world ends because we were not well equipped?” It was rather comical how he thought we were going about saving the world. Granted, the forces we were taking on to secure the cups might prove threatening, but with two of the ten secured in Bahamut's vaults, I seriously doubt the world is at threat.\n\nThe Cleric thought a long moment and replied, “I suppose I play chess differently than you,” to which the debating continued. I, however, marched off toward the blacksmith, who was berating his help something terrible.\n\n“Excuse me,” I began. The man recognized me, calling me by my formal name. I then presented the stolen items explaining that I had woken with them in my belongings and knowing me, I certainly have no need of them. He thanked me for the return, though was disappointed that only a portion had been salvaged. Bordel then joined me and handed the blacksmith a platinum piece to cover the rest. I thought that quite generous considering Aragoth and Daevri were the culprits that put him out of pocket.\n\nAfter finding a dress fitting for my changes, the three of us returned to the Inn for lunch. There, Bordel asked the others what he asked me while out at market, “What do you think of flying?” I had chuckled considering the feathers I was growing and mentioned that it was something I had yet to do. The Cleric then said that he had a surprise for me. So after everyone else gave their input, no one being opposed to the idea, He mentioned how there was an aircraft that he’s established passage for all of us on.\n\n“Where are we taking the aircraft to?” Kimaris asked. It was a big reminder that Bordel and I hadn’t told the others about what had happened last night at the dinner party! So quickly I relayed that we had a likely source to a cup on Mythus island- but we ought to ask around the docks to see if any of the workers or sailors have heard about it.\n\nKimaris asked what route the aircraft would take. Bordel said it was heading north before going east. The boy then mentioned that he had been summoned by his Master. Something in his eyes suggested it was what we ought to do first, the volcano cup likely safe as it were for a more convenient time.\n\nWith that decision made, we all went down to the aircraft to inquire if we would be able to be dropped off close to Kimaris’s home. As we walked, I did my best to ask some of the folk around the dock about Mythus, but so far no one seems to have heard of such a rumor about a volcano’s treasure.\n\nThen my attention turned to the aircraft. It was quite amazing! The ship must have been something established within the past two years because I never saw it in my time growing up in Ruebis. It held a resemblance to the ships ported, but lacking the sails. \n\nWe were greeted by a Half Orc named Blacmeg. He was courteous and said that they would be stopping at a town near the monastery Kimaris is from. We were then lead to the barracks where we were able to secure three rooms.\n\nI had assumed I would be bunking with Kimaris. Daevri, however, asked if I would want to join with him. I rolled my eyes and jokingly stated, “I’d rather room with the Dragonborn than you.” No sooner had I said it, Aragoth was all, “Sure!” and threw me over his shoulders! I can’t tell you how panicked I felt. He slammed the door behind him and set me down. He then flopped on the bed and muttered something about how they were never big enough for him. I laughed nervously and excused myself.\n\nBefore I left, he did make mention that he wouldn’t ever hurt me. I smiled cordially and slipped out the door. The others had a good laugh over it. I then in full blush made my way up top to have a good looking over of the ship before making my way down into the Galley to entertain with cards and music.\n\nAnd on that note, I am off to bed!",

        "text": "A short while ago, my usual group of players gave Pathfinder another go. Our first experiences with the system quickly decended into minmaxery and dicerolling bullshit. Thanks to a very good GM (at least as long as we're talking combat encounters) we still kept at it and had a lot of fun. Even exterminated basically every elf on the continent by setting their forest on fire. Evil campaings are great.\n\nAnyways, this time it was agreed upon, that we would keep the minmaxing in the basement where it belongs and try to focus more on the roleplaying. A challenge for us, since Pathfinder is a system that just begs to be minmaxed and a challenge for our PF-GM since he is subpar at roleplaying (as we observed with him being a player in other settings).\nThe party consists of the following:\n\nTik Ulf Sommer (Skittnik) and Tok Rolf Winter (Skiven) Ratfolk Twins, Blackjack Mercenary Fighters with a penchant for fake names, gold and reach weapons. Also have Ratfolk Tailblades, as is custom for their kin. During exploration and combat they basically always share the same space and attack at the same time.\n\nBoregard, Gnome Bard Juggler with a poison fetish and far to many chakrams.\n\nAlaton, Half-Elf Gunslinger. This player always plays either an elf or a half-elf and has perfected the art of snobish ignorance towards lesser people by now.\n\nArtusk, Tiefling Rogue and master of stealth. Played by someone who basically always plays rogues. We could have had bets on his characterchoice, but nobody wanted to wager that he wasn't going to play the sneaky-beaky. Had some nice jokes about his Tiefling dad.\n\nAnd finally me: Toruk Stonesmasher, 12th son of the Stonesmasher-Clan, thrown out of his home mountain by his parents for being a disgrace to the clan. Not only is he not grumpy, like a real dwarf should be, no, his favored weapon is a bow. A BOW!!! The hated \"weapon\" of war used by the age old enemy, the elves.\nToruk is a Zen Archer, a battle monk that seeks enlightment by turning his enemies into porcupines. Since he got 900 GP during chargen so that he could afford a bow (usually monks only get 60gp at best, took the rich parents trait) and he is the son of a rich family, he has hired a butler, who is responsible for driving his wagon, setting up the tents and preparing tea. Lots of tea.\n\nOur most memorable encounter to date happened in our third session:\nOur group was exploring the ancient ruins of a city that was somehow turned upside down and smashed into the ground by unknown forces. On the surface some weeping angel gargoyle bullshit was going on and we were spooked. Since our benefactor and questgiver was demanding that we finally get him some decent loot, we ventured deeper into the city and found an entrance leading below the surface. There we encounter a pair of Ratfolk, one who downs a potion and another who begins chanting.\n\nThe potion trinker vanishes into the dark and coming from a fresh campaing of Shadowrun, we do the only reasonable thing: Geek the mage first. The Ratfolk charge-squad deploys and Toruk gets some arrow hits in before the shaman can cast something really ugly. He turns heel and flees.\n\nMeanwhile, potion drinker apparently hulked out, because a giant rat oger like beast jumps into the hallways behind us, charging for our bard and luckily missing his attack. Our already injured rogue (got some from the shaman) steps up to help the bard and starts cutting at the ogre with his rapier. The ogre doesn't give 2 shits.\nMost of my arrows miss, our Gunslinger needs every other round to reload and the ratfolk charge brigade is too far away for now. The bard retreats and our rogue is the only one left on the front against the large rat ogre only to get his ass handed to him. With near zero hp he retreats, but the ratfolk charge brigade is there to take his place!\nDue to not enough movement, they brace their weapons and ready for an attack, the bard right next to them, in the 2 squares wide hallway. The ogre roars and charges the line, impaling himself on the bardiche and horsechopper (looted in a backstory goblin encounter) of the blackjack brigade.\n\nBut he keeps coming! With an even mightier roar, he continues his overrun and tramples the ratfolk twins and the bard, dealing massive damage. The bard is at -2, the twins at 1 and 0 respectively. The ogre stands right in front of Toruk, with the 3 small allies trapped underneath him, one of which is bleeding to death. The Gunslinger drops his empty gun, pulls out his club and charges at the ogre, bringing him dangerously low. Before Toruk can act, it's the ratfolks turn.\nThey look each other in the small, beady, black eyes and a mischievous grin appears on their faces: \"The nuts?\" asks Tik. \"The nuts!\" confirms Tok, both ramming their tailblades up into the rat ogres junk. \n\nThe ogre falls and we called the session after our GM confirmed that we reached level 2.",

        "text": "I run a home-brewed campaign with my own pantheon. With that comes the issue of how I portray the interactions of the gods with mortals. I decided that I would reward my players that get invested in their god and actively try to curry favor and following their principles. I've typically had the gods communicate with their disciples through visions and \"signs\". A couple of sessions ago I decided to be a little more direct...\n\nThe party is in the Dwarven Capital. They just returned from securing a very key alliance and are relaxing at an Inn and are trying to figure out their next move.\n\nNow, I have the party use background skills and our Druid is a professional cook. Like he typically rolls in the 30's for his meals. However, the party likes to roleplay that their characters don't actually like his meal just to tick him off a little. I generally have any NPCs commend his cooking ability just to alleviate the situation.\n\nWell, as usual the party is complaining about his cooking which is irking the Druid, suddenly they hear the sound of a spoon scraping an empty bowl only to look down and see what appears to be a Gnome.\n\nI say appears because this Gnome is dressed most peculiarly. He is wearing pants for a shirt and a shirt for pants. Both of which are clearly too large on him. He has bright green hair that can only be seen sticking out the holes in the boot that he wearing for a hat. The boot is also quite large on him. He has an eyepatch and what appears to be a cape but he wears it more like a cloak. The cloak is covered in an odd patchwork of sewn on pockets imagine like a memory quilt of sorts.\n\nI mention to them that nobody seems to have notice him sidle up to their table but they now all seem to notice him at the same time.\n\nDruid: \"Uhh, can we help you?\"\n\nGnome: \"Yea, can you pass the salt?\"\n\nThey oblige and he continues eating fairly non-nonchalantly\n\nNow I should mention that three of the players have earned their god's legendary relics. The other three players haven't totally committed to their gods or they have yet to secure a lead on their relics location. The relics are all home-brewed and everyone seems to enjoy theirs thus far, but I felt bad that the other three players didn't have something really cool.\n\nThe gnome continues eating with the party looking around unsure how to proceed. \n\nDruid (has a god relic): \"Okay, uh, who are you and what do you want?\"\n\nGnome: \"Me? Oh I'm not terribly interesting but you all seem quite intriguing. Some would say that you have quite the DIVINE presence\" \n\nCue him looking off to the side, almost as if looking to a camera with an almost expectant look on his face.\n\nThe party exchanges confused looks, nobody is really sure what is going on right now.\n\nRogue (also has a god relic): \"What exactly do you mean by that?\"\n\nGnome: \"Well I mean that you three (gestures to the three with relics) have an almost other-worldly or holy presence than these other fine gentlemen. And it just seems like, well, there is too much meddling going on by those that should know better than that by now.\" He continues with a big exclamation \"and I aim to change that and level the playing field a little bit, make things a little more CHAOTIC\" \n\nHe then proceeds to look off to the side once more making the same expression from before. Also, when he looks off to the side he lifts up his eye-patch; he isn't blind, in fact he has different colored eyes and the one beneath the eye-patch has changed colors each time he lifts it.\n\nGnome: \"So, who's first?\"\n\nCleric nervously raises his hand\n\nGnome: \"Ah boy do I have the treat for you, I present the Spokalo of Namerath\" He proceeds to pull out of his pocket, that is far too small to hold it, a wooden wagon wheel without the wheel. In other words the hub and spokes but not the outer wheel. \n\nCleric: Gingerly accepts the gift \"What does it do exactly?\n\nGnome: In a mysterious voice \"When the time comes, you'll know\" He proceeds to look around the table cocking his head to the side like a confused German Shepard \"Next?\"\n\nThe rogue's hand shoots up\n\nGnome: Rummages in a new pocket \"I present to you the Mug of Overflowing Liquid, Fill it once and it shall OVERFLOW\" \n\nWhat he pulls out is a doll's teacup barely larger than a thimble. He scoops a little ale out of one of the PCs mugs and raises it to his lips. It takes several minutes for him to finish drinking after which he hands the gift to the rogue who looks like I had just handed him a live pigeon. Utterly confused.\n\nThe gnomes reaches back into his pocket and pulls out a banana \n\nGnome: \"Whoops that's just Jim's shoe it's not for sale\"\n\nThe Druid's animal companion is an ape who really wanted to eat said banana.\n\nGnome: \"Sorry can't stress it enough, it's not for sale, Jim would be really mad at me, and trust me you do not want Jim mad at you.\"\n\nsadape.jpg\n\nBefore you know it everyone was clamoring to be the next to receive an item which included:\n\nThe Manacles of Diminishing Threat- \"You'd have to be a fool to RESIST wearing these\" A pair of wrought iron manacles that seem to be able to adjust and fit small to large creatures. It comes with a fine key that is affixed to a necklace.\n\nThe Compass of the Wanderer- \"Wander here, wander there, wander everywhere\". The compass clearly doesn't point north and seems almost as if it is tracking something for awhile only to switch to something else after awhile.\n\nThe Mah-Jin of Erah: \"For when you need to account for all the variables\". What appears to be a simple coin, has six different faces. One of which is the Gnome.\n\nThe Dis-Harmonica: \"Ah, the sweet music of madness\". What appears to be a simple, if battered, brass harmonica. When played it sounds more like a pair of out of tune bagpipes being ruthlessly murdered by a tone deaf opera singer regaling us with Rigoletto's Caro nome. \n\nNow that everyone had their gifts, needless to say they were curious. The bard fastens the manacles to himself and instantly shrinks to the size of a mouse. As the bard is shrinking, the rogue overturns his teacup.\n\nSuddenly, 40 gallons of water comes rushing out of the cup sending the handcuffed tiny bard out of the inn and into the foot traffic of a very busy city. The bard had to dodge the feet of pedestrians while the party tried to locate him in the flurry of foot traffic. \n\nAfter securing the bard, finding the fine key that had been washed away, and returning to the inn they found the soaking wet gnome with the biggest grin on his face.\n\nGnome: \"You know, they all said I was MAD for picking you, but I think this will go just perfectly.\"\n\n ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4ifeh3/unknown_armies_3_gamma_playtest_hipster_occultists/",
        "text": "Myself and five friends decided to sit down and do the UA3 Gamma test, using the material available to backers. The GM was /u/SirOphiuchus.\n\nA few notes about UA: the first line of the first book states the following: “Unknown Armies is an occult game about broken people conspiring to fix the world.” And it is completely true. Unknown Armies is a horror game, where the most effective horror can come from the actions your characters have to take to save the world, their country, their city, their families, themselves, or their next hit of PCP. Players play as either normal humans, people who act like behavioural archetypes called avatars, or people whose minds are so broken they use them to break reality and are called adepts. Both adepts and avatars gain magickal power (yes, the game uses the k), avatars by acting like their archetype (examples: the **Mother**, the **True King**), adepts by carrying out their own warped agendas (examples: **entropomancers** gain power through risking their lives for no reason, while **plutomancers** gain power through gaining money). Avatars get benefits based on the level of their skill (up to four abilities, some of which may be passive), while adepts gain minor, significant, and (super duper rarely) major charges, and have formula spells and random magickal effects that cost charges. Both also have a taboo, an action that they can’t take or else they lose power: avatars lose points from their skill (Mothers lose power by harming or letting a child under 16 come to harm, while True Kings lose power if they harm or allow harm to be done to their Realm, their Followers, or any guests to their Realm), while adepts lose all of their charges (entropomancers blow it if they let someone else take a risk they’re unwilling to take, while plutomancers lose everything by spending more than $1000 at once). Adepts also have central taboos, which power their magick - entropomancers gain control of their lives by abandoning all control, while plutomancers gain money but can almost never spend it (and yes, a bill for multiple items coming to a total of $1000 counts). \n\nTo start, the game has collaborative character generation rules, which involve coming up with a group objective, then building characters. To start, we tried doing the character part first, then realised we actually needed a goal so that we weren't all going in different directions. After an hour or so, we realised that we were all using the new forms of magick, and we were using them first. \n\nIn other words, occult hipsters.\n\nAfter this, we continued through the collaborative process. Two characters weren’t adepts or avatars, one was an avatar, and two were adepts. The characters:  \n* Dan Woode, a mendicant barman with some connections to the (actual) occult scene and some skill with rituals (me)  \n* Dáithí Ó Mhuiritigh (GM: “I hate you so much.”), a vinyl record store owner addicted to a memetic record  \n* Jason Thomas, an Apple store worker who was a new avatar: the Hacker, whose whole thing revolves around modifying stuff - the taboo is to use anything without modifying it first (yes, this meant he had to jailbreak his own iPhone), or to prioritise social situations over fixing up their inventions. His character and mine were BFFs  \n* ***MAX POWER***, a cosplaying cinema geek and anime fan who was a new adept class: the Cinemancer, aka Tropeamancer (but only for films). His spells were almost all film references, and worked best if no-one knew what he could do. One spell being, essentially, if he says something and someone else says “There’s no way that would ever happen”, or something similar, he burns some charges, and it does, because that’s the cue in films for it to happen. His taboo is to let the start of a trope go without acting on it (for example, during a car chase, if they see a fruit cart, they have to ram it - the rules add “they tend to be polite but reserved in order to avoid the entanglements of the dreaded ‘meet cute,’as the behavior[sic] of a character in a Rom-Com is usually legally actionable”  \n* Nigel Wrestburn (\"with a double-you\"), a clothes designer and Vestimancer, an adept that uses clothing for power. So, he can do cool things based on the authority and civility his clothing grants him. His taboo is to ever be seen naked, as, without clothes, Man is little better than an animal (and yes, the player had seen Kill la Kill, but that’s the actual reason from the rules).\n\nOur goal, by the way: show them that the new ways are better than the old ones.\n\nOnce we’d finished setting up, there was an OC food break, and then it was time to rock and/or roll. We were sitting outside the Beer Market pub, a beer-only pub in Dublin (oh, also, the game was set in Dublin), when we were approached by a Professor Oats. He’d taught Dáithí before he dropped out, and was a member of the Esoteric Order of Academicians, a staid and old group of occultists and mages made up of Trinity College staff. He’d heard that someone, not naming any names here, had been calling them and their magic old and antiquated in the “... zines”, and he and the Academicians decided to throw down: they challenged us to a float-building competition for the Paddy’s Day Parade. We agreed, and started considering. We eventually decided on a robotic St. Paddy, who would walk down the street, chasing down dancers dressed as snakes. And we had two weeks to do it.\n\nWe split up tasks: Dáithí was responsible for the music, Jason was responsible for the float itself (and redid it slightly when we realised that a float has to, by definition, be attached to a flatbed, according to Wikipedia), Nigel was making the costumes for the dancers, ***MAX*** was asking fellow cosplayers if they wanted to be dancers, and Dan was arranging funding and managing the campaign. Dan wrote an article to submit to Monocle, asking for ideas and funding and stuff, sourced some bioethanol (so that our emissions would meet the parade standards), and got an old storage shed containing large amounts of farm machinery (his BFF Jason had the most enormous smile on his face when he saw that). While working on this, Jason's player informed the GM that he was making a device as part of his avatar’s second channel that would allow him to make someone stop existing for 1d10 hours. During his exploits, ***MAX*** was approached by a friendly old hippie we all knew called Jim, who told ***MAX*** (who was currently cosplaying as Harry Potter) that an evil dark wizard had arrived in town and was planning on destroying our group. In response to being told this, Dáithí's player asked if Jim \"wasn't voting for the Green Party at the time.\"\n\nThe trouble started the next day. The Irish Times wrote an article on us, gently chiding us for being such silly hipsters. Our IndieGoGo campaign was flooded with more vitriol than expected. We had two guys turn up at our storage bay, demanding to know if we were the shit heads trying to “rejuvenate” the north inner city (they were talked down by Dáithí, hooray). \n\nMidway through the first week, Dan and Nigel met the people from the Dublin City Council to try and get the float approval rushed through. They gave us the forms, and said good luck. That night, Nigel, alone at home, closed every curtain and blind and door, stripped, and then started putting on underwear discarded by previous one-night stands with various bureaucrats. A bra, boxers, socks, and gloves. He then put on a full suit, like a bureaucrat would wear, used the spell Dress for Success (if you’re dressed like a particular job, e.g. a pilot or a surgeon, for one hour you can use your Vestimancy skill instead of any and all skills that you’d need to perform that job, e.g. fly a plane or perform open-heart surgery), and rolled a one - a critical success. He filled out the forms perfectly, getting us superb amounts of leeway. After a few seconds, the GM asked the player if he really needed to wear actual clothing from a person or people who have that job. The player said yes. Turned out the answer was no. Cue five minutes of him looking slightly sheepish, and the rest of us laughing so hard we all ran out of breath. It worked, anyway: our proposal was accepted, no questions asked. Just after that, ***MAX*** hacked into Dublin City Council (the player simulated how by slapping his laptop keyboard for a few minutes - because ) and found the submission from the Academicians: a large diorama drawn by two horses. We downloaded it and studied it, but couldn't modify it: this was a scan of a hard copy, which meant they had one, and modifying this would be noticed.\n\nBy this stage, we’d settled on a design: the float would work as a float, with St. Paddy sitting on a throne in his usual clothes. When we pushed a button, however, he’d stand up off the throne, his old robes dropping away to reveal a younger and more modern take on St. Paddy (which resembled Liam Neeson, thanks to a suggestion by ***MAX***).\n\nMy suspicions that someone was doing something was verified when an English man entered Dáithí’s store and started talking about the project. After a few minutes, random people started walking into the store, doing nothing but staring at the two conversing. After ten minutes, twenty people stood inside, watching the unperturbed English man and the increasingly perturbed Dáithí. At one point, the man asked if Dáithí would see himself as a hipster; Dáithí responded that he was just a young man trying to do good. The man smiled, clasped Dáithí’s hand, and walked away.\n\nDáithí came to talk to us. We had no idea why, he was never really part of our group. He seemed like a decent sort, but, really, we’d no idea why he was even there. He wasn't a hipster, after all, and he’d never been one. Nigel, who had been attempting to teach him to have an actual fashion sense, twigged that something seemed off, borrowed his hoodie (shuddering as he put it on), then used a spell to determine that Dáithí had been put under a curse. Dan came up with a ritual to remove any malign influences on us and bounce them back, and Nigel threw a large amount of power into it in an attempt to hurt the person in question. What he got back was a man who was now cursed to never dress fashionably again. And didn't care.\n\nSpecifically, he didn't care he’d never dress fashionably again. He didn't care that we hated him. He did, in fact, not care about, or feel, anything at all. \n\nBut the ritual worked. We remembered that Dáithí was, and always had been, one of us, Dan sat down for a few hours to get over the backlash from the ritual (being greatly comforted by Jason’s tuneless humming and constant talking), and work continued apace. Before the big day dawned, Dan came up with a working to protect us and our float, which would trigger when our giant animatronic St. Patrick stood up and the music switched from diddley-aye music to Kila. \n\nThe next day dawned well. We arrived at the Garden of Remembrance, and were after the Academicians, who had their big diorama under an awning. We got in the queue, and set off eventually. The awning was removed from the Academician’s float to reveal a rotating diorama of the architecture of Dublin, made out of onyx and glass, with the Spire in the centre - even we were impressed, though we noticed no people in the diorama. We were planning on making our big reveal on O’Connell Bridge. Just as we passed the Spire, however, the Academician’s Spire flashed, and everyone made checks to withstand supernatural phenomena. Everyone in the party either had the hardened notches to ignore it, or rolled and passed. The crowd, however, failed to do so. Before anything could happen, an Englishman’s voice rolled out of the crowd and said “Smash it!” - just as Jason fired his time-out beam at him, removing him from reality for 4 hours. At which point, we got to see the mob rules.\n\nThe GM rolled some dice, added some modifiers, and said that the targets of the mob, the Academicians, would be taking 51 damage a *second*. The standard health of characters, by the way, is 50 wound points. Anyone nearby would be taking 7 a second - unless they did something to mark them out as targets, at which point they’d take the 51 as well.\n\nAt this point, we all did various things to calm the crowd before they murdered everyone - Dan checked if his ritual would work (I failed, and then the GM rolled for it and failed as well), then ran up to Jason yelling \"Activate the Paddy!\", ***MAX*** supposed they wouldn't go home for lunch and then made it happen to some rioters when someone responded that there was no way that would ever happen, Dáithí cued calming music, Nigel used the speaker system and A Fancy Hat (a spell, makes people do what you want if you’re wearing a hat of authority) to try get the crowd to simmer down, and Jason pushed the button. St. Paddy stood up, threw off his vestments, and the ritual didn't go off, since it was tied to both the standing up and the music changing, and the latter hadn't happened. Nigel's voice boomed out and told the people to calm down \"for I am St. Patrick!\" Several people decided, y'know what, let's just go home, this is getting dangerous. The end result was the mob dissolving, apart from a few hard lads, who got jumped by the Gardaí before long. The party gave the Academicians a ride, politely didn't point out that they’d won the challenge, and got given the freedom of the city by the Lord Mayor. And thus, the game ended.",

        "text": "Just ran the greatest and most dramatic boss battle in my entire career as a DM. I really wanted to share it but this is a ridiculous convoluted soap opera of a campaign, so it'll need some background. This is going to be a long one. \n\nThe story so far: The party is on the island of Ignasi, a colonial territory controlled by the nation of Nevarez but sought after by the rival empire of Rodia. One of the rulers of the island, Marquis Efrain Belmosi, has gone missing. The party has discovered that he is likely trapped on an alternate plane, and they have to assemble an extraterrestrial device called the Astrolabe to bring him back. So far they have three pieces and need to find the last one.\n\nThe important characters and NPCs:\n\n**Elle/Symon** - PC human ranger, who was recently knighted by Marquess Ravella, the highest authority on the island of Ignasi. Elle was born a commoner, but through service to the marquess she has been able to gain a noble title. Recently her relationship with Ravella has gotten a bit more... personal. She also has a magic ring that changes her gender (used mostly for disguise, but there's some other uses).\n\n**Calypso** - PC tiefling bard, the crown princess of the rival nation of Rodia. Things have not been going well for her ever since she was shipwrecked in Ignasi on enemy soil. A few sessions ago, she wrote home to request several undercover government agents to protect her and help locate the infamous criminal Malcer Stormwind and his thieves' guild, who scammed her out of quite a bit of money.\n\n**Rowan** - PC human fighter, from the Shimmering Isles (actual name of a country in this campaign setting). He briefly considered joining the thieves' guild, but after receiving word that his family was killed, he's become a loyal worshipper of Tyr and a defender of justice. He still believes in showing mercy to the guild, though.\n\n**Ravella** - The Marquess of Ignasi. She's a powerful fighter and brilliant military tactician, but awkward when it comes to diplomacy and social situations. With her twin brother Efrain missing, she is feeling overwhelmed by her responsibilities and the increasing tensions with other nations.\n\n**Sinead** - A 14 year old girl. She's a prodigy who is secretly the most wanted criminal in Ignasi, \"Malcer Stormwind\" (generally believed to be an adult man), the leader of the thieves' guild. She wants the planar travel device the party is assembling, and is the only one who knows where the last piece is. She's currently disguised as \"Luciana,\" a wealthy merchant's daughter who has been friends with Ravella for several years. The most ridiculous NPC I have ever created.\n\n**Cicero** - One of the Rodian spies, and a friend of Princess Calypso from childhood. He is loyal to his country but wishes to avoid unneccessary conflict, and is willing to work together with Ignasi as long as Calypso is protected.\n\n**Darion** - Another Rodian spy, Cicero's superior and insistent that he is loyal to Calypso's parents first and foremost. He thinks Calypso has made a lot of irresponsible decisions while stuck here in Ignasi. The party recently found out he's a warlock who made a pact with the same devil who gave the Rodian royal family their tiefling heritage.\n\n**Lenore** - A mysterious necromancer who likes talking to books, leaving devilish symbols painted on the walls in blood and showing up where she isn't invited. The party isn't really sure what Lenore is up to. Neither is she.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point in the campaign, the party is being pursued by a revenant who was formerly a wizard and a member of Sinead's thieves guild. When the party first met Sinead, she and another guild member were disguised as Rodian spies offering to help Calypso escape Ignasi (if she can just help raise the funds to get them a boat and a crew). After being given several thousand gold worth of valuables, Sinead faked her own death. One of the guild members was posing as an assassin, Rowan killed him, and now he's undead and out for revenge. The party witnessed Lenore the necromancer raise him from the dead with the help of a devil, and he's been pursuing them ever since.\n\nThe revenant is also after the thieve's guild for leading him into a botched plan that got him killed. Sinead's made a deal that if the party can kill the revenant, she will tell them where to find the last piece of the Astrolabe is, so that they can rescue Ravella's brother.\n\nOf course, Sinead just wants the Astrolabe for herself because planar travel devices are cool.\n\nThe party has returned to the capital city to meet with Marquess Ravella, who introduces them to her old friend \"Luciana Montoya,\" who they instantly recognize as Sinead. They have no solid evidence of her actual identity, so convincing Ravella that this teenage girl is a dangerous criminal is going to be difficult.\n\nOn this particular dark and stormy night, Elle (as her male counterpart, Symon) and Ravella are spending the night together (and it's Symon's birthday, oh myyy). Meanwhile, Cicero takes Calypso aside and admits to her that his fellow agent, Darion, harbors no goodwill for Ignasi and may be planning to do something rash. Rowan happens to overhear this as well.\n\nThat's when they hear fighting downstairs.\n\nAfter rushing to the scene, they find several Ignasian guards fighting animated skeletons. Darion the warlock is nowhere to be seen, and the party suspects his involvement. As soon as Sinead/\"Luciana\" sees a few skeletons, she stops in her tracks, and the party realizes why she wanted them to kill the revenant for her - she's absolutely terrified of ghosts and undead.\n\nThe stairs led down into the castle atrium, so there are entrances on all sides and the party isn't sure what exactly is going on. Darion arrives soon, so this probably isn't his fault. Everyone defends their position as more skeletons break into the room. It's not a difficult fight until the revenant shows up.\n\nAs soon as Sinead sees it, she bolts. Rowan hears her very quietly say \"It wasn't my fault\" before she's out the door.\n\nSymon runs after her to hold her down and bring her back into the room. He enters the castle armory where blood is scrawled across the floor, with a message: \"FOR NEVER CAN TRUE RECONCILEMENT GROW WHERE WOUNDS OF DEADLY HATE HAVE PIERCED SO DEEP.\" Everyone has seen messages like this before, so it pretty much confirms that Lenore is somewhere in the castle, and she's probably a bigger threat than even the revenant.\n\nAll Ravella sees is that her friend \"Luciana\" is scared out of her mind. Symon drags Sinead back into the room, and Ravella agrees it's probably safest to keep everyone together.\n\nCicero has gone into a different room, where he found some of the Ignasian soldiers fighting off more skeletons and offered assistance.\n\nThe revenant now sees most of its sworn enemies in the same room, but his main goal is Sinead, the leader of the thieves' guild who led him into a doomed mission to his death.\n\nCalypso heads towards the castle entrance, where she finds out where all the skeletons and the revenant came from. Lenore is standing there waiting for them. Calypso calls Symon and Rowan into the room to help her fight.\n\nNow, with none of the player characters there to witness this, what happens next is a bit of a mystery. They hear an explosion from the room they just left, Ravella screams in pain, then Darion yells but his voice is quickly cut off.\n\nCalypso runs into the room and finds Ravella and \"Luciana\" both badly burned. Darion is dead on the floor with a knife in his throat. The revenant is still standing, but the spell wasn't aimed at him at all. As it turns out, Darion saw the chaos of this battle as an opportunity to assassinate the Marquess, making it look like an accident, and plunging Ignasi into chaos with both of its leaders gone.\n\nHe wasn't expecting to be killed in one hit by the 14-year-old girl.\n\nThe party won't find this out until later, but over the years that Sinead has used her \"Luciana\" disguise, she's come to genuinely respect Ravella. She cares about her enough that seeing her in danger caused her to immediately rush to her aid.\n\nThe revenant continues to advance towards Sinead, who remembers again that she's terrified of this thing. Ravella is dazed from almost being assassinated, and a bit surprised at her young friend's aim with a dagger.\n\nThe players actually decide that Ravella needs to witness the revenant targeting \"Luciana,\" which would finally give her evidence that the girl isn't who she says she is. They keep fighting it but let it live until it can attack her. Sinead keeps running, it goes after her but she dodges out of the way.\n\nRowan gets the final blow on it, using a blessed sword to cut off its head with radiant damage. As soon as it's dead, the ashes are stuffed into a Bag of Devouring to prevent the revenant from reforming the next day (since it's pulled into an extraplanar space, with no other corpses to take over).\n\nCalypso ran after Sinead and has her pinned up against the wall to interrogate her after killing one of her men. Ravella runs after her too. With one of the Rodian spies dead, that could be the catalyst for a war between the two countries. Sinead looks at Calypso and tells her to inform the king and queen of Rodia that their agent was killed by Malcer Stormwind, the infamous criminal, and NOT by any Ignasian soldiers.\n\nShe also asks that, in Calypso's letter, she make Malcer Stormwind sound really scary and cool. She has an image to maintain.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter all that, here's where we are:\n\nSinead has agreed to tell the party where the final piece of the Astrolabe is. She's admitted that it is on the peak of Ignasi's highest mountain, but there's more standing between them and the piece that she still needs to explain. That'll happen in the morning.\n\nShe also revealed herself as the most wanted criminal in Ignasi right in front of the Marquess.\n\nRavella slept all night after the attack and her attempted murder. When she finally woke up, she had a sweet heart-to-heart with Elle/Symon, then things turned steamy. Elle's sex change ring isn't just cosmetic. There's some magical lesbian spawn on the way.\n\nCalypso is writing to her parents about what happened. War might be imminent.\n\nTL;DR: This campaign is a tangled web of lies, espionage, and drama that's gotten too convoluted to explain in a TL;DR. I love being a DM.",

        "text": "**THIS POST WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR SCENARIO #23 IN THE BASE GAME OF BETRAYAL AT THE HOUSE ON THE HILL.  YE BE WARNED.**\n\nA few things to note about BaTHotH:\n\n* A character's \"Might\" rating refers to the number of die cast, in certain situations.  1 Might = 1 die cast, 4 Might = 4 dice cast\n* Dice have 2 sides worth 0, 2 sides worth 1, and 2 sides worth 2.\n* In confrontations, the attacker wins on a tie\n* There are more rules, but those shouldn't be too relevant here\n\nWe had 6 players.  We explored the house, finding all kinds of rooms.  Red's first move is to run up the stairs and out the rear door - into the tower.  Into cobwebs.  These cobwebs will keep Red from doing anything for a long time.\n\nEventually we reveal the scenario - Tentacles!.  One of our players (Violet) had previously managed to find the Sacrificial Dagger, and amass 8 knowledge and 5 might - this makes her nigh invulnerable because the dagger lets her increase her might to 8, and her knowledge gives her a very strong chance to avoid any negative side effects of the item.  I had been the revealer; lucky Blue.  Poor Father Rhinehart is dragged away in two pieces, screaming and then silenced as the monster ends him with a single meaty crunch.  (He becomes the monster's player)\n\nThe first turn we spent trying to run away from the tentacles because they spawned all around our players - trapping Green in the basement with no way out, and three tentacles closing in.  Red *finally* breaks free of the cobwebs and the tower, and starts making their way back in this round.  Nice timing, Red.  Glad you could join us.\n\nAs the bearer of the crystal ball, I failed my first roll to reveal the head's location, and thankfully was spared as the tentacles went for Yellow, further past me.  The next time around, I used my Adrenaline shot to guarantee the reveal, and we found the head - in the underground lake, same tile as a tentacle arm!\n\nWe rushed the head.  Green was in the lake when we got there, fighting for his life - he fought valiantly and survived as we made it there.  An epic battle ensued - players rescuing each other, fighting the head and suckers, and Violet managed to even do damage - twice!  One more hit to the tentacle head, and we would win the scenario!  We were on top of the world.\n\nBut then, disaster would strike.  Red was fast but useless in a fight due to low Might, and explored past the lake to find the larder.  We tactically retreated, taking the opportunity to might up while we could as the Larder gave us all permanent +1 Might.  Except Red, who *never stopped in the larder*  Unfortunately this cost Green their life as they couldn't escape the tentacles this time and we weren't there to free them.  And so our first player died, torn to shreds in front of young little Yellow.  We accepted their loss - they didn't have the Might to survive, and we needed to regroup to go for the head again.\n\nLittle Yellow followed soon after, pulled into another part of the cellar and rent limb from limb.\n\nAnd then the tentacles killed Violet.  Her Sanity had been a little low, and as she was grappled (the result of a bad roll even on 8 dice), she dropped all her items - and their drop penalties pushed her sanity below 0.  The tentacles invaded the room, and the only weapon that could kill the head was lost and irretrievable.\n\nSo, we're now down by 3 players.  It's just me and Red.  I have 4 might, and Red has amassed...  3.  3 Might, and the tentacles are up to 7.  How lucky for us, and we're both unarmed - time to start playing crazy.  We're going to lose, I just know it.  But we soldier on - the tentacles finally release the mystic elevator and we shuffle Red onto it in a chance to go for the blood dagger that was laying around on the top floor near Rhinehart took his last breath.  We get lucky, and are able to get Red up there (but still in the elevator) while I remain grappled down in the cellar.  I figure I'm dead son, and have no hope, but I resolve to try to break free anyways.\n\nBut then on the next round we realize something - the tentacles left Violet's corpse.  The items are free for the taking!  We roll to get Red down there..  no go.  The mystic elevator stops on the ground floor a short distance from another tentacle.  Well, my turn.  Time to die...  I roll the mystic elevator anyways, and it crashes to the cellar near me.  Red takes 1 physical damage, but his armour blocks it and he's fine.\n\nI get extremely lucky.  A high roll on 4 might, and a low roll from the tentacle's 7 might, and I break free and it retreats.  Now I realize something - I have enough speed to *just* get to the items Violet dropped!  The tentacles left that room to go after Red when he was on the third floor!\n\nI gun it.  Off to the items, and I pick them all up.  My might climbs, so do my other stats.  I can defend myself!  I have the sanity (and speed) to spare to use the dagger on the tentacles and head!  Next turn, *we are winning this*.  The monster goes next..  and I fight off the tentacles.  The other ones can't move far  enough to stop me from getting to the head this turn, and end their turns next to it.  If we go in, we're not gonna be coming out.  But it's okay, because as Violet I'm going to win this, we know it for sure.  We're confident.  Confident enough to send Red in first as they roll before me, with his puny 3 might against the tentacle head's 6 might.  Sure, it'll probably kill Red, but whatever.\n\nRed rolls a 1.  Welp, nice knowing you Red.  I wonder how much Tentacle Head will roll, with his 6 might (and thus, 6 dice to roll).  But wait! I say - Red rolled a 1.  We could still win this, I joke.\n\nThe monster player rolls.\n\n**1**.\n\nIn a tie, the attacker wins.\n\nFriggin' Red, who up until now had failed every roll, never found a weapon, and only just managed to find some prop armour, runs into the abandoned lake, takes a flying leap, trips, and still manages to kill the monster to win the game.  Everyone at the table (minus the monster's player) bursts out laughing.  Our \nbrightest and strongest were dead, scraps of flesh strewn around the cellar, and mister speedy managed to kill the beast by *tripping*.\n\nAnd thus ended our round of Betrayal at the House on the Hill.  And probably a certain tentacle monster's pride.",

        "text": "It's been at least five years since I played, but I remember Rogue Trader as one of the best role playing games I've made poor decisions in. I played Captain Tristan, a spoiled noble with bloodlines leading back to Holy Terra.  Within a couple sessions, Tristan failed multiple sanity checks and became unhinged, which was wonderful for our adventure.  \n\nSome of my favorite stories:  \n  \n- Morale was down, so Tristan decided to improve it. He commissioned knives engraved with his name and face, commemorating one of his many victories. He gave a knife and a grenade to every man, woman and child on board the ship as a gift. Morale swiftly improved, as did fatal knife and grenade fights.  \n  \n- Tristan decided to take over ordering supplies for the Seneschal, despite protests. He filled multiple cargo bays with nothing but glow globes, then ordered crew be assigned to ensure they remain lit around the clock.  \n  \n- When making special orders, Tristan would routinely order superior products for himself and slightly defective knockoffs for his staff; since they were not Noble, there's no way they could appreciate the best anyway. You can guess what happened when the tech priest attempted to use his discount jet pack.  \n  \n- After visiting an Imperial pleasure world, he ordered corridors converted into canals throughout the ship, in order to better use his speedboat for water skiing. This actually came in handy when a rival ship attempted to board us and suddenly found themselves drowning.  \n  \n- During sleep cycles, Tristan would go on the ship's intercom system and softly whisper reassuring subliminal messages to the crew. (Sho hey HEY!)  \n  \n- Captain Tristan had problems navigating public areas. He had grown up on the ship and thus was used to the Tenebro maze within. Ordinary corridors without secret doors, false staircases, holographic dead-ends or illusory walls confused him. He was hours late to a conference with a planetary governor because of the straight path to his office.  \n  \n- Tristan named his planetary colony \"Captain Tristania\". He named the nearby star cluster \"Compare\", so when he advertised it on Imperial broadcasts he could truthfully say that Captain Tristania was an agri-world beyond Compare. \n  \n- At one point we were tasked with investigating a genestealer cult on a jungle planet. Our mission was designated top secret, meaning we couldn't mention ~~Genestealers~~ or ~~Tyranids~~ or anything related to our mission. We wracked our brains about how to approach this for a good ten minutes before Tristan decided he had solved the problem. We landed a Tequila Lander a couple miles from the local agri-settlement and marched there under cover of darkness. Appearing out of the jungle in the middle of the night with a platoon of heavily armed spacemen in tow, Tristan confidently marched to the town center and asked the first person he met \"Have you heard any strange rumors?\" The GM and the character were both at a loss for words. \"Uh... No?\" With that answer, Tristan and the platoon vanished back into the jungle. By the third or fourth settlement, there was a strange rumor spreading of an army coming out of nowhere to ask extremely vague questions.  \n  \n- When we defeated an arch-rival and captured him, the initial recommendation of the Seneschal and the Arch-Militant was to execute him for all of the horrible shit and slander he had put us through. Instead, Tristan ordered him to be held in the brig, except for 8 hours of the day. From 9 to 5, he would reside in the main recreational hall and would be required to give a sincere apology to any crew member that wanted one. We had to arrange a schedule by deck so everyone didn't abandon their posts at the same time to get their apology. Over the course of three months, he apologized to almost every crew member.  \n  \n- His bodyguard was a PC Arch-Militant named Malechai. To keep Malechai from becoming complacent, Tristan put out a bounty, stating whichever crew member assassinated him would get his job and relatively cushy quarters. Tristan then promptly forgot about issuing the bounty in the first place.  \n  \n- Concerned about the multiple attempts on his bodyguard's life, Captain Tristan asked what security measures were in place aboard the ship. None, apparently. The Seneschal had no idea how many crew members were aboard the ship, who they were, or honestly how things functioned in general (to be fair, most Mayors of cities can't name every citizen either). To correct this, Tristan took decisive action- He bought the shittiest security doors available and demanded them installed in every corridor (even the underwater ones). Tristan then demanded a crew tracking program in the form of microchips; He determined the best way to administer the microchips was by shooting crew members with tranquilizers and tagging them while they were unconscious. Thus began the great hunt, conducted mostly from his speed boat.  \n- The Arch-Militant was almost as chaotic as Tristan. He was from a Death World, and had almost no regard to rules, regulations, or manners. He frequently rode his motorcycle from his living quarters to the bridge. I honestly think most of our crew were terrified of being in the corridors between him and the boat.  \n  \n- During an inquisitorial conference, right in the middle of the High Inquisitor's dramatic quest speech, my friend playing the arch-militant stood up, said **\"I have to poop!\"** and rushed to the bathroom. GM naturally kept this as what Malechai did in-game as well. At the time I was certain he had signed our death warrants, but in the long run I think it proved that were were too incompetent (and incontinent) to be disloyal to the Imperium.  \n  \n- Malechai's dice were great for battles, but abysmal for acquisition rolls. He used one of those clear d10s that has another d10 inside of it for rolling d100. Over and over again, he would fail at finding grav-plates, to the point that merchants were getting annoyed with him asking. Finally, the last time he rolled for them, the outer die casing actually shattered on the table. Our GM ruled that he had failed so badly that he was perma-banned from the markets.  \n  \nHave any good, similar Rogue Trader stories to share?",

        "text": "This is a Pathfinder game.\n\nThe party sorcerer got invited to to take care of a 'rat problem' by an attractive local npc, the daughter of the shop with the 'rat problem'.  In a strange mix of paranoia and voyeurism (not his first), the party rogue, who goes by 'Cut', follows them.\n\nJust as the sorcerer, the npc are getting to the good part, her father arrives at the shop and heads to the basement, down the very stairs the rogue where the rogue is hiding/watching.\n\nThis npc, Ven, has a good perception check, and notices the rogue.  Who immediately freaks out and tumbles (acrobatics) past him.  Ven starts to follow, but remembers his daughter is minding the store and didn't see her upstairs.  Maybe the thief isn't alone, so he turns to check on his daughter, who is still naked from the waist up.  So Cut makes a decision to draw the shopkeep off.  He throws a dagger, intentionally missing.\n\nMission accomplished.  Ven is furious, and runs up to Cut and punches the ever living fuck out of him (Improved Unarmed Combat).  Cut, not wanting to murder a man in the town the PCs are operating out of (and secretly doubting that he can at this point), runs for it.  With Ven hot on his heels.\n\nNow the chase begins and this is where Cut starts to realize he pissed off the wrong person.  He sprints out of the store, but Ven is keeping pace, so Cut decides to climb a building and vaults off some barrels and straight pulls some Assassin's Creed shit up the side of that building (climb).  Ven follows, losing no distance (climb).\n\nNext, he leaps to across an alley to another building (jump), with Ven close behind (jump).  Ven is gaining.  Cut jumps off the buliding (jump), but fucks it up, though he manages to land gracefully (acrobatics).  Ven vaults off the building (jump check), and Cut narrowly manages to dart past him and around a corner before ducking into some shadows (stealth).\n\nVen rounds the corner and spots Cut immediately (perception), Cut narrowly manages to dart away from Ven (acrobatics).  He runs again, Ven close behind now.\n\nIn desperation Cut clambers up another building (climb), and this time Ven trips (failed climb).  Using this time, he finally manages to get away from the shopkeep who apparently descended from Inevitables.\n\nKeep in mind that none of this was in some abandoned part of town.  Oh no.  This chase was seen by a *bunch* of both townsfolk and guards.  Only the rogue's paranoia, which kept him in unusual garments, kept him from being recognized.\n\nAs a result of this chase, Ven is now the sort of shopkeep that no one robs because he will *chase them down and beat them to within an inch of their lives* before turning them over to the town guard.  The guards didn't intervene out of apathy, but because they didn't want to get between Ven and his prey.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4i63h0/my_first_rp_experience_and_my_characters_idiotic/",
        "text": "When I first came to university, I didn't have much experience in tabletop RPGs, but when I got here, the gaming society was limited in options to just tabletop RPs and Magic the Gathering, with not much else (this has thankfully changed this year with me on the committee, but I digress). I decided to try out the tabletop RPs, and made a character who was intended to be a joke called Trevor Dun Dun. Little did I know he'd go on one of the most downright ridiculous adventures I could imagine.\n\nDuring character creation, where I made him into a 1-metre tall Droyne, I decided his career path would be that of a smuggler...until I was told he was too dumb for that, so made him a scavenger...and he got kicked out of that career path, so became a wanderer - the career path that it's almost impossible to get kicked out of. I got kicked out of the wanderer career path in the first term, forcing him to join the special forces as a secret agent...where he did surprisingly well. He then went on to become a bounty hunter, and hit level 4 prestige in this career path. This resulted in him getting 4 bonuses, for which I rolled two 3s and two 5s. The DM turned to me and said \"pick out two guns, two types of armour and two other weapons of your choice (within reason)\"...I burst out laughing at the realisation that I'd accidentally made a bug-version of Rocket Raccoon\n\nDun Dun joined a team of other colourful characters on the crew of the Baracuda, and became the team's scout-sniper, recon specialist and weapon/explosives expert, led by a captain who's name has unfortunately been lost to history (I think it was Varkyr). Also on the team at the start were Kassadin al Azir, a psionics specialist, Ajani Shepherd, a seasoned military veteran who got called back into the military after trying to change his course, Linda, a disgraced hiver noblewoman who spoke with a Stephen Hawking-esque voice synthesiser, and the ship's equivalent of R2-D2, FES (controlled by the DM). We also picked up along the way Malgnus, a synthetic-stone-space-troll-cybernetic-thing (he was tanky - that's all you need to know), and GARRI, a racist loading robot - both of whom joined our team of rag-tag misfits. I could probably sit here typing about the exploits of all these characters for a long time, but I'm only going to cover the ones that involved mine\n\nThe first major thing that Dun Dun pulled off happened when we came across a radioactive waste. We sent our psion out to investigate, and he came back with bullhorns. After this, one by one, we all went out and basked in the radiation, coming back with varying mutations. My mutation was that I had cells that wouldn't die or age - I effectively had Deathstroke's healing factor. I could still be mortally wounded and killed, but I couldn't die of ageing.  \n\nThe next major exploit put's Dun Dun in quite a humliating situation. We basically had a loyalty mission for Ajani Shepherd which involved him marrying a noblewoman in order to secure some territory and an alliance where we could rest - but we had to first prove ourselves to her family by retrieving a jewel from a dinosaur-like creature with thick armour and the jewel in it's head. We decided that, since it was something our bullets wouldn't easily pierce, we'd blow it up from the inside - but we couldn't put the explosives in it's mouth, or we'd risk damaging the jewel, so we'd had to go in the other end...guess who wound up flying up a dinosaur's butt to plant the explosives, and then got pulled out of said butt to be thrown into a pile of dinosaur dung. Trevor Dun Dun was having the worst day that day...and needed several showers prior to the wedding ceremony.\n\nThankfully, that was the last crap job Dun Dun ever had, and his combat prowess proved to be where he truly shined - namely, shooting people in the face. He's even managed to shoot people at close-range with his sniper rifle without any issues whatsoever, and always performed well in combat situations. But his greatest feat in combat involved him using his meagre strength stat to topple a man wearing power armour, in what was known as the \"Dun Dun Suplex\", something I've talked about before. Basically, imagine the three strong-men of our party failing the grapple, and then the weakest member running up and succeeding on the grapple, slamming the man in power armour into the ground, head first. When it got to our captain's turn, he said \"What the fuck just happened?\", and I nearly died laughing that night from the events that occurred. \n\nAfter this, we finally got to Dun Dun's own loyalty mission, which involved tracking down his old rival, Abdul - the Most Irish Man to Ever Irish (everything about Dun Dun was a joke - including his contacts and rivals). It started with us trying to sneak onto his battle station, which was the equivalent of the Death Star, and while some of us pretended to get captured, Linda and myself snuck through the air vents in order to try and find our way to Abdul. This didn't end well, as the vent collapsed right above the canteen area, where several soldiers were having lunch...and they just saw a tiny bug man and a hiver crash onto one of the big tables in the middle of the room. Luckily, Linda and Dun Dun weren't in as much trouble as they could've been. Linda convinced the soldiers that they were actually in HER canteen, and had to get the hell out! The soldiers left, but some were headed our way - we had to hide...and we rolled perfect for stealth. This meant we were disguised as bar staff for the whole time we were there. \n\nIt's safe to say that since then, I've tried to not take the characters I create too seriously, in order to make them more fun and enjoyable (as well as eccentric). Dun Dun was the first of many such eccentric characters, with a habit of naming his weapons (names often along the lines of Mr. Squibbly, Cuddles and other not-so-serious names), getting extremely excited at the sight of explosions, enjoying his murderous rampages and often acting recklessly to benefit the team. If it weren't for this character, I'd probably never have truly got into tabletop gaming - the other characters, players and the GM all made it such an enjoyable experience, and I'm so glad he ever manifested in my mind - I just had to share some of his idiotic exploits on here. I hope you appreciate them",

        "text": "This story is a continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4h2op4/a_tale_of_revolution_and_spontaneously_combusting/)\n\nOur tale today begins in the town the party arrived in last story. Coraim has just finished using bardic knowledge and the party is off the buy a crossbow for Vido. When they get to the weapons store they see that all the crossbows are in terrible condition, and Vido asks the shopkeeper where he can get one repaired. The shopkeeper says the crossbows are fine, just a tad used. Vido proceeds to prove the crossbow's defectiveness by hitting Iaghar with it, shattering it instantly. After some arguing over whether crossbows are supposed to do that or not, Vido punches the shopkeeper, and a fight breaks out. We wanted to just knock him out but the shopkeeper just had to run, potentially attracting witnesses, so Coraim shot him in the back, exploding his torso with a critical hit, and burned down the shop.\n\nWalking away from the burning shop, the party saw two taverns, one run down and abandoned, and one lively and raucous, they opted to go into the lively tavern. Coraim saw there was a bard playing in the tavern and challenged him to a rock-off, the bard accepted with some friendly protest. Coraim and the bard made opposing perform checks. The bard played Here Comes the Sun on lute, while Coraim played a metal cover of Dragonborn from Skyrim, also on lute... the bard rolled a natural 20. Everyone in the audience cheered, while Coraim's performance was meh at best, and following that performance it was considered terrible. After admitting defeat Coraim thought this would be a good time to rally the people in rebellion against the king (maybe it would have gone better if he had won the rock-off), unsurprisingly no one was interested, and the people continued with their drinks. The party then went to get a room, which they were surprisingly given for free, and they slept for the night. \n\nWhen the party woke up they were brought oatmeal, also free, everyone ate it immediately except Coraim, who was convinced something suspicious was happening in this tavern. After waiting a few minutes for the others to be drugged by the oatmeal Coraim ate. Later Vido wanted to go out robbing houses, but Lexter and Iaghar were strangely intent on keeping Vido in the tavern, telling him super creepily to \"enjoy the merriment\", and when he tried to leave they tackled him. The whole affair reminded me of the Lotus Flower in Percy Jackson. Meanwhile Coraim was writing a flier for the revolution in the room, he'd come up with the name, The People's Revolution of Mirrodin, but he needed a meeting place for new recruits. The abandoned tavern sounded good but he didn't know what it was called, so he tried to leave to go check the sign, and was stopped by Iaghar and Lexter. After Lexter tackled him Coraim shot Lexter with his crossbow in self defense, knocking him unconscious. Iaghar stopped trying to stop Vido long enough for Coraim to stabilize Lexter, but still blocked the door. After that Coraim cast detect magic, and detected very strong magic in an upstairs room. Around this time Vido was acting strange too, talking about merriment. Coraim went to investigate the source of the magic and found the barkeep exiting the room in question. Coraim asked him about the magical aura he detected, and got a bullshit answer about flux matrices or something like that, so Coraim started threatening him. The intimidation failed however and the barkeep pulled out a wand, pointed it at Coraim, and Coraim began to uncontrollably do the Macarena. He waited until the dance made him point the crossbow that was still in this hand at the barkeep and fired, hitting his arm and weakening the spell enough to free Vido and Iaghar, who rushed to his aid. The party nearly killed the barkeep and made him drop his wand, freeing the rest of the bar, before he disappeared. Around that time Lexter came to. It turns out the DM had been secretly passing notes to Lexter, Vido and Iaghar and they were in on this the entire time.\n\nAfter all that was over Coraim went and looked at the sign for the other tavern, it was called the Boar's Head, and he finished the fliers and hung them up around town. Then Lexter and Coraim began to notice magical energy around the tavern where the magical barkeep was, and then suddenly the entire tavern disappeared. As an act of propaganda for the revolution Coraim shouted \"this is an act of the King's magicians!\", while standing where the tavern was. Someone the party didn't know walked up and said \"no, this is no King's magician, this is the work of Eramil Sionndel, the notorious trickster\". The name sounded familiar, and Coraim recognized it as possibly being the name of a bard a tavernkeep in a town they had visited earlier in the campaign had mentioned as being the reason his tavern was going out of business. That was the end of that session. To be continued...\n\nAlso at one point Vido pissed on Lexter and Lexter retaliated by punching Vido in the balls but I can't for the life of me remember when exactly that happened, so I'm just including it as a footnote.",

        "text": "So let me tell the story of the best fight that I have ever been a part of in all of D&amp;D. This one will be a bit long. Homebrew world with greek gods and lots of racism. Party is Cleric of Nemesis (war domain also me), Incarnate ported from 3.5, Warlock with mind powers and a Blade Mage (homebrew class from online). \n\n**Background:** (this part is actually pretty cool)\nOur party is tasked with figuring out why, when a certain play is preformed, every player dies abruptly, with the four main characters dying most violently. So our party has the brilliant idea to volunteer to be preformers. The play was about our party’s jaunt through hell from a while back, the party has since shifted around but basically the warlock played himself and the incarnate played my late paladin while cleric and blade mage stayed with the audience. We were able to interview the only survivor of the play’s performance and she basically left us with a symbol that cleric was able to recognize as the crest of Cronos, the evil titan god of time. So we are operating under the impression that we are going to fight a god so w/e. \nTis the big night, full house and actors reaching their places. Performance goes as planned. Our actors roll performance to see how they do in this act. Performance goes as planned. Our actors roll performance to see how they do in this act. Performance goes as planned. Our actors roll performance to see how they do in this act….\n\nYep, time loop. Everything was repeating, only after the third try did one of us figure out that we have been playing the first act on repeat for the past hour. We try to go against the grain, tell guards to search the place for what might be influencing everything only to find two guards dead. At the point the first act would have ended one of our players feels something sharp dig into his neck. Then we prepare for act one. \n\nTwo or three repeats later we finally have players rolling high enough to wake up and the whole party sees what is going on, we gather the whole cast in a protective circle and ready to fight and stop whatever keeps putting our lives on repeat. That is I guess when it stopped fucking with us.\n\n**The actual Fight:**\nTime slows to a stop around us, only our party is still moving. We spy the creature in the light fixtures above us. Black body, dark cloak, massive scythe in one hand (the preferred weapon of Cronos). The creatures’ head darts around, flashing in each of our directions in less than a second before it projectile slashes one of us. At the end of round one the world around us shifts. A few seconds have passed in normal time, previously frozen people have moved and the creature pulls time stop. No KOs yet. Round two comes to an end and the world shifts again, the tent is gone, the people too, the city around us is burning but frozen in time. Round three the world shifts again, the city is back in one piece, no tent, the people are just walking about the square. Amid round 4 we notice the scorpion tail on the dark creature and put together who it is, one of the demons from our old jaunt in hell, one that we left on poor terms with. She was wielding the scythe of Cronos. After two rounds the city around us was gone, after two more the plants. At round 9 or so our arena moves back to what we later found to be the creation of our world. Surrounded by ethereal figures reaching at a glowing singularity in the center of the battlefield. Cleric pulls a guiding bolt, calling on the power of his goddess for his spells as usual, and one of the figures looks directly at him as he does (where, I wonder did the advantage for that roll come from??). The fight continues aggressively until we are pulled into a small town, populated by races we’ve never seen with a shrine to Pelor in the middle. It was here we finally felled the creature. We took water from the fountain shrine and destroyed the demon’s body. With some magic we buried the scythe for the night and took a rest before destroying it with the holy water as well. \n\nWe returned to our time at the moment we left, calming crowds and chasing down the patron who kept the play going despite all the deaths. \n\ntl’dr: my dm decided to get creative one day and my party fought a demon through time.\n",

        "text": "One of the reasons [our on-going vampire campaign](https://sfvampires.wordpress.com/) has worked so well for so long is because the nature of the game lends itself to a unique situation: that of taking historical figures, turning them into immortal vampires (or other things) and spinning them up to the present-day. Combine that with an accomplished GM who is also a historian and, well, as [our NPC list shows](https://sfvampires.wordpress.com/known-npcs/), things get a little academic in the best sorts of ways.\n\nAfter two years of playing the game, though, one of our players decided to join in on the historical fun when he next had to roll up a character. Given the option of drawing from any point in history, he went straight for the gold and chose a Caribbean pirate. Rather than the big-guns, though, he chose a lesser-known pirate, [Thomas Anstis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Anstis). Partly this was because it gave him more flexibility, but partly it was because the real Captain Anstis had a real feud with one Royal Admiral Johnathan Flowers, which we instantly headcanoned as being of a \"*[NEMESIS!!!](http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=327)*\" nature (and you're damn right the GM latched onto it as a plot point for the game as well ;) )\n\nIn the years this character has been played, there's been a lot of fun with him \"waking up\" in modern nights and having to deal with modern technology out of the blue. But strangely, we never latched into the real hilarity of his situation until recently, when [one of the other characters finally decided to show him Wikipedia](http://raptor.zombox.org/vampire_recordings/2015_12_10_Anstis_wikipedia.mp3).",

        "text": "This is a summary of a small one-off game between myself as DM with two *completely new* players. I apologize for the length, but I felt it was necessary to lend this a little narrative weight for a proper payoff, especially given I myself was in the dark for much of it.\n\n**Preamble**\n\nOur story takes place in a large city that is noted for having one of the best wizarding schools in the kingdom. However the monarchy had come to resent the political power wielded by the wizarding administration and wanted to (quietly) dig up some of the school’s secrets to use either as blackmail or reduce their standing in the public eye. This is where the player characters came in.\n\nThey found themselves in a tavern at noon being solicited by an agent of the king to infiltrate the secret vaults beneath the university library and steal anything that is simultaneously highly questionable and clearly connected to the university. They were given a detailed map of the university campus, and some basic information about the type of security measures in place. The campus is a veritable fortress in the heart of the city, being enclosed by 40 foot walls with regular patrols of guards inside, and extensive magical and non-magical security procedures across all access points. The players were given a large discretionary budget, but were told that any failure on their part would see the monarchy disavow any connection to the incident. \n\nAs soon as all of this was laid out, one of the characters studying the map seemed to think a while and then began making curious requests:\n\n* An extremely long rope of a very particular length that is magically resistant to heat\n* Several potions of healing in a bandolier\n* Heavy stone or counterweight\n* A live bat.\n* Climbing equipment with a helmet\n* Lightweight magical explosive device with a remote detonator (“Fantasy C4”)\n* Disassembled catapult\n\nThese provisions being arranged for, they leave to mingle in the tavern and locate a hapless dupe. They manage to find a naive and eager young man named Ed who is overwhelmed by their generosity with food, drink, and friendship, and he agrees to join them that evening for more of the same.\n\nIn the interim, still not telling me anything of their plans, they look into purchasing a home next to the wall in a very particular part of town. It’s a fairly ritzy area and many of the homes have courtyards. The players search the listings and speak to a sales agent to ask about homes in that area whose courtyards include personal water wells. As luck would have it, one such home is currently unoccupied and up for sale. As soon as they have its location they thank the agent for his time, say they’ll be back later, and then immediately break into said home in order to start setting up the ikea-like catapult components in the courtyard. Everything is (apparently) now in place for their infiltration that night, and I have no idea what they're intending.\n\n**The Setup**\n\nThey invite Ed to their “new house” that evening for a night of drunken revelry, claiming that they had just moved into the city. They avoid showing him the courtyard catapult and pretend to get equally drunk. Ed is plied with enough food and drink to keep him very jolly, while not having him pass out.\n\nSometime after midnight the players begin preparations. The sneakier of the two takes the climbing equipment (without helmet), the bat, and the lightweight explosive device with him and begins to scale the school walls. In the meantime the burlier character takes their drunken companion, says they’re going to play “dress up” and puts him in the bandolier of healing potions and the climbing helmet, as well as firmly tying the heat-resistant rope about his torso. He ties the other end of the rope to the counterweight and awaits a signal from his companion.\n\nThe plan starts to fall into place when I realize the district they wanted to purchase their home in is right alongside a small out-building within the walls of the school that is labelled “alchemical component storage” on their map. The sneaky character manages to scale the wall without too much difficulty and belay his way down onto the campus without being noticed. The storage building is nearby and he avoids a roving patrol of guards to break into it. He sets up his explosive device near some vats that have an alarming number of bolded caution signs. Detonator in hand, he exits the building and begins slinking along the campus in the general direction of the library.\n\n**Execution is Perfect**\n\nOnce he is far enough away, he uses the “animal messenger” spell to communicate to his partner via the bat that everything is in place. The partner in the house shows drunken Ed the courtyard catapult, and with a little cajoling gets him to sit in the cupola. With a final wave, he launches poor Edward through the night sky and over the schools walls.\n\nEdward flies through the air until the rope is pulled taught and he makes a bone-crunching impact in the middle of the main campus thoroughfare. This is about a hundred yards beyond the alchemical storage building. However between his helmet and the landing shattering every healing potion in his bandolier, Ed remains alive and conscious despite his terrifying experience. He starts screaming in pain and alarm, alerting every guard to his presence.\n\nAfter roughly twenty seconds of Ed lying on the ground screaming, as various patrols start to head towards his position, the player back in the house heaves the counterweight into the courtyard well.\nEd immediately starts getting pulled back towards the school walls from the direction he was launched. The guards see this screaming youth being inexplicably pulled along the ground and they begin trying to chase him down, worried he might be a student.\n\nIn the time it takes Ed to be dragged a hundred yards towards the wall his screaming calls almost every patrol on the campus towards his position. Eventually the counterweight hits the bottom of the well and Ed arrives at a final stop… right outside of the alchemical storage building.\n\nStill seriously injured and babbling in terror, Ed’s position has attracted almost two dozen guards, who arrive to congregate around his body and discuss what to do. The player inside the walls is observing from some bushes a healthy distance away. When he judges that enough patrols have assembled he sets of his detonator.\n\nAn enormous explosion of magical energy rips outwards from the storage building to engulf Ed and the guards, killing them instantly. It partially destroys the two nearest buildings, and causes a section of the outer wall to collapse. The player from the house swiftly enters the campus through this breach, meets up with his partner, and they calmly head towards the now unguarded library as they leave a miasma of death, carnage, and alarm bells behind them.\n\n**TL;DR: My players created a rube-Goldberg engine of destruction fuelled by sociopathy to blow up half a wizarding school.**\n\nEdit1: The original players have read this and reminded me of a key detail I forgot:\n\nIn addition to the other equipment they had requested, they also wanted a one-shot scroll that would create a relatively powerful self-sustaining illusion. Before firing the catapult the player in the house used this scroll to make it look like Ed was constantly running for the next minute.\n\nSo what the guards actually saw was a man screaming in pain and terror as he apparently ran around the campus. Hence him catching their attention so effectively...",

        "text": "This ramble comes from the second and third sessions, which are subsequently the last as of now, of the aforementioned party of the dwarf-to-elf spectrum.  These sessions should probably be considered one, as they were on the same day, just separated into two vaguely defined bits with a couple hours in between.  Anyway, the party as it stood was Berrik Yogisson the Dwarf Fighter, Varrag Leonasson the Half-Dwarf Cleric, Edgar Barnum the Human Bard, [Mikey] the Half-Elf Bard, and [Dylan] the Elven ~~Cultist~~ Evoker, along with a Guest Star Party Member, and an NPC/DMPC (The line's kinda fuzzy for where this guy fits in).  Respectively, they were an Elven Barbarian/Sorcerer whose player hadn't played since First Edition, who I shall call John, and a Half-Elven, Half-Dwarven Ranger/Barbarian, who shall be referred to as Nick.  If it isn't obvious, I am apparently incapable of remembering Elven names to any degree.\n\nAnyway, the party wakes up after being brutalized last night in this holy tavern, and find a random, very mangy-looking elf rummaging behind the counter for alcohol, bartender nowhere in sight.  After we all SPECTACULARLY fail to introduce ourselves, resulting in each of us being threatened with a very imposing (and probably magical) pole-arm, we eventually manage to have a semblance of a conversation.  After that particular fiasco (off to a great start), the DMPC/NPC/Quest-giver/Walking Shoutout showed up, and once again, we botched dialogue.  When your entire party consists of a gruff fighter, a very skittish cleric, two highly offensive and arguably insane bards, and a ~~cultist~~ reserved mage, conversation gets a little wonky.  Anywhoodles, we learn that this guy is pretty much a professional vampire hunter, and was sent by [insert plot here] to get us on our feet.  So, he tells us about this decrepit manor that has been generating reports of vampire activity.  We accept the quest, the sorcerer joins because he felt like it, and we were on our merry.\n\nAfter an uneventful trip, we arrive at le manor, which is practically crumbling on top of itself, and surrounded by a high stone wall.  We roll Perception, Investigation, all that jazz, but, as I will get to later, we made one major mistake that'll suck for us later.  Anyway, Berrik marches straight into the main courtyard, the ranger and spellcasters follow, who forces me to come too, and the bards check the perimeter.  After the dwarf utilizes his Stone Cunning on some statues and I continually prove myself and Varrag a wimp, some Skellingtons and two mummies bust out of one of the sides of the manor while I was fetching water.  \n\nThis segment consisted of the bards shooting arrows at the skellingtons (which did next to nothing), the dwarf being a dwarf, and getting some kills, the sorcerer giving absolutely no cares, the wizard buggering off along with the sorcerer, the ranger going ballistic on the Undead, and me finally proving useful with destructive Turn Undeads, and then revoking any value by hitting myself with my warhammer.  (I don't know why I tried.)  Anyway, after that was over with and pitiful rewards were reaped, we did what literally every group is warned not to do: we split the party.  Myself, Mikey, and the Ranger went into the wing where the skellingtons came from, the Spellslingers went into the main chamber, and Yogi and Booboo (the paired nickname for Berrik's and Edgar's players) went into the main entrance, and went immediately upstairs.  \n\nThis was the party's first taste of exploration, and I think that... well, at least we didn't immediately kill ourselves on whatever we found.  The Spellslingers ran into another pack of skellingtons, and Dylan discovered that he didn't have the resources to cast Fireball because he never gathered the materials.  So, they had a mix of stabbing things with polearms and casting weak spells.  At least they didn't die.  To stick with their story first, after they killed the pack of bones, they explored the throne room, where the sorcerer pried the rubies out of the eyes of the symbol of Dylan's cult (which just HAPPENED to be there for no reason whatsoever), they debated on the value of rotting tapestries, and then they explored the first floor's west wing.  Not much happened for them, besides the sorcerer scaring himself with a suit of armor he found in a dark room.\n\nNext in order of plot-relevance would be the Ranger's group.  Honestly, we didn't do much either.  We found a pack of skellingtons, who were standing perfectly still and guarding some coffins, and after ignoring them (not really even sneaking past them, just plain walking by), I looted weapons (earning the ire of those in the party who didn't think to look for those), and then we ended up on the wall segment.\n\nFinally, we end up in an important bit.  At some point, Dylan accompanies Yogi and Booboo, and they look into maybe a room before they find a cloaked figure chilling in one of them.  They pop in to say hi, and it does not go well.  After bombing introductions, they find out that this dude is probably a high-level necromancer, and follows a sister-cult of Dylan's.  Realistically, it would be more accurate to say that their gods were at a truce, maybe a very minor alliance, but the point stands.  They actually manage to recover the conversation a wee bit, until Dylan brings up the fact that we came with a vampire hunter, who turns out to be THE vampire hunter, and the one who slew his lich-liege.  Suddenly, things turned crappy when he essentially declares war.  I believe the dwarf readies his weapon, and then the bard shoots the necromancer with a light crossbow.  The necromancer saw the three damage, and raised it considerably in return, casting a high-level Cause Woulds, and almost killing our dear Bard #1.  The necromancer then triggers a spell, and the entire manor falls into pitch black, while the evil cleric swears his revenge, yadda yadda, and pulls an Elvis.  (...leaves the building.  Get it?  ...I'll shut up.)  This happened to have the convenient effect of causing literally all the problems.  I think our DM was just waiting for us to royally screw this up, and I think that we may have exceeded his expectations. \n\nThe gripping conclusion of The Hijinks of the Random Patrol to come at a later date.",

They live on the top of our tiny planet and control all our water. And now they've shut it off because they're whiny fucking babies and declaring war on anyone who criticizes them. Waaaaah. Fuck humans.\n\nBut coming to the rescue were four questionably-capable individuals, a sort of \"adventuring party\" in the same way that three snakes duct taped to the head of a dog is a \"hydra\". Up first is [Nibbit the murder dullahan](http://i.imgur.com/EyuHkT8.png) who, thanks to some interesting magical effects, has the highest AC of the party and also magnetically draws in attacks. Next is [Jello Shot, the slime of mass destruction](http://i.imgur.com/oNuhhTF.gif) who has taken the feat \"Weapon focus: Seige cannon\". After that is [Loki the half-elvish liar](http://i.imgur.com/LFK6CyZ.png), whose notable accomplishments include having more weapons than the rest of the party combined, and being a sleazy motherfucker. Finally, in the \"dog\" position of this hydra of failure, supporting the madness and keeping it reigned in without contributing too much, is [Ling Ling the monkey girl](http://i.imgur.com/2SwMf0l.png) who's kind of okay at bows and stuff, but is far better at hitting the party when they're acting stupid.\n\nSpeaking of acting stupid, the humans had shut off the water, but they hadn't considered where the water actually GOES when you shut it off. They were gathering it up from an enormous perpetual storm, it wasn't like they could just turn the faucet of. So all the water they didn't allow to flow down the sides of the planet was instead going directly into the ground. The nice, soft, spongy ground that all their houses were built on. As the architects and landowners sputtered in impotent rage, they failed to consider one other fact: Gravity. The water was being sucked down into the big network of tunnels and cave systems that make up every fantasy world ever, and were flowing down in a terrible cascade of property damage and freak drownings until it emerged from the bottom of the planet and fell off.\n\n&gt; LING LING: \"Well, how about we just, you know, CATCH the water? Like, with pipes and stuff. And fish all the dead bodies and silt out of it.\"\n\n&gt; EVERYONE ELSE: \"Because that would be crazy expensive?\"\n\n&gt; LING LING: \"Oh! How about we turn ourselves in to the humans for the absolutely massive bounty on our heads, use the money to build the pipes, then stage a daring escape?\"\n\nThe plan hit all the key points- who they would turn themselves over to, what their escape plan was, who would handle the money, and how awesome this was for all of the non-humans and how sucky it was for the humans. It was perfect. The party (escorted in by Villar, who was totally not Ling Ling's boyfriend) was handed over to a complete fucking ponce of a human officer, whom nobody would miss if someone just happened to, say, dissolve off all of his skin inside of a giant, murderous green slime. The ponce insisted that the party be thoroughly searched, and managed to retrieve all of Jello Shot's and Ling Ling's weapons. Loki, being a walking armory who constantly made lewd noises whenever the guards touched him, was slapped around a bit, given a cursory examination, and summarily kicked in the dick. Except that Nibbit's attack magnetism was up, so when the ponce let loose with the kick, he did not impact the feeble half-elvish nethers of Loki Moonshadow, squishy individual. No, the ponce's kick landed squarely in the groinplate of Nibbit, who was made of solid steel, weighed over 1000 pounds, and had just gotten a fresh Adamantine finish.\n\nWhen everyone in the general vicinity had finished laughing their asses off at their boss's spangly new dislocated ankle and crushed bones, they resumed the search, found an impressive assortment of knives on Loki, and when they couldn't actually manage to disarm nibbit, they called in some gunners and shot him to pieces. Nibbit played along, allowing his limbs and torso to be carted off, but since his head was a motherfucking cannonball, nobody particularly wanted to lift it and it was left on the ground. Also, in a key piece of oversight that would end up dooming the humans to a slow and terrible death, they had missed a critical detail: Loki Moonshadow had rammed a bottle of maple syrup up his ass.\n\nThe party was hauled off to big, decrepit prison that was as structurally unstable as it was waterlogged. Still, it was the best the humans could get on short notice, so the party was slapped inside while a larger force of armed escorts was called. Nibbit was divided into five components (minus the head), Ling Ling and Loki were put in cells with pretty good locks, and Jello Shot was forced into a big room with the entryway smeared with Alkali (anti-slime goo). But they'd not accounted for Nibbit's head, which, for spooky magical reasons, had a burrow speed. The severed head of Nibbit went to and fro between the cells, delivering the party's main armaments by way of the Bag Of Holding which he had rammed beneath his helmet for exactly this purpose. Loki and Jello Shot distracted the guards, and Nibbit found his breastplate and became a terrifying omnipresent hazard- individual guards would be tackled from behind and trapped under the stone as Nibbit worm-suplexed them into the ground. Loki busted open the locks on his cell, popped out Ling Ling, got Jello Shot out by abusing the bag of holding, and then started a cheerful murder-spree.\n\nOnly two guards survived the massacre, but one of the final runners managed to scream out to the perimeter guards that there was a prison break.\n\nAnd the full might of the human military, the strongest military force on the entire comet, began to swing around to bear on the party.\n\nThey were so totally and completely fucked it was actually sort of funny.\n\nThe first wave of completely normal guards came charging toward the prison in an attempt to zerg rush the party. Nibbit used a grease spell to slow them down, and then Jello Shot set the whole fucking entry hall on fire with a flaming cannonball. The humans retreated to consider their individual health plans, and then decided that, if the party wanted to stay locked in a shoddy stone death-trap surrounded by fire, well, they could damn well accommodate. The humans ringed in the jail with a circle of intense fire, and then they started sending in the Specialists.\n\nThe Specialists were human warriors of various different flavors- rogues, monks, necromancers, gunslingers, archers, etc. A few of them, such as the enemy rogues, were no trouble at all- Loki was incredibly paranoid and could outstealth their asses any day of the week. The fighters couldn't stand up to Jello Shot, his immunity to nonmagical swords, and his complete disregard for things like collateral damage. Nibbit served as a weirdly mobile mage-hunter, using his burrow speed to dart through walls and attack the cowardly casters where they thought they were safe. Ling Ling coordinated things while she desperately signaled to the rescue team to get the fuck out of there.\n\nAnd then the Pale Stranger got the drop on the party, and delivered a Full Attack into Nibbit's back. Six shots from powerful handguns reduced Nibbit from nearly full health to nearly dead in a single round, and even after the party rounded on him, he managed to make an escape. He kept harassing the party from around corners and over terrain, and with all of his shots magically finding themselves going after Nibbit, he hardly had to aim. And when Nibbit withdrew to save himself from the barrage, he was hit by a hellish knight with a flaming greatsword and sent into the negatives.\n\nThe party retaliated against the constant assault, felling or fending off most of their opponents. But there was a special place in their hearts for that bastard Pale Stranger, who they caught in the open, shot with acid arrows, pelted with bombs, stabbed, and threw down a well. With another bomb for good measure. He probably wouldn't be back, ever. Other amusing threats included a Barrier Mage who was specifically there to put a lockdown on Jello Shots cannon-firing spree, and accidentally redirected a cannonball down a hallway that just happened to contain his boss, the ponce with the broken foot. Whoops. But the humans were steadily advancing, grouping up, and pinning the party into a corner- the Barrier Mage locked off one of the two entrances with a Wall Of Force while a high-level monk ominously put on punching gloves covered with Alkali.\n\nAnd then Loki threw the bottle of syrup at them.\n\nIt broke all over their wall killing their visibility and ruining their heroic charge. The wall dropped, and the syrup splatted onto the floor. The advancing humans charged over, unheeding and fully intent on killing the party, when rescue arrived. An artillery barrage leveled a wall of the prison, knocking everyone on their ass, and a digging machine emerged from the wet soil underneath and popped open its hatch, unleashing a robotic guard dog that jumped to the party's defense. Rescue had arrived! And just as the barrier wizard prepared to seal off the party's escape with another wall of force, he slipped in the spilt syrup and got his long, wizardy robes and waving, luxurious hair glued to the floor by the humble puddle of sugary goo.\n\nThe escape into the digging machine was frantic and absurdly close. Jello Shot writhed in first, followed closely by Ling Ling. Loki remained outside, and Nibbit was barely dragging himself to the machine when a stray arrow caught him and knocked him out completely. One more hit and he would be dead for good. Loki ran to the rescue, using himself as a shield to protect Nibbit from the onslaught of arrows and bullets, and Nibbit was only rescued by the frantic scramble and an unlucky crit fail for the humans. The hatch slammed shut with the robot dog still outside, and the party made an extremely hasty retreat as they bandaged their wounds and got some well-deserved down-time.\n\nThey'd done it. The party had survived.\n\nLing Ling laughed in relief, Loki looked smug, Jello Shot did a strange woobly dance, and Nibbit groaned from his jumbled heap on the floor. Even the kobold machinist driving the digger got in on the celebration. They'd saved the world from its horrendous drought, stuck it to the humans in a thoroughly satisfying way, and everyone had gotten out alive. They were unstoppable!\n\n----\n\n*A hunched, wounded figure fell for what seemed like hours, and with a tremendous crash, impacted a vast underground lake...*\n\n*Ice began to cover the water in a slow, creeping tide.*",

        "text": "So I played maybe my second or third ever table top game at the time and I quickly found out I like playing evil characters. for this character i decided he liked to eat ears. There was me (a fighter), a rogue, a ranger and a mage. The DM starts the game out pretty normal, we're all sitting in a tavern and an NPC comes in (I forgot his name, so I'll call him Ned) asking for help. Turns out Ned is the own of a local tavern on an island who has been having some problems with disappearing residents. Everyone in the party was broke, so we figure why the hell not. \n\nOn the way to the destination we get ambushed by people trying to stop us. We beat them pretty easy but we learn there's also a bunch of intrigue going on that we'll have to dabble in as well. Being the insane cannibal that I am, I cut off all the ears of the dead NPCs that attacked us and save them for later in a little bag I carry around with me.\n\nFast forward to the far away land we're hired to save, we decide to split up, gather what information we can then meet back at Ned's tavern. I (of course) intimidate information out of people, the ranger asks politely around town, the mage stays at the tavern and the rouge decides to seduce and have sex with as many gossiping old women as possible... One of which, was Ned's wife.\n\nSo after we all meet back up at the tavern we find out our rogue is still busy. I think it's hilarious, Ranger has no opinion and mage gets pissed off at the rogue. Ned decides to come back to his tavern and we freak out that he's going to find his wife with the rogue. So the ranger gets a brilliant idea to lead him to the hay piles outside, knock him out and bury him in the hay pile, which of course we do. We cover the body then everyone but me heads back into the tavern. I just linger around for a few minutes.\n\nFew minutes later, I'm sitting at a table having a beer, and enjoying one of my delicious ears while the mage and rogue are fighting over the moral implications of sleeping with out hosts wife. The ranger, who never trusted me to begin with gets a strange feeling and decides to examine the ear I'm eating. Rolls a 20.\n\nDM.\"The ear looks oddly fresh and it still quite bloody.\"\n\nI smile.\n\nSo he pretty quickly figures out I chopped off Ned's ear and I'm eating it so he freaks out and tries to tackle me and take the ear away from me. I have the highest strength in the group so I roll to toss him off of me and succeed. I toss the ear aside and get ready for a brawl while the mage grabs the ear in hopes of re-attaching it to Ned. So me and the ranger are going at each other, rolling around on the floor, tossing each other aside, breaking pretty much every piece of furniture in the tavern. Ned's wife is freaking out, the rouge is sitting there laughing at us and the mage is trying to perform surgery.\n\nAfter a few more minutes we come to a truce when I have a sleeping spell cast on me, because I'm apparently the aggressor but whatever. Ned comes in, freaks out that his tavern is ruined and gets the guards to send us home. \n\nOn the way home, mage has a fit about how Ned was kind enough to let us stay at his tavern for free and in return we knocked him out, chopped off his ear, reattached a bloody stump to his head and slept with his wife and that we should feel ashamed of ourselves. I just feel slightly heavier with the 200 gold I got in my pocket as payment for eating his ear.",

        "text": "Some preface : I've been gaming online with a group of friends now for a few years. Counter Strike, ARMA, and other games. Recently they showed interest in getting a D&amp;D group started since they found out you can play online. They know I've played before and almost demanded that I play with them to be an experienced hand. They went on roll20 and posted looking for a DM willing to go with a group of 6 or 7 people. They found one. We started. \n\nMy character is Bill the Enchanter. A human Sorcerer with a criminal background who pulls cons on people using his cantrips. I like to challenge myself sometimes. And with this group i figured this would be fun. We all started level one and the DM opted for Curse of Strahd.id never played it before so I was open to it. Beforehand, however, I arranged with our DM that my character would privately make a coin flip before every fight to determine if I helped or not. He found it hilarious and allowed it. \n\nWe began Strahd and progressed through the story to the haunted house. I had to push a bit to move things along, being that new players wanted to explore everything and we were getting nowhere and finding nothing. \n\nOnce we begin our journey in the haunted house, things got real. There were multiple encounters through it, and more often than not somebody set off a trap or roused an enemy. My coin flips kept hitting 2's so I would ignore the fight with \"You've got this handled\" and use the time to explore the rooms and search for treasures, which I found. \n\nAt some point another character picks up on it, runs an investigation check on a room that appeared empty, and notices the spot on a dresser where I'd taken a jewelry box. Then they proceed to pretty much mug me. I give them the box, and three of the Rings from inside it. They immediately begin talking over each other, when I get a message from the DM saying that he's going to allow me to keep the 750gp necklace because they're arguing amongst themselves. \n\nWe get to the final section. There's an altar. The cult is demanding a sacrifice. They don't care who or what as long as it dies on the altar. Suddenly, everyone moves to another channel in the TeamSpeak we're using, leaving me alone with the DM. \"They're going to try and sacrifice me. I know it's coming. I'm going to go ahead and get ready so I have the advantage and I'm backing down the hallway so they have to funnel in to get me. And since I know the fight is coming, can I prep a bonus action? \" \n\nThe DM allows it, everyone comes back in, and sure enough they start coming for me. They line up down the hallway trying to rush me and overpower me. Now it's up to my rolls. The DM informs them that this has become an encounter and everyone rolls for initiative. Because I was prepared I get first roll. They're all lined up in the hallway, so I run to the front of their line and blast them with Thunderous Wave. For my attack roll I hit a 18+5. The three people it's hitting all fail their saving throws miserably against it and I roll 14 damage. Two of them die seeing as we're all level 2 and it flings all three of them back into the rest of the group. Since they're in a pile, I use my bonus action to scoot up to the pile and throw Burning Hands at them. I roll a natural 20, doubling the damage. Their disadvantage causes them to all fail their saving throws. For damage I roll an 11, resulting in burning all but one of them into nothingness. The last person has 1 he and the DM has proclaimed him to be knocked unconscious by the blast. \n\nI grab him by his singed clothing and drag him to the altar where I proceed to roll a 1d4 bludgeoning, and stomp on his neck. The dungeon is clear. I gather up all the valuable loot I can carry, go back to the inn, and challenge the barkers to game of chance. All of them are laughing hysterically at my last-man-standing victory. They don't even care that they have to start with new character sheets and I keep my sorcerer, now level 3.  \n\nProbably the most fun I've had playing in a long time. ",

        "text": "Hello again! This story is a continuation of 'The Bad, The Mad and the Outright Terrifying: A Super-Villain's story Part 2', which you can find here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4ghpgj/the_bad_the_mad_and_the_outright_terrifying_a/. Part two saw our crew of bad guys finally united thanks to the effort of Pinnacle, this world's Doctor Doom analogy. Each was taken from wherever they had been at the time of the Zel'tan invasion and brought to a remote island, complete with super-villain fortress and private mook army. It was here that Pinnacle offered the empowered criminals of Earth a choice: Eradicate the alien hordes assaulting their world and become humanity's new heroes! This is where we find ourselves currently.\n\nThe tropical island was a bustling hive of activity as men and women in matte black tactical gear prepared for an invasion. Their features obscured with gas-masks, these henchmen moved with a precision that would make even the most skilled soldiers blush. A fleet of vertical take-off and landing vehicles were going through their pre-flight checks while cutting edge weaponry was distributed among teams. Through it all, the motley gaggle of super-villains was being directed by Pinnacle himself.\n\n\"Transmat, you will act as transportation for Chierop and Brigadine. Join with task force nineteen, in hanger bay eight. The three of you are tasked with liberating Sydney, understood?\" The trio in question answered in the affirmative before stalking off to join their troops. Pinnacle turned to the next group, already barking orders. \"Kitsune, Barghast and Event Horizon; head to hanger bay eight and rendezvouz with task force seven. You will be re-taking New York.\" Minato frowned, his hand shooting into the air. Pinnacle raised an eyebrow imperiously before speaking. \"Yes, Kitsune?\" \n\n\"Hi, thanks, big fan. How exactly are the three of us supposed to take back New York? It was one the most heavily affected cities, wasn't it?\" Minato's tone was almost conversational if not for the severe frown on his face.\n\n\"It was. I would suggest re-taking Manhatten before moving on to the surrounding areas. Regardless of your choice, you will be facing significant opposition. Any other inquiries?\" Pinnacle spoke in a way that suggested that it would be prudent to not ask any more questions. Despite that, Minato continued to speak.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, yes. How is it that you expect the three of us and two dozen mercenaries to pull this off when the United States military was utterly ineffectual at doing the same thing?\" If Pinnacle was aggravated by Kitsune's insolence, he managed to conceal it masterfully. His words were carefully chosen, with a measured quality that put Minato on edge. \n\n\"I expect you to perform to the best of your abilities. I have taken into account each of your skills, your strengths and weaknesses. This team is optimized for reclaiming New York City from the Zel'tan. I do not doubt that oppurtunities will present themselves to you once there. You are dismissed.\" Pinnacle's tone brokered no further disobedience. He turned towards another group of super-villains, ending any potential conversation that might have occured. Minto scowled angrily before sighing. Event Horizon shrugged and clapped Kitsune on the shoulder before speeding away. Baron Rotezhan scoffed, striding off to join him. With little option left to him, Minato joined his new partners-in-crime by a state of the art military plane.\n\n\"Looks like we'll be working together.\" A gruff, slightly muffled voice called out as they arrived. Another of the gas-mask wearing soldiers came into view, his armor marked with a splash of red on his shoulders. \"Call me Sarge. I'm the head of task force seven. We're at your disposal.\" The man saluted once before entering the VTOL, marching up the lowered ramp. The trio of powered criminals looked at each other with some mild confusion before following suit. The vehicle was larger than they had anticipated, easily accomodating the two dozen armed mercenaries currently housed inside. Each of them was strapped into their seats, a slightly awkward sight considering the heavy duty body armor that they wore. Sarge waited until they were inside before speaking again. \"Alright, listen up. These are the supers assigned to us: Kitsune, Event Horizon and Barghast.\" Minato gave a small bow, Event Horizon waved lazily while Barghast nodded stiffly.\n\n\"The pleasure is ours, ladies and gentlemen.\" Kitsune was as smoooth as always, oozing charm as he spoke. \"Ready to save the world?\" There was an answering chorus of hoorahs from the troops, some of them serious and some of the sarcastic. Sarge nodded in approval before presenting each of the super-villains with a small ear-piece. He pantomimed putting it in their ear before strapping themselves in. There were some bewildered looks exchanged between them before Barghast made to speak. His question was lost as the engines roared to life, drowning everything else out with a wailing cry. Startled, the malefactors strapped themselves in and started adjusting their communicators. There was a faint screech of static before Sarge's voice filtered directly into their ears. \n\n\"Good to have you online. Sorry for the abrupt take-off; we received reports that the Zel'tan are discharging infantry into New York. Figured that we needed to utilise whatever advantage we have, while we still have it.\" Sarge, sitting near the pilot's chamber, pounded on the metal three times before settling in. \"Pilot! Double time!\" There was no acknowledgement save for a sudden burst of acceleration that would have thrown the crew off of their feet had they not been safely secured. The VTOL rocketed away from the hanger bay, awarding our potential saviours with a tantalizing glimpse of the gleaming island fortress rising up from the ocean before the cargo ramp closed with a hydraulic hiss. Kitsune exchanged a look with Barghast, both of them clearly uncomfortable with the current situation. On the other hand, Event Horizon was enjoying himself immensely; the intense velocity appealing to his speedster nature. \n\nSeconds turned to minutes as the soldiers continued double-checking their provisions and weaponry. There were thinly veiled insults and snarky comments traded between squad-mates, along with requests for more ammunition or greater provisions. As they drew nearer to New York, Kitsune spoke into the ear-piece. \n\n\"Sarge, any idea where exactly we're landing?\" Event Horizon paid the conversation little notice, enraptured by the pure speed of the vehicle. Barghast leaned forward, interested but trying not to appear too eager. Sarge shook his head, slamming his hand onto a button next to him. The VTOL's interior was suddenly brightly illuminate by a shimmering sapphire light as a holographic display appeared over the loading ramp. The projection coalesced into a bird's eye view of New York City, high-lighted by real-time tactical information. Once the image stabilised, Sarge began gesturing with a laser pointer.\n\n\"We have a few potential landing zones. As you can see here, the Zel'tan dominate the air-space around NYC. A few F-22's tried some strafing runs but they were destroyed before anything came of it.\" He flicked the green indicator across the map, indicating several hovering ships that spanned many city blocks. \"These are the motherships. Doesn't look like they have any real armaments but we've seen them deploy dozens of smaller vessels, most likely fighters of some kind.\" Minato winced once, rubbing his forehead in irriation. Barghast stared at the map intently, trying to divine some appropriate strategy from the chaos. Finally drawn out of his speed induced fugue, Event Horizon began to pay attention. \"It means that, in order to infiltrate the city...\" Barghast cut him off with a faint snarl.\n\n\"We will need to enter by sea. Otherwise the lizards will simply burn us out of the sky.\" Sarge nodded in agreement, bring the laser pointer up once more. Kitsune managed a vaugely surprised look at Rotezhan before looking back to the projection.\n\n\"You're not wrong. That's why we've chosen some prospective sites for a F.O.B. that are accessible by water.\" Kitsune frowned in confusion and opened his mouth to inquire but Sarge cut him off. \"Forward operating base. It'll be our headquarters, at least temporarily.\" Minato leaned back with a petulant pout, slightly nettled that he had been pre-empted. Sarge continued as if nothing had happened. \"We have the Museum of Natural History, the Edgewater Multiplex Cinemas or Mercy College. We've scoped out these locations as being both fortifiable and able to hide our forces.\" The mercenary leader gestured to each of the positions for a few seconds before turning the indicator across the map. \"Fort Hamilton was a prospective choice but the Zel'tan inflicted serious damage on the infrastructure there. We also don't want to step on any toes if the Army Garrison managed to survive the onslaught.\"  Event Horizon inspected the map closely before speaking, violating the sudden silence.\n\n\"Museum. That's my vote.\" The others turned to him, suprised by his quick answer. The man in question shrugged. \"Irving Farm's nearby. Man needs his coffee.\" Minato sighed loudly, rubbing his forehead, while Barghast made a noise of disgust. \"What? Like either of you have any tactical training! We're a pretty boy con-man, a cannibalistic aristocrat and a super-fast kleptomaniac. You wanted an answer and my answer is the Museum of Natural History.\" Event Horizon leaned back in his seat, crossing his arms with a huff. His fellows glanced around at each other before musing over the idea.\n\n\"The museum is a sturdy building. Multiple floors and a good amount of land around, thick with trees for cover.\" Barghast sucked air through his teeth with every pause. Kitsune hummed in agreement, taking stock of the surrounding area before speaking.\n\n\"True, true. There's also a lot of stores around and plenty of subway entrances if we need to head underground.\" The cerebral duo shared a look before nodding. \"The American Museum of Natural History it is. Hopefully, we'll find some survivors holed up inside.\" Minato smiled before double-taking at Barghast.\n\n\"I agree. That would be...delightful.\" The nobleman was salivating lightly, thin rivulets of saliva running down his chin. Rotezhan noticed Kitsune staring at him and quickly wiped his mouth clear with a sheepish smile. \"Allergies must be playing up.\" It was not the Baron's most well executed lie. Shaking his head, the medium turned to Sarge and spoke through the communicator.\n\n\"Sarge? Give the order.\" The armoured figure gave a quick salute and pounded on the door once more. He may have spoken but none of the others heard it. They may not have cared even if they had heard; each of them distracted with preparing themselves for what was to come. It took precious few minutes before the VTOL, flying low across the Hudson, began to approach the potential F.O.B. An unfamiliar voice rang out over the comm, full of sarcasm.\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, we are approaching our destination now. Please ensure that you collect all of your luggage, weaponry and in-flight snacks before you exit the flight.\" Sarge slammed a fist against the door frame with an irate growl.\n\n\"Pilot, stow that shit. What's our ETA?\" There was a sudden lurch in the vessel and a series of lights flashed red, accompanied by the hiss of the cargo ramp began to slowly descend. The troopers surged forward, bursting free from their safety harnesses and charging off of the now open platform. Rappel lines dropped from the vehicle as soldiers abseiled down into the well-groomed garden of the American Museum of Natural History. Cries of 'clear' rang through the ear-piece, the two squads reporting that the VTOL was good to land. Moments later, the dasterdly trio walked out of the vessel and into the sunlight. It had only been several hours since they had been in New York but the city was already drastically different. \n\nThere were no more lights in the city; the power grid having already been destroyed by the Zel'tan. Any fires that had once raged had either taken their toll or withered away, leaving burnt out husks of once proud skyscrapers. Clouds of thick, black smoke still polluted the air but they were now joined by concentrated beams of sunlight that punched through the smog. Several alien fighters shrieked through the air, resembling chitinous obsidian talons. Three large, spherical vessels floated menacingly over the city as they randomly disgorged more ground forces in spectacular flashes of light. The smell of burnt flesh wafted across the river, strong enough that even the non-enhanced could detect it. Minato shuddered at the sight, transfixed by the carnage before him. Barghast examined their surroundings with a critical eye, his stomach growling at the odor of meat.\n\nThe soldiers established a perimeter and were waiting for their orders when Event Horizon skid to a stop next to them. The speedster grinned at them cockily, hands on his hips.\n\n\"No-one inside. Checked all floors and the sub-basement. All ours.\" Kitsune face-palmed in exasperation but Barghast smiled darkly.\n\n\"Brilliant. I believe that we should head inside, yes? Sergeant, is there anyway that we can disguise our transportation?\" The man in question nodded and began to assist his coordinates in throwing a very large, camouflage tarp over the VTOL. They were joined by a man wearing similar armor to Sarge but with green across his shoulders. The man gave a mock salute as he walked over.\n\n\"Howdy folks. We are a-okay for touchdown and clear of Zel'tan contact for now. Let's bust out the barbecue and roast some burgers.\" Sarge slapped him across the helmet but the soldier seemed unfazed. \"Name's Pilot. As it might suggest, I can drive, fly or sail anything. You want something moved, I'm your guy.\" Minato grinned, about to make a particularly clever innuendo, when Barghast barked.\n\n\"We should get inside. Sergeant, see if you can find a generator to power this building. Squad A, start closing up all doors and windows, we don't wish to inform anyone that we have taken up residence here. Squad B, establish a perimeter around the museum and reconnoitre the surrounding area.\" The troopers saluted and began to busy themselves with the tasks assigned to them. Minato whistled, impressed, before throwing an arm around Pilot's shoulders. \n\n\"Between you and I, what do you think the odds of this little venture succeeding are?\" Kitsune's words were almost conspiratorial. Pilot shrugged, fidgeting with his side-arm and combat knife. \n\n\"Somewhere between zero and nil. Thankfully, I'm not paid to worry about that. We have a mission to complete, so we'll complete the mission.\" There was a simple certainty in his voice that threw Minato for a loop. Event Horizon had already vanished, intent on acquiring some roasted coffee while it was still potentially warm. Pilot marched inside the museum, muttering something about vantage points, leaving Kitsune standing in a grove of trees. The con-man smiled bitter-sweetly at the situation, glancing between the war-torn city and the temporary shelter they were combing through.\n\n\"Well then, I guess it's time to save the world.\"",

        "text": "So, a group of new and mostly new players were scooped up into an adventure with an experienced DM.  All told, there were five players: A Neutral Good Dwarf Fighter named Berrik Yogisson, a Lawful Good Half-Dwarf Cleric named Varrag Leonasson, a True Neutral Human Bard named Edgar Barnum (Named after Edgar Allen Poe and Barnum and Bailey's Circus, which pretty much sums up his player), a Chaotic Good Half-Elf whose name nobody could remember, and a Chaotic Neutral (Leaning to Evil) Elven Evoker whose name nobody could remember (Aren't Elven names fun?).  I played the misbegotten Half-Dwarf, and was the only player with basic knowledge of the game.  \nSo, in the beginning, after a basic introduction to the city we were in, and the divine tavern in which we were all conveniently holed up in, this ragtag bunch of players were in the game.  Berrik was chilling at one of the tables, keeping an eye on the elves, I was talking about my homebrewed goddess to a lovely older couple at one of the tables, Edgar was cracking jokes to the crowd (which was his own special breed of Bard-ness), the other bard, henceforth known as Mikey, was getting ready to steal the show, and the evoker, henceforth known as Dylan, was shivering by the fireplace for plot-reasons.  \nNot much happened at first, besides Mikey stealing the show from Edgar with a crit, and Edgar snatching it snatching it back with another absurdly high roll.  This prompted Mikey to leave in a huff, and see two mysterious people sitting at the bar, covered in divine symbols: an elf and a dwarf.  Mikey proceeds to stroll up to them, and ask if he could buy them a drink.  The elf turns to him, and says, \"Thank you, but you're money's no good here.\"  Now, one of the house rules was that everything said was in character unless otherwise noted.  This led to the rather entertaining running gag of Mikey the bard having an AWOL filter and saying horrible, horrible things all the time.  So, his reply, \"The F*** it is, I bought a beer ten minutes ago!\" came naturally and immediately.  After a laugh around the table, the elven ranger backhanded Mikey prone and to half health.  \nWe were all level 5.\nNow that we accidentally kicked off the plot, I rush up to heal him, and almost get shanked myself.  This occurrence leads our infamous jester to start cracking jokes, and then get shot at by the ranger to near death.  Forgive me for not remembering, but at this point, the fighter and the wizard got roped in too, somehow, and we all got thrown out back by the two mysterious figures.  I threw around some heals (not nearly quick enough for Edgar, spawning the repeating event of him complaining for not being healed immediately.  I think he expected me to teleport or something), and the party introduced itself to itself.\nAfter some awkward introductions and a hearty exchange of dwarf-vs-elf racism, the dwarf and elf came back, and our first encounter started: the barely-functioning, newly-formed party versus two crazily high-level NPCs.  (We later learned that the dwarf was an avatar of the resident overdeity, so that was fun.)  This was our first combat experience, and lessons were learned.  First was that the bards had no clue what they were doing.  The second is that Dylan was far too used to playing melee classes, and almost died.  Third is that Varrag had no clue how to use a hammer, which would continue for the rest of the game.\nSo, after we failed pitifully for a time, the ranger started taunting our dear old Berrik, and thus initiated a one-on-one fight between a fighter with no combat experience IRL, and what amounts to the Hand of God with a bow and twin short-swords.  It did not go well.  Berrik hit him once for what was marginally better than scratch damage, then was OHKOed in return.  God then immediately resurrected him, I poked fun at him, we got called out on our ineptitude, and we were told our first quest would start in the morning.\nSo, that was our first session.  All told... it could've been worse.",

        "text": "Back in around 2006, when I was a kid, I used to love playing Star Wars: Jedi Knight Jedi Academy on the Xbox, even though I was trash at it.\n\nI used to think I had to attack at the right time to deflect blaster bolts, and elected to use the E-11 and bowcaster over the lightsaber, even against dark Jedi.\n\nI found some... less than insightful ways around puzzles - at one point, where I was supposed to shoot a coolant pipe to cool some lava down to walkable temperature, I just used Force Speed to run past instead, taking substantial damage. I did manage to find some secrets by myself, though.\n\nBut sometimes, you get stuck.\n\nThere's a point in Act 2 where you have to rescue some prisoners while avoiding a Rancor. Now, I was not the bravest of kids back then. As soon as I saw the Rancor, I backed off and hoped it would go away. It didn't, because AI, and I managed to lead it over to the doorway before the area I was supposed to be in. I didn't know what to do. I didn't even want to approach it. I was scared. I thought it was going to eat me and instakill. I tried again but it ended the same way. That's when I gave up on that level and just skipped it. (RIP that one force point.)\n\nA few months ago, I picked up Jedi Academy again on Steam, in a bundle containing all the Kyle Katarn games. I made my way back through the game, much more quickly this time, with my skills refined over 10 years. I remembered how the levels were laid out, where the secrets where, and this time I had a better understanding of what to do. \n\nSoon I made my way up to the Rancor mission again. This time, there was no fear. I ran in, led and misled the Rancor around the area, and saved all the prisoners, but not before slaying the Rancor itself with very skillful usage of the lightsaber (read: spamming lightsaber throw while out of range). \n\nAlas: there was no reward for doing so, no Steam achievement or anything. But I don't need a popup to know I did something to be proud of. \n\nThe feeling of strength and relief after finally having beaten a great obstacle from my childhood was good enough.",

        "text": "Back again with another three sessions worth of what's happened. Thanks again to  /u/csubakkaa for helping with the spellchecking and proof reading.\n\nThe cast as follows:\n\n* DM: /u/Owler_DND\n* Enialis: /u/csubakkaa (Cleric)\n* Theresia: /u/sleepyhun (Warlock)\n* Velis: /u/naszerinted (Rogue)\n* Smough: /u/Canwebeday (Fighter)\n* Argyus: /u/lunchboxx1090 (Paladin) (yours truly)\n* Wilfred: /u/TheFireTrucker (Wizard)\n\n***Part 6: Preparations***\nThe party moved along the countryside towards the town of Alundal. Alundal is a mostly quiet town, out of the way enough that it would be a safe spot from the war. The party rested at the Staggering Pony inn. Enialis spoke with the mayor, warning him of the upcoming threats that might hit the town eventually, and asked the mayor to forget about the party ever being in the town. Theresia and Velis spoke with the merchants guild representative named Rufus, trading the copper they got from Harlore for money and food. Smough and Argyus went to a blacksmith and while Argyus bought a variety of weapons, they learned that there is a blacksmith in Ludok who was his cousin. If they mention Gareth they'll get a good deal on a new set of armor. In the evening Argyus met a former mercenary named Roland who was a member of the Ruby Dragons, a band of mercenaries that Argyus was part of before he became a captain in the Darthasian army. Roland told him that the last stop before the Wildlands is the Wistern Farm a nice and friendly bunch of people who helps travelers.\n\nThe next day Argyus began training Alaina at her request. In the training, Alaina managed to injure Argyus with a well placed stab from a shortsword. Fortunately, he was able to heal his wounds, so they didn't leave lasting damage.\n\nWhile they were travelling, a group of perytons attacked the group, but they were eventually slain.\n\nAs they followed the trail they found the farm invaded, and the farmers dead. Two ogres and an owlbear attacked the party. The fight was fierce but the party managed to survive. As they were inspecting the farm, two more ogres attacked them, now with a pack of wolves. The party overcame this, as Wilfred was chased by the wolves and Velis was badly injured. The party found a Driftglobe and a few scrolls in the house. After they took a breather, they decided to bury the dead.\n\n***Part 7: Into the Wildlands***\nThe rainy weather started to worsen as the party rested in the farm. Theresia saw the shadowy woman once again, but this time it wasn't in a dream but outside the farm. She went out, and after a brief discussion the woman vanished as did several of the bodies of the dead farmers, and two of the ogres.\n\nThe party continued with their travels into the wildlands, for it was the only way to the city of Ludok. The weather got progressively worse and they saw basically nothing from the heavy rain. Suddenly one of their horses was crushed by a boulder. A hill giant emerged with three dire wolves. They used their gem of elemental summoning to help against in the fight, and even Alaina helped them dealing with the wolves with a really good crossbow shot. As they emerged victorious from the fight, they spotted a temple in the distance. They inspected it to find shelter. It was an old Velcastran temple of the Great Wyrm. As they entered they were attacked by a pair of manticores. Magic ceased to work inside, because a gem embedded in a statue blocked all kinds of magic. When they defeated the beasts they ventured deeper, leaving the earth elemental with Alaina. Deeper inside, they found a horde of gnolls and hyenas. During the fight Enialis' left leg became severely damaged by arrows, making him limp permanently. After the fought off the gnolls, they found an egg of unknown origin.\nIn an other room they found a rod of pact keeper, some scrolls, and several healing potions. Smough set off a trap, animating skeletons all around them. They found a dead wizard's spellbook, and a wand of magic missiles.\n\nAfter a short rest they continued scouting the temple, now going into the last chamber. As they entered, Velis tried to sneak around, but the inside gnolls spotted him. Apart from the regular ones, there was a huge gnoll with a large axe, and another one with a box who was jumping from pillar to pillar. After a tough fight they took a breather and counted the spoils they found in the battle. They found a magical axe, a cloak of protection, a pair of boots of striding and springing, and a bracers of archery.\n\nArgyus, Enialis and Smough inspected the wall just opposite to the corridor. There was glowing runes on it, which were constantly shifting between different languages. Enialis touched the runes, and turned into a snake for one hour. They decided to stay there for the night.\n\nIn the middle of the night Enialis woke up to a noise. He tried to wake the others with no avail. He followed the noise into a corridor what weren't there before. The noise turned out to be laughter, coming from an 8ft tall red skinned man, with bright white hair and glowing golden eyes. He wore an unnaturally large grin on his face. Ha called out to the cleric:\n- Come in friend.\n\n***Part 8: Higher powers***\nThe figure introduced himself as Luron, the Prince of Serpents, and as Enialis' friend. The cleric remembered him as one of the Darthasian gods. Luron was the God of Trickery and the God of Autumn. During the conversation Enialis convinced Luron to tell him the location of the Asharnian army. Luron said that the army is headed south, then east, then east, and then south. Next, Enialis asked if Luron could heal his crippled left leg. Luron said that he can \"help him walk around\". In exchange he asked him to take a sphere Luron produced and not to take it under any circumstances to the temple in the ruin city of Baltreen which is in Gestera. The cleric agreed to this, and an emblem of Luron appeared on his left hand, which was an eye with a snake coiling in the place of the iris.\nEnialis then asked the god if he knew of the swords they've seen in the vision. Luron grew impatient and said that he's not the god of knowledge, he is in Asharn.\nHis next question was if Luron knew a giant wolf made out of fire. Luron said that he only knows the Mother Wolf Veyla and the son Vaashgryr. He also stated that he only likes fun things and they are not as fun as Ovena, The Goddess of Storms. Luron then went back on his the comment that he knew many magic swords and how wonderful they are. Enialis asked if the party would find the blades, for they will be able to do fun things with them, Luron answered with a maybe. As the cleric was about to leave, Luron whispered something into his ear.\n\nEnialis then woke up, which is strange for an elf. He found out that his foot was still injured, but there was a walking stick beside him. When he checked his hand, Luron's emblem was still on it.\n\nThe party gathered up their supplies, and left one of the carts behind moving all their belongings to the other. They were travelling for a whole day and night without any incident and used this time to properly recover from their wounds.\nThe following day Argyus was suddenly struck by an arrow, and the party was stopped by a group of hobgoblins. Their leader introduced himself as Akail, and told them to hand over any valuables as they were entering the territory of the Red Blade. As Argyus was trying to talk them out from the trouble, Smough took out a manticore head he took as a trophy and threw it in front of Akail. His guards took a step back. As Smough saw that, he pulled out the two owlbear heads, and took them in front of him as well. Akail challenged Smough to a single combat. All his guards and hiding goblins back away.\nThe executioner took the initiative, and with his first strike he critically wounded the hobgoblin. Barely standing, the captain tried to attack, but Smough countered with a riposte, taking his head. The fight ended in less than six seconds. All the hobgoblins and goblins stood in horror, then quickly fled. The party moved on peacefully, and without further interruptions.\n\nA few hours later they noticed a black mass moving towards them in the distance. As it got closer they realized that it's a large group of people in black robes. One of them stepped out and addressed the party. He spoke politely and asked if the group would rest at their camp. He offered the name of Meron so that they could call him by a name, even though he said he had none. He explained that they are the Brotherhood of the Talon, and they are followers of Meros, The darthasian God of Death, God of Winter and the Long Night, also known as the Vulture King. The party ate some rather bland soup, then Velis and Argyus trained Alaina in the arts of combat. Meanwhile that Enialis spoke with Meron and asked if he knew of the war. He said that he is aware of it. He also noted that the Bortherhood are merely walking through the wildlands. The cleric also asked him about his opinion on Luron. He said that he does not trust the Serpent Prince, because he was created by Meros but he betrayed him. He also said that he trusts Elera, the beloved of Meros, and thus trusts enialis. After their talk, Meron walked to Theresia.\n\nMeron told her that death followed her and that the darkness that's following her was getting close. They warned her to get ready because soon she might need to deal with that darkness.\n\nAfter the night's sleep the party moved onward, parting ways with the Brotherhood. After some time, they found a place where the ground was glowing. They saw the figure Theresia was seeing in her dreams. It shrieked out angrily at her, saying that she was not worthy of the power the figure was told to give to her. As she said that, several creatures erupted from the ground. It was the missing farmers' and ogres' corpses, made into undeads. Battle ensued. The party got injured, but they came out victorious from the encounter. Even the princess managed to finish off one of the zombies. As the dust settled, the hooded woman burstd into green flames. She quickly grabbed Theresia and pinned her to a rock, saying:\n- \"You will be nothing but a puppet. He sits on a silver throne. You'll be his puppet\" At this point, she collapsed into a pile of ash. With the help of Wilfred, Theresia managed to recall that the silver throne refers to the legend of King Adelbert, the first king of Gestera, also known as Adelbert the Mad. He's known as a powerful mage in his lifetime.\nSearching through the remains they found a pouch containing a silver necklace with a possibly jade pendant engraved with the words \"for Aela\", and 100 Gesteran Tahler.\nThe next morning they saw smoke in the distance. Turned out it was coming from the chimneys of Ludok. The party reached their destination. It took them 28 days to reach Ludok from the capital. It is the 27th of summerfall, the war has been raging for 37 days.....\n\nTO BE CONTINUED",

        "text": "Hey there, everybody! You may remember me [from my good friend's old campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/search?q=author%3AEgo_Dominus&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on), but with that being over, and us being at college, I decided to start up my own group in a completely homebrewed setting, as well as a system that is somewhere between D&amp;D and Deadlands Classic.\n\nNow this game will have a lot of similarities to that old one in terms of style, though I do hope to have a *slightly* more serious tone. As such, I wouldn't expect to laugh as much at my stories, but hopefully you'll still enjoy 'em.\n\nTime for our cast:\n\n**Nosdar**, a Dwarven noble with a gambling problem. Lost his father's axe in a bet and was forced to shave off his beard, signifying exile.\n\n**Tem**, a Goliath fence, played by none other than [my good friend JD.](https://i.imgur.com/DGeXclH.jpg) He has a revolver and a tower-shield.\n\n**Garnet**, a Tiefling thief who has worked with Tem in the past.\n\n**Deadalus**, a Tiefling paladin-in-training of Pelor. A little hot-headed.\n\nand **Solaire of Astora**, a full-blown paladin to Pelor, played by [Wade.](https://i.imgur.com/DGeXclH.jpg)\n\nThere were some sessions that happened between the story, but those weren't so great, so I'll focus on the main plot for now. On to the story!\n\nOur heroes arrive in the city of Hearthholme, a large wall originally designed to be a fortress, however during the half-century or so of peace that the continent has had, there hasn't been much need for a citadel, but people always need to live somewhere. As they approach the main gate, they are asked if they are with the mercenaries that the Heim had sent out on a mission. They respond that they aren't, but that they are adventurers. The gatekeeper tells them that the Heim will want to speak with them, and sends them off toward the palace.\n\nWhen the group enters, Heim Owen Ivo, a human, despite his Dwarven title and position, greets them warmly and informs them that, as much as he doesn't want to, he must ask a favor of them. You see, recently, a small treasure chest had been stolen from him, and he needs it back. The players agree, having nothing better to do, and the Heim instructs them that they should under **no circumstances** open the chest.\n\nYou can guess how well that turns out.\n\nThe players make their way into the mountains where the mercenaries seemed to have tracked the thief, and along the way, they are attacked by a large brown bear. Combat doesn't last too long, though, and when the heroes have dispatched with the threat, Nosdar decides he wants to take the bear's claws. After cutting them off, the others decide to take the rest of the bear, and settle on Solaire and Tem carrying it together.\n\nThey finally make it to their destination, a cave northeast of the city, only to find several people wearing the armor of the Brynn and Garrett mercenary company, all slaughtered, as well as one person who is not wearing the armor. Moving carefully through the cave, they eventually come to a large room in the cave with a bonfire in the center. In each of the rooms corners are unlit torches, as well as the Dwarven runes for the seasons.\n\nA quick Dwarven history check lets the players know that Dwarven culture believes that Autumn was the first season, and bip-bam-boom, they light the torches in the right order.\n\nTo both their left and right, small secret doors open, revealing a torch to the right, and a small chest to the left. The torch on the left, they discover, is an ever-burning torch, always producing light, but without the other properties of fire. The players that went to the the chest begin arguing when Nosdar's player tells me \"I open the chest!\" After the arguing goes on for a bit, I have them both roll quickness to see if Deadalus was fast enough to stop him, and he fails. Nosdar opens the chest revealing only a small note on the bottom.\n\n\"Beat you to it!\n-The Piper\"\n\n\nThat's it for this story, but there'll be more to come soon. I'm almost out for the summer, so we've only done this one plot arc, and we're waiting until next semester to continue, we may have some one-offs that we post up here later. But there's still a part 2 to this, so I'll see you there!",

        "text": "Warning: language, also kind of long.\n\nLet me tell you about one the best sessions I ever had the immense privilege to be part of.\nIt was a relatively simple mission set in a homebrew equivalent of Central/Eastern Europe. There's a war between the pseudo-Roman empire and the Elves to the north, with Transmontania stuck in the middle.\n\nThe campaign has been structured more like a series of one-shots, with returning characters gaining levels at the end of the session. We've already lost a few good people, including useless henchmen and mercs and a ninja. At this point, we were all level 4. There was my character, Niels the Human Paladin of Justice and Hard Choices (based on a super cool greentext I read last week), Wawick the Gnome Druid (the longest surviving character in the party), and Silas Brennon, elder brother of a local Baron and Battlemaster (and very different from a character I've described here before). We were accompanied by Paladin Pat, a kind of stupid Paladin of a local order. We can't really explain how he is still alive. All the other DMPCs die during the first encounter. I suspect divine providence.\n\nWe were resting from our previous adventure (involving devious homebrew creatures known as lurkers; fire was involved) when Silas came knocking, looking for adventurers that were interested in finding some mercenary company that was sent into the mountains and never came back. Wawick and I agree on the price (not a lot, but we were bored, and the economy in Transmontania is kind of shit) and we set off with Paladin Pat and Silas.\n\nWe first arrive at a small farming village. They are afraid of...something in the woods, but no-one tells us anything of worth, so we move on to the next. We find the next village in ruins:  corpses strewn about, farming equipment taken, blacksmithing and other crafting gear missing as well. No sign of the mercs we were sent to find, but we do notice that come of the corpses aren't fully divested of their wealth: gold and such still remained on their unperson, which indicated that this was not the work of typical bandits.\n\nSo we traveled on, into the mountains.\n\nSoon, we came upon a box canyon, which Silas notes would be a great spot for an ambush. We send Wawick up to the high ground while Silas, Pat, and I continued on the canyon floor. Wawick sees a goblin on some sort of wolfhound-like mount. The goblin espies Wawick and sounds the alarm, sending rocks down into the canyon to a) crush us and b) trap us (assuming a doesn't succeed). Silas and I successfully dodge the tumbling boulders, but Pat ends up just a little buried by them. He is, apparently, fine.\n\nAfter clambering over the boulders and after Wawick spiderclimbs down (sending shudders down everyone's back - shit's weird, yo), we see a line of mercs - about five - fending off a small army of goblins. We join the battle, making quick work of the goblins. At least, before the orcs goading them on start throwing crazy-eyed goblins (literally *throwing* and *crazy-eyed*) at us. They, too, go down quickly, but not before setting themselves on fire and burning down the barricade between us and the orcs. The orcs retreat and we catch our breaths.\n\nWe meet the mercs: Sturge, Thallia, Veselius, Thorea, and Ragnar. Turns out they are the last able-bodied warriors of the hundred-man company sent into the mountains (and they aren't terribly important AFAIK). Everyone else is either dead or grievously wounded - and not just physically. Those goblins ain't strong. These mercs are sheepishly licking wounds, and those too tired or broken to do so, I give them last rites and send them on their way. Yeah, Niels is a cold-hearted bastard.\n\nThe remaining mercs charge us with investigating some of the tunnels that dot the cliffside and find out where these orcs and goblins are coming from while they carry out an evacuation.  While looking into the largest of the tunnels, we see that the mercs had been collapsing tunnels so that ore orcs and shit could some bubbling out to ruin their evening. Good on ya, mercs.\n\nInvestigating another tunnels we find ancient inscriptions in what turned out to be either ancient Elvish or ancient Orcish. Either way, we find a journal written in Elvish detailing how the elves created the orcs and goblins as labor forces. No word on what happened between then and now, really. So we continue on, fighting the odd orcish band of warriors (including some that were apparently playing Humans and Houses) before we arrive in some sort of huge laboratory, wherein a bunch of goblins were mixing some variety of combat drugs (spelled, in typical idiot orc fashion: droogs. I'm sure there's a \"Clockwork Orange' joke in there somewhere). After acing charisma checks (our DM treats nat 20s on skill/attribute checks as critical successes, because we're rebels), we somehow convinced the goblins and orcs in the room that we were friendly. This is where things get really interesting. There were three doors out of the room: forward, and on either side. So we did the only logical thing:  we split the fucking party.\n\nSilas goes left. There's a long hallway, and at the end there are cries of battle and clashing swords. Silas enters the room at the far end and finds a large amount of orcs duking it out and betting on the winner. Wooden swords, for safety. Spying Silas, they quiet, eying him up and down. Silas approaches the largest of the orcs, an enormous specimen by the name of Urgnok, and challenges him to battle - one on one, any weapons. The orcs circle around as the two engage in a duel - quite possibly to the death...\n\nI (Niels) go right, and find a group of goblins moving around crates full of alleged ingredients for the combat droogs. I convince a goblin my the name of Mormald Drumpf that I am some sort of security auditor hired by their Elven master. Yes, there is some sort of elven fuckery on about here, so I dig for good old information. Turns out the elves were lead by some Wizard cast out by his people for some inequity or another. He convinces the goblins and orcs that they were the original intelligent life on the planet, and that long ago the human cast them into the depths of the world, and that the orcs and goblins are destined to take their rightful place at the apex of society. In short: Make Goblins Great Again. Morvald tells me about the so-called super-orcs, bred from enchanted essence of orcs in vats. I fetch Paladin Pat, who tells this uncommonly intelligent goblin of their true origins: oppressed laborers. Proletariats, if you will...\n\nWawick sallies forth through the remaining door and finds vat after vat full or baby super-orc, as well as a retinue of regular orcs guarding their supposed leader: the Elven Wizard, He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named-Because-the GM-is-Lazy. The doors slam shut behind her as the Wizard casts Cloud of Poison...\n\nSilas emerges victorious from the fray, turning to the kneeling Urgnok and proclaiming \"I AM THE BATTLE-LORD.\" An elven guard enters the room, complaining about how the orcs were told not to bet on the practice fights, but stops short when he sees Silas, covered in orc-blood with the orcs in the room bowing in respect. Silas turns towards the elf and charges as the orcs close in behind the elf, blocking any chance of escape...\n\nI (Niels) tell convince Mormald of how the elves lied. Mormald, incensed over this betrayal, gathers his comrades, and we train for the coming revolution. When training is finished, I stand before my brand-new workers' vanguard and say: \"My friends! You noble goblins! Rise up against your oppressors the elves, they who have lied in order to use you. Rise up in the name of your forefathers who were driven before the lash into labor and eventually death, for your brothers and sisters who slave away to this day under the heel of elven oppression! Rise up, my friends, for yourselves! Cast off these shackles of inequity and take your rightful place on the surface! But first: rise up against the elves here who have conscripted you into service, and cut them down. No mercy!\"\n\nWawick casts invisibility on hersefl and cuts open every single super-orc embryo, effectively aborting them as the Wizard's orc guards succumb to poisonous vapors. Wawick, too, falls to the cloud.\n\nSilas strikes down the elf with vigor and bloodlust. The orcs cry out: \"BATTLE-LORD! BATTLE-LORD! BATTLE-LORD!\" Silas quiets his new-found friends and says \" WE. ARE. BATTLE-LORDS!\" and charges back the way he came, out into the lab, his orcs following behind.\n\nI sally forth with my vanguard of goblin revolutionaries, intent on overthrowing their elven oppressors. We enter the lab as Silas and his small army enter on the other side. We eye each other for a moment before we turn towards the other door, the one Wawick entered. It's time.\n\nWe go in, and find aborted super-orc monstrosities littering the floor, with normal orcs crumpled up near the door. The Wizard had left his guards to die. We find Wawick curled up in the middle of the room, having finally succumbed to the poison gas. I giver her last rites as Urgnok takes her in his arms and lifts her above his head, yelling \"BATTLE-LORD! BATTLE-LORD! BATTLE-LORD!\" with the other orcs taking up the cry. (Wawick's player actually started crying here. She was pretty proud of having a character last that long in an otherwise unforgiving campaign, and this was a great way to send her off. She;s already rolled up a new(ish) character - an elf.)\n\nWe go through the doors at the far end of the hall and enter what appears to be the Wizard's throne room. Before us stands a squad of super-orcs, ten strong. They are outfitted with spears and shields, and are supremely trained. They snap into formation. Our orcs - numbering fifteen - charge the line, Urgnok and Silas leading the charge. They are effectively torn apart by the well-trained super-orcs, but not before my goblins scamper under foot and hamstring the super-orcs. Paladin Pat (proving useful for a change) assaults the Wizard who bursts into smoke (not poisonous this time, thankfully) and disappears. The battle continues. I get knocked over, and as a super-orc prepares to put me out of my misery, Morvald jumps on his backing screaming \"I GOT CRAZY DROOGS\" and gouges out the super-orc's eyes and eats its face. I've never been prouder. Silas and Urgnok cut down their fair share of super-orcs, proving their titles of BATTLE-LORD.\n\nThe smoke clears, and reveals the carnage: orc and goblin parts alike are strewn about the throne room, but thankfully no more super-orcs are left standing. The regular orcs are reduced by about half, and the goblins suffer heavy losses, but the day is ours - this side of the battle at least. We find a hidden escape tunnel utilized by the wizard, and we follow it down. It leads out into the canyon.\n\nWe waste no time. The orcs and goblins gather around to see their revolutionary savior and their BATTLE-LORD put down their elven oppressor. We did not disappoint. One of the elven guards is dispatched with, well, dispatch. The wizard goes down next. The remaining elven guard falls to his knees and begs for mercy. He receives none.\n\nWe return to town, our allies in tow. The orcs attain positions in the Baron's elite guard while the goblins find employment as spies and assassins.\n\nWe lost one of our number, but we gained new friends. And isn't that what D&amp;D is all about?\n\nTL;DR - see the title. It's essentially what happens.",

Coraim tries to pray to Olidammara through music from his lute, but fails and no divine intervention happens. Lexter used mount to summon a horse which him and Coraim escaped on, killing a few guards with crossbows, while Iaghar and Vido were left to find their own way out of this shitfest. Iaghar and Vido tried to escape into an alleyway, but a shady looking guy jumped out from behind a dumpster and shanked Vido, bringing him down to two hitpoints, stuck between a mugger and the guards. The guards kill the mugger and begin to arrest Vido and Iaghar. Suddenly, Coraim and Lexter appear again on their summoned horse, and kill a couple of the guards. Iaghar attempts to kick the remaining guard in the head in order to knock him out instead of killing him... and rolls a critical, the DM rules that just like all our other criticals, it explodes the body part it hits, the guard's head.\n\nWe continue running towards the gates with Iaghar and Vido, but see 4 more guards. Coraim had a plan, he surrendered, and when the guards came up to arrest them, kicked the closest one in the balls, turns out the guard's a woman... still kicking damage but no longer any reason to not have just crossbowed her. Damned patriarchal assumptions. Party started to fight, and the next round Coraim casted charm person on the guard he had kicked, and told her to call the other guards off. She called the guards off, all the while calling Coraim \"her boyfriend Jerry\", we assumed his new last name was Seinfeld. After that the party just kind of left without any more trouble.\n\nAfter that we decided we would start a revolution against the king, why? why not? We knew there was a village to the South and would start recruiting there. On our way to the village we were attacked by wild baboons... even though we were in a temperate forest. We killed two of them normally, but then Vido shot the third with a crossbow bolt, he rolled a 20, we rolled to confirm... 20, rolled to confirm double crit... 20, rolled to confirm triple crit... 20, rolled to confirm quadruple crit, no more (thankfully for the baboon) but it confirms. We don't even roll for damage, the baboon's health is so low (4 HP, what a waste) that even rolling a 1 on damage would kill it. The baboon doesn't just explode, it's body parts fly at least a dozen meters in the air, and land in the surrounding trees, no part of it is recognizable as an ape of any kind. We rest and continue on to the village after that.\n\nOnce we got to the village Coraim used bardic knowledge to find out if the people were loyal to the king, he finds out some are, some aren't. The rest of the party goes off to do their own thing. That was the end of today's session.",

        "text": "I'm sure I'm not the only one that this has happened to, but in two different RP situations I've been in, I've played as the weakest character in my party, and got fantastically good strength rolls, allowing me to pull off feats of strength that quite frankly, the characters I made should never be performing\n\nThe first time this happened was also my second RP experience, and my first year at university. I was playing Traveller and was the team's scout-sniper as a 1-meter tall Droyne, and was the weakest character in the team. What happened to this character, named Trevor Dun Dun, was possibly one of my favourite moments in the campaign, where I nearly died laughing. Our three strength characters, an Aslan, a robot and a homebrew \"space-troll\", all attempted grappling a guy in power armour, one after the other, and each and every one of them failed, winding up in a 3-man headlock. All of us found this hilarious, and I decided to throw all logic and sense out the window by trying to grapple him as well...I succeeded. The GM described the events that followed like so: \"You grab the guy by the head and suplex him, slamming his head into the ground and freeing your comrades...there's a steel chair next to you\". This event is referred to by our group now as \"the Dun Dun Suplex\"\n\nFast-forward to a more recent time period during my second year and a session of a zombie RP I was in this week. My character was again the weakest member of the party, and was stuck down a pit with a zombie cow that was running along the wall (our GM decided to throw mad science into the mix). After I was pulled out of the pit, we also had to pull out another guy who was a stuntman, and was slightly heavier than I was. The strongest person in the party was able to pull me out on their own, but couldn't do it for our friend in the pit. Cue my rolling a natural 20...I pulled the guy out of there by myself - which is hilarious, because my character in that RP is about 5'4\" and was incredibly scrawny and lightweight - yet could do what a powerfully built drill sergeant couldn't do\n\nSometimes, the dice rolls are complete BS...but for me, it almost always seems to end well",

        "text": "So as part of  our agreement, my boyfriend would only post his [gametale](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4gya5d/an_ideal_world_the_story_of_gm_fuckery_and_tears/) on the one condition that I post *my side of it.* Boy howdy, that is quite the task. To be honest, the clusterfuck that was to be had was so **intense**, my memory cries at the *thought* of telling this story with efficacy. However, I will do my best to explain the amount of bullshit that transpired over these games. So whip out your baby wipes and ready yourself for a tale of tears and a ballad of butthurt. \n\nBut to keep things concise, I'll just start off with our rogues gallery of player characters. Obviously, Cullenoscopy also wrote about the player characters in his introductory post, but he didn't pay as much attention to everyone else, to be more in-character. I did however, and the GM being infatuated with me at the time (awkward), talked my ears off about the other PCs and the setting, so I'd like to think I can fill in the many blanks he left.  \n\nAlfred/Asmodeus – Half-elf Sorcerer. He was set up, very clearly, from the start to be a villain. A mole in the party. Now, while this can be an amazing opportunity for so much intrigue, it was very poorly done. And by that I mean it was so *painfully* obvious, like a bullet wound to the face. It took a lot of playing my character even stupider than she actually was to pretend like I couldn't plainly see the betrayal set up right in front of our eyes. His player left half-way through the campaign, but his character was practically non-existent throughout most of our sessions. Honestly, it was like he was never even there in the first place. Basically our token evil party member.\n\nArtemis – Half-elf Spy. My best friend (also the GM's sister)'s character. They were very secretive about everything they did, going so far as to conceal their true gender to the whole party. The character keeps their history to themselves, which is just fine by me and my character. However, one secret that Artemis kept hidden in plain-sight was writing and publishing erotica about two of our other party members. As you can imagine, it made some of our mildly homophobic players very uncomfortable, especially since they could not take a joke to save their lives. If I can get her permission, I'll post the story here. True Neutral.\n\nCayden – Half-elf Cleric. The character of Everyone's Gay Best Friend. As his first character, he was kind of cheesy and stereotypical for a 'gay' character: pretty much a flaming leather daddy who used a whip as his main weapons. Still, probably one of my favorite characters, and his player became pretty damn good at not only gaming but roleplaying in general, giving all of us a pleasant surprise. He would frequently cast spells or summon monsters someone of his alignment shouldn't be capable of doing, but fuck if our GM ever noted that. Even though he was a silver fox in a studded collar, he was basically the mama bear who loved helping people and above all, children. Chaotic Good. \n\nDraco/Kinzon-Zii – Dragonborn Fighter. Played by a friend of the GM. As you may already know, there are no Dragonborn in the Pathfinder world, so our GM homebrew him this race. The way his breath weapon charged was ridiculous, and if his player ever thought to use it outside of sex (good ole 'thunderclap'), it would have probably been pretty broken. He was supposedly very honorable, and the more his player applied whatever trope from this week's fantasy show/movie/video game trope to his backstory, the more 'honorable' and 'epic' he became. There is a reason those terms are in quotation marks, trust me. His choices in character would suggest anything but. However, if you dared question his honor, angst, or fighting prowess (which I won't comment on, since we were all new and I'll blame incompetence on inexperience), he would whine at you anime anti-hero style about his pain and torment. Neutral Good. \n\nGenku – A Human Bloodrager. He was a Bloodrager in name only. Supposedly, Bloodragers are a very misunderstood class (in the setting), so Bloodragers tend to keep this a secret. His cover was that he was a Monk. However, his grand reveal was pretty lack-lustre, and the reason I say he is Bloodrager in name only, is that he never once used his spells, and only raged maybe twice, one time being in a very minor bout of PvP. Also, I have some pretty 'good' stories about his player, if we define 'good' by 'oh my goodness what a fucking grodebody'. I never really interacted with the character, so I don't know much about him. He was suppose to be basically Goku. In his player's own words, he wanted to play a Super Saiyan. While not impossible, that's quite a goal for someone who doesn't know jacksquat about power-gaming, and just generally in poor taste, I think. If I remember anything about Dragon Ball Z in my the dawn of my youth, it meant he basically wanted to play a demi-god. Haha, *yeah right.* Lawful Good.\n\nMurhe – Tiefling Magus. The character of my best friend's at-the-time boyfriend (still a good mutual friend!) So his player is a bit of a powergamer, and built Murhe to be a crit-fiend. Got his range down to 15-20. There was a lot of dispute if this was against the rules. I never paid any mind to feats that brought down my crit range because precisely these arguments. I'll look into it later and ask his player what he did exactly. Anyways, the character was a corrupted military general from Neverwinter who went mad after some plane-mashing bullshit (an event we dubbed Pathgea, when the world of Abeir-Toril 'became' Golarion), which will be explained later. So he played him like a typical Chaotic Neutral trickster, much to the ire of some of our party members. He is important to the plot, so remember this name.\n\nZomaj/Zomah Hauc – Half-elf (Drow) Alchemist. His name is in fact inspired by a character in MtG, but his player plays him as his own. He is extremely blunt, rude, and generally no good in social situations. No sense of humor. The only joke he ever understood was the 'brown and sticky' one. He also did not believe in the gods. Or love. It baffled the GM (and he disallowed it-- or at least, the attempt was made), who as the story played out, had a *very* different expectation of the character. Some of my favorite moments of this game was listening to the GM's perspective of a private rp he had with Zomaj's player, and then listening to the same private rp from the viewpoint of Zomaj's player. Spoiler Alert: I am currently in a relationship with Zomaj's player. \n\nAnd lastly my character...\n\nHanna von Harm – *Dhampir Cavalier, have no fear, von Harm is here!* So Hanna was actually just an expy of an original character I had for an original story. Despite this being my first game and not being at all versed in Pathfinder rules, I think I built her pretty well. She was a major damage dealer and overall tank in battle, while still being pretty versatile out of combat. I'm not going to toot my horn much, so I'll just leave her description short: she is a Sarenite Cavalier of the Order of Penitence. Forgiveness and redemption are a cornerstone to her faith, and it left me as a player super frustrated playing her sometimes when I just wanted her to SKRAIT MERC A NIG AIGHT. Still, I really enjoyed playing as her and would like to again sometime. Neutral Good, with emphasis on Good. Her Goodness is so Good, she made two of the main baddies Heel–Face Turn.\n\nSo I joined later than most of the other players. Only Zomaj's player joined a week before I did. I had just moved from my home state to live with my best friend and was invited to join the game. I was pretty excited. I had only played DnD 2e before, so this was a completely new system to me. I heard the party was not as... cohesive as we'd like, with tensions running high between Draco, Genku, and Murhe. Murhe frequently picked on their characters. I was treated to a story of Draco sleeping in a tree, when Zomaj threw a bomb up to wake him; Draco fell out of the tree and Murhe coated the ground with Ice Slick so Draco would hit the ground hard and slip. As much as I would have liked to play another Chaotic Neutral character and default to 'Misrephoth' (a character I use in almost every new  game I try), I decided it might be more helpful to play a sweet, kind, and all-forgiving character instead. Hanna von Harm. Now, I jumped in at around level 4. I didn't really understand how feats and all that worked, but I apparently picked some decent ones. Our GM let us take 2 ability score improvements instead of the typical one. That got pretty crazy fast, but I knew no difference being unversed in how this game should be played. \n\nReally, the most enjoyable thing about this game was that: all of us were new, and we knew fuck-all about the rules or how the game worked. It's when we started doing research and the reading we should have done in the first place that our discontent start to take seed. Once we realized what bullshittery the GM was pulling on us to save his precious NPCs, we got pretty fed up pretty quick. It is in first arc of this campaign that was honestly, pretty fucking fun! So for the next chapter, I'll be detailing my first session, some out-of-game anecdotes (including rude house guests who piss and shit on the toilet without flushing and cleaning it up), and how well a new GM with eight new players fare their first game.",

        "text": "[Parts 1 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4guh5q/dd_5e_chronicles_of_the_great_telbara_war_pt_1/)\n\nSo I had to post the first three parts because they were kinda short, but here's the next part. Also since this next part adds our very next player, I'd figure I'd go ahead and give you the cast of this ongoing campaign.\n\n* DM: /u/Owler_DND\n* Enialis: /u/csubakkaa (Cleric)\n* Theresia: /u/sleepyhun (Warlock)\n* Velis: /u/naszerinted (Rogue)\n* Smough: /u/Canwebeday (Fighter)\n* Argyus: /u/lunchboxx1090 (Paladin) (yours truly)\n* Wilfred: /u/TheFireTrucker (Wizard)\n\n**Part 4, Wilfred:**\nAs the party continued on the road Theresia had another dream involving the shadowy woman, taking away the new eyes and giving back Theresia's old eyes she screamed he must be freed and that that she will meet Theresia soon enough. \n\nFurther along the party were attacked by a small gang of goblins. They were no match for the party and were quickly dealt with  after that the party moved on eventually reaching Braidwood. Whilst walking in town they found met a farmer by the name of Lindal. Lindal was relatively helpful and directed the party to the inn which was ran by Merla High-Hill the daughter of the town elder, Bree.\n\nAt first Bree seemed oblivious to the war much like the others in the town. When the party told her the news she seemed to take it well. She also asked if the party could deal with the current Goblin problem plaguing the town. In exchange Bree would help the party find a means to cross the great Serpent River. The party agreed and set off leaving Alaina in Bree's hands. At the entrance the group saw it was guarded by a couple of bugbears. During the fight a third one appeared. After quickly dealing with the bugbears they found a man in robes bound and gagged they helped him free. The man was a wizard named Wilfred Hunter. Wilfred was heading to Ludok when he got ambushed. He offered to help the party deal with the goblins in exchange of going with the them to Ludok.\n\nAs the party moved further in they were attacked by a pair of Carrion Crawlers accompanied by 3 Rust monsters. The fight ended with Argyus's armor nearly being completely destroyed by the rust monster. As the kept moving forward the party spotted a trip wire that would have led to a cave in that would have crushed those at the front. However Argyus's magic shield made the party stand out. Enialis who was at the front was unfortunately caught off guard when a bug bear dropped down and brought him down in a single blow the panic allowed Argyus's shield to revealed the other goblins standing above the party on a ledge. The party quickly dealt with this encounter and Enialis was brought back up to his feet. The party found a way up the ledge and used it to set up an ambush of their own on the leader of the goblins. A large Bugbear with 2 hobgoblin bodyguards and several other goblins. The party managed to get the drop on it and defeated it. The party took the bugbear's distinct necklace the party quickly found a treasure trove which was mostly coins a couple of potions and glowing gem which they discovered could summon an earth elemental if the gem is smashed. All of this was contained in a bag of holding. With all their new loot the party began to leave the cave.\n\n**Part 5, Visions:**\nAs the party go to leave the cave they see a rust monster that ran away when it saw them. Argyus was carrying the armor the hobgoblins were wearing to use to patch up his armor cursing the cruel god who let there be rust monsters in this cave. \n\nThe party quickly returned to Braidwood. They found Alaina helping around the inn so that she had something to do. Bree greeted the party and asked for proof of their victory. The party showed her the necklace. Bree told them it was the mark of a powerful Hobgoblin warlord known as The Red Blade. After the party rested they got ready to set off, Bree gave the party a scroll of the spell Tongues. Lindal the farmer offered to be the guide to the river. On the route to the river the party set up camp and spoke with Lindal. Saying that Alaina was Argyus's sister using the alias Miranda, a name the party had agreed on a  few days prior. Lindal told party he thought it was best if “Miranda” be left in the next big town the party found for her safety. Eventually the party were set upon by a group of Lizardfolk the party used the scroll to be able speak with the Lizardfolk. After a tense stand off the party were taken to the Chieftain a strange Lizardfolk Shaman named Runles.\n\nRunles told the party that the lizardfolk were known as the Autumn Scale Tribe. The party managed to discuss the chance of being helped across the river, Lindal was sent off back to Braidwood the party spent the night with the tribe and were given a soup that was laced with some form of mushroom. The party grew tired and saw Runles looming over them grinning the party then suddenly woke up and they were in the waterway they had used to escape Eleris.\n\nAs the party followed along the waterway they once again met with Sir Hammond in the same place met him before. This time however he was more aggressive challenging them. Smough tried to attack Sir Hammond. This was to no avail as Hammond instantly disappeared then reformed into 4 suits of armor that carried flying swords. After a tough battle the party were successful and moved on to a dark gateway. As the party entered they were separated from Alaina and each other. \n\nSmough found himself in a long empty corridor he saw a giant wolf made of fire moving towards him. Smough took up his sword and rushed towards it. \nTheresia found herself in a wooded area she knew all to well as she kept moving forward she found saw herself twisted and hanging from strings in a tree similar to the shadowy woman in her dreams, a man sitting on a thrown carrying a silver scepter walked towards her demanding to be freed in exchange for more power.\nWilfred found himself chained up and held up whilst a man walked towards him saying hello friend at which point Wilfred's arms were crushed into a bloody pulp by the chains. \nArgyus found himself in the aftermath of a bloody battle surrounded by bodies as he looked through the bodies he saw that many of his loved ones were among the dead, a woman impaled onto a wall called out to Argyus blaming him for this happening to her.\nEnialis found himself as a child being chased by people carrying torches. As he continued running he saw himself getting older until he saw a crane standing in front of him. He then saw himself as he was now alone. \nVelis found himself sitting on a throne people whispering and shouting traitor.\n\nAfter this party found themselves back together again standing in front of a scaffolding with 7 figures hanging on nooses it was themselves and Alaina. As the party were taking all this in a strange sword appeared in front of them and spoke out to them giggling and telling them to follow it\nThe sword looked a single slither of metal with no guard or hilt. It was the colour of rust yet it gleamed what little light there was. It led them across wasteland until the party saw a low cliff standing on top of it were 3 other swords a long sword with a  blade that looked like a rod of iron encased in crystal, the second a shortsword that seemed to suck all light into giving a slightly aura of darkness. The 3rd and final blade was a giant great sword with a bright red blade with a long black streak running along the side of the blade.\n\nThe party were then transferred into room full of a bones a skull rose up and became engulfed in flames challenging the parties will to fight and their will to fight a fight ensued and the party were all but taken out by a fireball, only Velis was standing and had to fight it on his own, he managed to defeat the skull leading to a  flash of light. The party awoke finding themselves on the opposite side of the river totally unharmed....\n\nTO BE CONTINUED",

        "text": "So our group had been playing 4e for the better part of 3ish years at this point, so our DM suggests we take a break from our epic level god slayers and roll up some Gamma World characters. \n\nNone of us had ever played Gamma World before, so it was all new for all of us. Characters were rolled randomly and you were pretty much stuck with what you got. \n\nI ended up with Uncle CJ. He was a 6ft tall alien cockroach with a knack for technology, mechanics and hoarding. His armor was chain link fence over a Mexican poncho, his shield was a yield sign, and his weapon was a tube sock full of nickels. \n\nWe got our first rolls on the junk table and Uncle CJ got his later to be iconic gas mask and Santa Claus hat, which like the defunct super hero he was, never came off and caused him to sound like a 1960's horse track announcer with a bane mask on. He was also bestowed an industrial sized radio flyer wagon which contained the rest of his junk. \n\nHis best (and only friend) was an android made to be a body double for the President, but after the event looked like a two face version of Jimmy Carter and the terminator. And the only reason he stuck around was because Uncle CJ was the only one capable of repairing him. \n\nWe were also joined by Fluffy Bunny Slippers, the inaptly named amorphous pile of dirt and the psionic spider lady that CJ fondly  dubbed Mama Long Legs. \n\nWe were tasked to go investigate some lights coming from this old science building. So we agreed being the kind hearted simple minded folk we were and set off fighting some generic enemies, CJ  brainwashing a Clicky along the way. Named it Pedro, and bestowed CJ's highest honor upon him. A hat. A football helmet. \n\nLater discovered that the science building had been taken over by a sentient Mr. Freeze like refrigerator who was trying to refrigerate the entire world or something. So several terrible puns and half eaten  garbage cans later we fought this refrigerator who managed to kill our \"Tin Man\" and mess up the rest of us with several turrets and other contraptions. \n\nWith the refrigerator slain and the world saved Uncle CJ mourned the loss of his only friend and bestowed upon him the highest honor. A hat. A plunger... Since it was the only thing I could find. He loaded Tin Man onto his wagon and set off into the wasteland, after collecting both of their shares of the  reward of course. \n\nAnd thus ended our one shot of Gamma World. So if you ever decide to give Gamma World a try maybe you'll run into Mexican trash santa and his sidekick Pedro, on a quest to revive a former robot president. ",

        "text": "Ooooo... where to begin. Well, I guess to build up some anticipation for more posts to come, I'll preface this with this. This is the Pathfinder game where I caused my GM to cry human tears and end his campaign. I wouldn't say that I Old Man Henderson’d his game, but because of the actions my character made, I caused him the quit GMing our game. \n\nNow, for a little disclaimer. This is not a GM horror story. Granted there were many, and when I say many, I mean MANY times all of the players were either scratching their heads or all out pissed, but I'll get into that later. Another thing I wanted to add, was that this was all of our first Pathfinder game, even the GM. It was vast ignorance that kept our party together.\n\nLet's start off with the cast shall we?\n\n\n* Murhe - Tiefling Magus, who had a knack for flying and shoving icicles up other characters’ asses.\n\n* Artemis - Half-elf Spy, always kept its identity secret, even his/her gender.\n\n* Draco/Kinzon-Zii - Dragonborn Fighter. Since Pathfinder doesn’t have a Dragonborn race, our GM just allowed him to just make up stats for it on the fly.\n\n* Genku - Human Bloodrager, ummm… well… no one in our party had no clue what his deal was.\n\n* Hanna von Harm - Dhampir Cavalier, DPS tank and got shit done all while smiling and chanting about redemption.\n\n* Asmodeus/Alfred - Half-elf Sorcerer. I have no clue about this dude. The player hardly did anything in game and when he eventually left the game his character was given a half-assed goodbye.\n\n* Cayden - Half-elf Cleric, always joyful and pretty flamboyantly gay, but when you piss this mother hen off… I’ve seen limbs rendered.\n\nAnd finally my character\n\nZomaj Hauc - Half-elf (What the fuck is all about these Half-elves…) Alchemist.\n\nNow let me help you get into the mindset of Zomaj, because that will help you understand all of my perspective in this game:  I fucking hate meta-gaming. So at any point that my character does not interact with other characters, I pretty much just shut off my ear-balls, crawl into my corner, and just draw or clean up my character sheet. \n\nSo who is Zomaj, and why is his backstory matter? Well, shut up and I’ll tell you, geeze… \nZomaj was born to a Drow woman and some random dude. Mama Zomaj (her name was X’ullrae) was a prostitute. She would fill her son’s head with tales of Drow pride, and how if he were to put effort in his life, he could enslave anyone he ever wanted. Perfect picture of a wonderful mother, I know. X’ullrae died from Whore’s Rot when Zomaj was just a wee little lad, and thus Zomaj was placed in an orphanage. There he made friends with a young man who would one day be adopted by the queen of the city that we were living in (which to this day none of us even know the name of). Well, even though my character was best friends with this guy, I as a player still don’t even know this fucker’s name, I mean what the fuck, right? Well, since I’m a Thin Blood, I was never adopted. So when Zomaj turned 18, he was kicked out of the orphanage and made his way to the main keep, becoming a lowly servant for the queen and her family. After many fuck ups and Zomaj loving blowing shit up, he became an apprentice alchemist and over time became a somewhat prominent member of the royal court. \n\nWhy does any of this matter? Cullenoscopy, you’re boring the hell out of me dude, get on with it. Look, motherfucker, I told you hold on a minute, damn dude… Anywho, this off the bat raised some questions when I was doing character creation with my GM. Why was the prince adopted from some shitty little orphanage? Royal marriage, that shit-- I mean she had two daughters. Also I wanted a lot racism towards my character. I was expecting everyone to hate me, but no. No hate, I didn’t find out until later that my GM is very PC and doesn’t like racism so, no Drow hate. Even though there was a war against the Drow still fresh on the minds of the populace. But, despite all of that, I still worked some racism into my backstory, and thus came out this fucking awful, spiteful, blunt, and stand-offish character that I love to death.\n\nPersonality wise, Zomaj does not give a fuck. I know medically there is an organ that resides in the back of everyone’s brain that gives all living creatures a daily dosage of Fucks. Zomaj was born without this gland. If Christopher Walken came up to my character and said, “I got a fever, and the only prescription, is more Fucks.” Well, I'm sorry buddy. I guess little Bruce Willis will never get his father’s ass watch. The other very important thing was Zomaj was an Atheist. At first my GM would not allow it. He said that the gods were too prominent in everyday life that there was no way he could be an Atheist. I said, “Look dude, remember when I told you that Zomaj didn’t believe in Magic? Because since he was an Alchemist he could ‘create Magic’ and thus everyone's perspective of Magic was wrapped in superstition and it was all smoke and mirrors? Well, you wouldn’t let me have that, so, dude, let me have this.” He eventually allowed it, but ruled that he was suffering from a mental illness and that’s why he was an Atheist, yeah, okay. \n\nSo because Zomaj was a loner. He would spend all of his free time in his lab and did fuck all. And thus, I missed out on so so so much story and that’s why my perspective of the story is jaded. But with the help of my trusty girlfriend (who played von Harm), I will give y’all one of the best damn stories you’ve read. \n\nFellow Redditors… let me breathe deeply in your ears with my halitosis, and with my cheeto stained fingers, point out the story of...\n\nAn Ideal World: The Story of GM Fuckery and Tears!\n\nTo be cont...",

        "text": "[As part of my massive, chaotic barrel of fuckery that is the Odd Comet series](https://redd.it/4gus95), there's quite a bit of interesting lore stuff happening in the background. Let's delve into it a bit!\n\nFirst things first: Magic gone haywire. Shortly after the start of the campaign, most of the divine magic on the comet suddenly stopped working. Paladins, clerics, priests, and so on could no longer call upon their gods for power. In OTHER places, magic started acting stronger, unpredictably, and randomly. People investigating this phenomenon often come down with a case of exploding-eyes, and start raving about \"more magical power than should be possible\". Which leads to the next plot point.\n\nPowerful magical auras. As the party explores the comet, they meet strange people. And some of the people they've met have had... powers. Not just powers like being able to cast magic missile, but enough raw magical energy to wipe out a party, and all the things behind said party, and also the city that the party as in, and everyone in that city, and also the three neighboring cities. When looked at with Detect Magic, the sheer power of the aura tends to make people come down with acute cases of exploding-eyes.\n\nThe party's met several people with incredible magical auras. [Their first encounter](https://redd.it/48jeer) was with the [shapeshifter Shantalotte](http://i.imgur.com/oZnMfxn.jpg), who poorly harnessed her power in order to not only take people's physical forms, but their minds as well. And because she wasn't terribly disciplined at it, she ended up muddling herself with all the other identities she's adopted. She's managed to keep the problem in check by carrying around a ribbon made of Noqual to dampen her powers. \n\nNext up are a couple of people with magic that don't even really know they had magic. [Nodagog the shobhad monk](https://redd.it/4bfele) and [Villar the tengu ranger](https://redd.it/48sr0c). Neither of them had magic as a key part of their lives, so neither of them had even tried to harness it. So for them, their magic is more of a weird ephemeral inconvenience that causes strange effects in tense situations. Seeing as Villar is Ling Ling's totally-not-boyfriend, he's been undergoing some ranger training in order to get it under control.\n\nAfter that, there's [Spinebreaker](https://redd.it/4bta8c) and [the deer mouse](https://redd.it/4drkwc). Both of these individuals were aware of their power, and tried (inexpertly) to harness it for their own use. The only thing stopping them from complete conquest of the world is the fact that they're both utterly terrible at employing it efficiently. Spinebreaker is convinced she's some sort of archmage, a prodigy at magic, when the fact is she's just throwing magic around and just sort of hoping that it has the intended effect. The mouse was convinced that it was some sort of avatar of nature, and felt incredibly uncomfortable doing any sort of magic that didn't involve nature or plant life in some way. Neither of them have the discipline or training to properly use their powers, but the mouse is learning.\n\nAnd even further on there's [poor Emil](http://i.imgur.com/HaCLHVG.png), who is perfectly aware of his power, but has zero control of it. His power seems to be intelligent and malevolent, trying at every turn to make Emil's life absolutely miserable, and to spread that misery to everyone in the area, as well. But, as Shantalotte figured out, there's also a strange corollary- no matter how much bad stuff happens to Emil, things always end more or less okay. This is best exemplified by how, after six years of misfortune, he's still somehow alive.\n\nFinally, toward the end of the last story, the party met a few other folks. [Orthur, the human running the sanctuary](http://i.imgur.com/2eje8It.png), had another incredible magical aura, and in stark contrast to the others, seemed to be in complete control of it. As a high-level cleric, he can cast a ridiculous number of empowered spells on a moment's notice. He uses this power to keep his Sanctuary safe from incursions, infighting, and assassination attempts, and seems perfectly content with himself. While poking around in the sanctuary, the party also met a sort of meek young Kobold who was apparently some sort of techno-genius, and a strange golem with a very odd and twisty aura. Both of them had powerful magical auras, but the golem's was decidedly weaker.\n\nWay, way earlier in the story, Ling Ling had picked up a magical artifact from a mysterious ruin, which was described as a \"communications device\". With it, she's been able to hear the foremost thoughts of people with magical auras, and has used it to great effect when tracking down just who has the aura and whether they're planning anything nefarious. Thankfully, there have been no major incidents yet. Also, being able to read the thoughts of your not-boyfriend is rather nice.\n\n----\n\nAnd then, at the end of it all is the Tarrasque. The Tarrasque was a bit of a special thing, and when questioned about his history, he gladly told the party all he knew.\n\nSee, this Tarrasque was created by the gods of the setting, a group of six ludicrously powerful magical creatures that had basically been using the world as their own playground/game board. The Tarrasque was created by the gods as an engine of pure destruction, a walking \"reset button\" in case the gods really didn't like something and wanted to start over. The only problem was, they'd made it TOO WELL. The damn thing destroyed everything, whether the gods wanted it to or not, and they couldn't destroy it without MASSIVE damage to the world.\n\nWell, if brute force doesn't work, why not try enchantment? The gods hit the Tarrasque with a powerful curse, one that would make it intelligent enough to realize the full impact of what it was doing... and then, instilled within it a powerful set of morals that forbade it from destroying anything of value. Still not content with their work, they imprisoned the Tarrasque within a massive structure of artful statues, and sealed those statues within a tiny planet- that of the Rainy Comet. In physical terms, the Tarrasque could break his confinement at any time, but he's kept sealed in by his morals- destroying a cage so beautiful would be wrong, and destabilizing the planet to have his freedom would be even worse. All of this was directly at odds to his instincts, his basic purpose- to destroy, without pity, mercy, or end. Hence why he was a bit cranky.\n\nAnd so, the Tarrasque sat within its confinement, idling away centuries of isolation with deep thoughts and dreamless sleep. But with all the energy that had gone into its creation, the Tarrasque still felt a powerful connection to the gods, and could feel it when their energies touched the planet. And he felt it when, about seventeen years ago, the gods had done something drastic and powerful on the surface of the comet. Multiple times. And then, seventeen years later, the gods abandoned the comet entirely. That was why divine magic no longer worked. The gods weren't there to call upon.\n\nBy this point, the players started to piece together some important pieces of information- like how all the people with powerful magical auras were about seventeen years old, and how their power had only started manifesting in earnest when they were in their teens.\n\nThe Tarrasque suggested they were somehow \"chosen\".",

        "text": "[Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high...](https://redd.it/4fri37)\n\nThree badass, murderous chucklefucks were complaining bitterly about the designated moral compass forcing them to do boring shit like humanitarian aid. [Ling Ling the monkey girl](http://i.imgur.com/2SwMf0l.png), with her pesky conscience, had somehow gotten into her head that a worldwide water shortage was somehow the party's problem- possibly because [they may or may not have kidnapped, beaten the shit out of, and apparently murdered a couple of diplomats to humanity](https://redd.it/4fbzlr) AKA *The Guys Who Control All The Water On The Planet*. Thus, [Nibbit the murder dullahan](http://i.imgur.com/hQGnJ1C.png), [Loki the half-elf liar](http://i.imgur.com/LFK6CyZ.png), and [Jello Shot the magic slime](http://i.imgur.com/oNuhhTF.gif) were roped into going around to all the nonhuman settlements with big old stores of water, making sure that nobody was dying of thirst. It was the worst. There was no lying, no eating enemy combatants, and NOBODY named Lawrence. On the plus side, they had three good friends in tow- [a magical deer mouse whom they had extracted from a giant clusterfuck of gnomish mad science](https://redd.it/4drkwc), [a four-armed gentleman named Nodagog](https://redd.it/4bfele), [and their dear friend](https://redd.it/48jeer), [the shapeshifter Shantalotte](http://i.imgur.com/oZnMfxn.jpg).\n\nThankfully that state of affairs didn't last forever. As they were traversing a particularly precarious side of the comet, the ran smack into a weird bird-man who looked like a cross between a hobo and a crash test dummy. The bird man, upon seeing the party, rapidly started backing away, making excuses, and trying to leave as fast as possible. Which was when his pack tore open, revealing guns, alkali flasks and tennis rackets (anti-slime weaponry of the HIGHEST CALIBUR), the bounty posters for the entire party, and a big old map with Ling Ling's hometown circled. As the bird man tried to explain and assure the party that this was all a huge misunderstanding, four knives slipped out of his pockets and embedded themselves into the portraits of each party member. It was uncanny.\n\nQuickly becoming bored, Nibbit decided that he wasn't about to wait for any Lawrence to get the drop on him, and charged in axe swinging. He got a marvelous hit on the bird-man's leg, bringing him to his knees with an anguished cry of \"WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME!?\". That was a bit unusual, and Ling Ling stopped Nibbit and Jello before they could descend upon the poor man for the kill. Unfortunately, the attempts at first aid were both hilariously inept and horrifyingly painful, and the damn bird-man just would not shut up.\n\n[The man, apparently named Emil](http://i.imgur.com/HaCLHVG.png), was just a humble Syrinx vagrant with a terrible habit of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. In fact, he was so adept at getting himself into terrible situations that it was practically his full-time job. Apparently this had been going on for several years, about six of them, and the poor guy hadn't had a break for a single day in any of them. Jello Shot's suspicions were aroused, and he took a peek at Emil's magical aura, and just as he suspected, was nearly blinded. That's right, they had found YET ANOTHER person walking around with enough untapped magic in them to level a city.\n\nThey added him to the list alongside Shantalotte, the deer mouse, Nodagog, Spinebreaker (an orc who Nibbit wanted to kill),[ and finally Villar (tengu warleader and totally not Ling Ling's boyfriend)](https://redd.it/48sr0c).\n\nSomething was different about poor Emil, though. His power wasn't just untamed. It seemed to be alive, aware, and actively malevolent (see: Emil's entire life history). This was best exemplified when, in mid-complaint, two Earth Oni burst through the nearby stone and started attacking the party for no adequately explored reason. The party unanimously agreed that Emil was not someone they were keen on hanging out with.\n\nThe Oni swung their clubs, Nibbit axed quite a few things, Loki made some sneak attacks, Nodagog punched stuff, Ling Ling shot some stuff, the deer mouse conjured up a magical geyser, Shantalotte turned into an Oni and started hitting back, and Jello Shot tapped into all the ambient power flying around to cast one hell of an Enlarge Person on himself. Loki nearly died when an Oni critted him and knocked him far into the negatives, but with the help of one of his rogue talents, he was still on his feet, and had a neat scar to show the ladies for later. Jello Shot, on the other hand, was regretting his decision. Huge slimes were powerful, sure, but his dexterity wasn't the best to begin with, and becoming a Collossal creature firmly put it at a big fat 0. Which was a problem when Jello Shot found himself in a bad situation, slowly oozing off a cliff, and couldn't move himself without outside assistance. But luckily, the deer mouse saved the day with some druid magic and everyone was more or less okay.\n\nWith that taken care of, the party saddled Shantalotte with the responsibility of watching Emil and making sure he didn't trip over a rock and cause nuclear armageddon, and the party made a hasty retreat while they still had all their limbs.\n\nArriving back at town, the party took a brief break from hero-ing, found an extremely battered Shantalotte wandering into town, and then trouble started. Again. Three people marched up to Ling Ling's village, dead set on collecting the bounty on the party's head. Not the human bounty, but the Monster bounty, which specified a live capture. The three shady people in various states of suspicious cloaks, calmly asked if the party felt like taking a nice long walk to some folks who wanted to meet them.\n\nSadly, the situation was somewhat ruined when the head mysterious figure started sniffing the air and looking directly at Jello Shot. Then some exposition happened. See, these figures represented a group called the Mirror Men, a society of shapeshifters, doppelgangers, and lycanthropes who had bonded together on the tiny world in order to stand a better chance of survival. But the shapeshifters knew Jello Shot. They knew him from a long, long time ago, back before shapeshifters were known on the world stage.\n\nSee, Jello Shot wasn't always Jello Shot. Slimes are functionally immortal, but sometimes they forget things. And Jello Shot had forgotten quite a bit. Like how all sapient slimes were descendants of one slime, and that one slime used to be a person, and that person had stolen the secret of shapeshifting away from the shapeshifters, and used it to form a tyrannical rule of infiltration, distrust, and rampant consumption. That person was named Prometh, and to the shapeshifters, he was literally satan. And, oh yeah, Prometh had once been branded with a powerful mark that marked him to the nose of shapeshifters everywhere. It was undeniable. Jello Shot was the largest and most coherent fragment of Prometh ever encountered.\n\nNeedless to say, Jello Shot and the shapeshifters were not terribly fond of each other. But Loki, Nibbit, and Ling Ling all sprang to his defense, saying that he'd changed, turned over a new leaf, etc, and how about we all go on that nice walk now without bringing out the giant fucking siege cannons and combat tentacles in the middle of town, eh?\n\nThe party trundled off, mistrusting the shit out of their escorts the entire way, and arrived at their destination: A large facility built into the side of the comet known as Sanctuary. The place had been aptly named. The man in charge of it, [a cheerful human fellow named Orthur](http://i.imgur.com/2eje8It.png), was quite insistent that no violence was to be done within its walls, under pain of high-energy magic vaporization. Jello shot peeked at his aura- yup, there was another incredibly powerful magical aura...\n\nThe party was shoved headfirst into a meeting of various races, including gnomes, halflings, elves, monsters, kobolds, some sort of robot dog, liches, and more. And all of these charming individuals were VERY interested in why the party had taken it upon themselves to kidnap-murder-assault the human ambassadors, attack the dams alone and unsupported, and then conduct various humanitarian aid efforts. Ling Ling took center stage, with Loki as the smooth talking backup. Jello Shot very seriously considered eating the elvish representative, and Nibbit just looked bored- [until Spinebreaker the orcish archmage showed up](https://redd.it/4bta8c). Then he immediately switched to murder mode, abandoned all pretense of civility, and did his level best to kill the smug orc while his entire party tried to prevent him from fucking up ABSOLUTELY GODDAMNED EVERYTHING. If you could imagine a United Nations meeting, except half of the people are trying to kill each other with office furniture and the other half are either panicking or eating popcorn, that would be grand. Throughout the whole thing, Orthur was the one keeping the unruliest elements in line with ridiculously powerful Hold Person spells.\n\nEventually, though, the meeting was passed without bloodshed (but boy was it ever a close thing). Nibbit trundled off to sulk, and the party was given free reign of the massive underground terrarium that was Sanctuary. In a few days, there would be another meeting about what to do about the asshole humans controlling the water, and the party wanted in on that discussion. It was just a matter of staying put in an accorded neutral zone policed by a single man with a cheerfully upbeat attitude and enough raw power to disintegrate every single one of the atoms in your body with a wave of his hand. It was simple, right? Just stay put and DON'T KILL ANYONE.\n\nSo naturally the party got bored and decided to check out some rumors that there was something interesting at the very edge of the Sanctuary, something calling itself the Oracle. Not having anything better to do, they ditched Nibbit, packed their shit, and headed out for the mysterious glowy caves.\n\nThe Sanctuary turned out to be fucking IMMENSE, and by the time they arrived at the edge, they had gone extremely deep underground. And then they started seeing weird carvings- glowing hands jutting out of the cave walls, covered with old, mysterious runes. They traveled onward, getting alarmingly close to the center of the comet, and finally reached the end- a massive wall of enormous, interwoven statues forming a great aperture into a deep, dark chamber. It even had a hand-shaped staircase leading up to the opening. The party cautiously stepped in, peeked around, and found... not very much. So they cleared their throats, and as politely as possible, asked if anyone was hiding in the massive underground vault in the center of the planet.\n\nThere was a great and powerful rumbling as something absolutely massive rumbled up from where it had been laying in wait. A footstep that sounded like a falling skyscraper, then another, and another, until [an absolutely massive face, deep orange, studded with scales like armor plates, with wicked, pointed horns and an eye of pure angry malevolence, swung into view](http://img02.deviantart.net/cf7f/i/2013/154/f/5/tarrasque_by_m0ai-d67o70m.jpg).\n\n&gt; TARRASQUE: \"What?\"\n\nThe party didn't quite know how to respond to this turn of events and tentatively asked if the 130-ton murder machine staring at them in angry impatience was the oracle.\n\n&gt; TARRASQUE: \"I am.\"\n\nWell then.\n\n&gt; TARRASQUE: \"You have questions. Ask them.\"\n\nThere was an awkward silence as everyone tried to figure out what they should say to a creature that could easily kill them, their family, and the entire world without breaking a sweat. Finally, bold as ever, Loki marched up to the front and asked the Tarrasque how best to meet girls.\n\n&gt; TARRASQUE: \"Confidence. You wrap yourself in doubts and insecurities, which you blame upon your split ancestry, but in truth, you carry that prejudice more in yourself than others do. You must learn to value yourself before you can convince others to value you as well.\"\n\n&gt; LOKI: \"Holy shit... uh...\"\n\n&gt; TARRASQUE: \"You have difficulty making friends, Loki, you convince yourself that you are not worthy of their friendship. But look at the company you keep. They would all risk their lives for you, and have, on multiple occasions. Though they may tease you and make fun of your troubles, they have always been there when it mattered. Stop searching for some escape from yourself, and be content with who you are, and where you are. Also, I recommend dive bars.\"\n\nAs the rest of the team howled with laughter at this last comment, Loki tearfully thanked the giant Tarrasque and sat down to consider the wisdom of his words. Ling Ling stepped up next, and asked how she could deal with the massive responsibility that had been thrust upon her.\n\n&gt; TARRASQUE: \"Responsibility is two-edged. With it comes capability. Ever since you were saddled with the care of these people, your life has been drastically altered. And though you see it as worse, you must consider all aspects. You have accomplished more than you would have ever dared to dream than if you had merely remained home, with no burdens upon you.\"\n\n&gt; LING LING: \"Wow... uh... But how can I be sure that I am doing the right thing?\"\n\n&gt; TARRASQUE: \"You must consider, carefully, the consequences of your actions. You must try to see things from different perspectives, and find the best solution available to you. And where there is none, you must create your own. You can never escape some sense that your actions are wrong or misguided, but what matters most is what you choose to do, here and now.\"\n\nLing Ling stepped away, and the party practically had to force Jello Shot in front of the massive creature.\n\n&gt; JELLO SHOT: \"Jello shot hungry!\"\n\n&gt; TARRASQUE: \"Yes. You always hunger, for new tastes, and for power, and for convenience. You take the easiest route for yourself, considering the consequences only as far as they pertain to you. And while there is wisdom in this, you must ask yourself- are you master of your hunger, or is your hunger master of you? At what point will you be satisfied?\"\n\n&gt; JELLO SHOT: I jiggle existentially.\n\n&gt; TARRASQUE: \"Was there anything else?\"\n\n&gt; LING LING: \"No. Thank you for your time, mister Oracle.\"\n\n&gt; TARRASQUE: \"Good. Then bugger off.\"\n\nWith that, there was more stomping and rumbling, and the Tarrasque flopped down in its enormous stone prison, and promptly started snoring. The party left, feeling as though their brains had just been concussed with philosophical bricks.\n\n[NEXT EPISODE!](https://redd.it/4hr41e)",

        "text": "*This is the first three part of a series of logged events of my group's current ongoing war campaign in my DM's homebrew world. Hope you guys enjoy it. If you have any questions, just ask.*\n\n\n ***Part 1, Escape!:***\n Chaos surrounded the Darthasian capital of Eleris, as boulders struck the throne room of the castle. The king charged a group of people to find his daughter in ensuing battle. They were Argyus Brenfell a captain in Darthas's army,  Enialis an elf cleric of Elera the Darthasian goddess of life, Smough the royal executioner, Theresia a Gesteran merchant who was trying to get some official trading papers and Velis Thalan an elven noble who's family line goes back to the fallen kingdom of Fissaria.\n \n After killing a few Asharnian soldiers they found Princess Alaina and her maidservant. As they reached her the maidservant was killed by an Asharnian crossbowman. The party managed to clear the way through the soldiers and made their way to the waterway underneath the castle. After finding a locked door Velis managed to pick the lock allowing them past.\n\n As they ventured deeper into the water way they met an Asharnian knight named Sir Hammond Asrien. After a brief discourse Sir Hammond was seemingly convinced to let the party live and let them pass him to the secret exit. When they managed to get out the party found a cart ladened with supplies and more strangely Theresia's cart was also there.\n \n After they were ready to go the party fled the capital seeing the ground stained red and huge plumes of smoke in the air. After they were clear from any immediate danger the party set up camp at which point they promised to help princess Alaina regain her country. The party then decided to rest and make haste to the town of Harlore hoping to find aid. The War has reached the capital it is the 30th of Summerpeak.\n\n\n ***Part 2 , Bandit Trouble:***\n Theresia is woken from a dream of a woman with indistinct features offering her power when the offer was accepted the figure proceeded to rip out Theresia's eyes and heart and replace them with something else at this point she awoke and noticed her powers had changed in the night.\n \n When the group were on the road they saw a merchant being held up by bandits after a brief battle the party were victorious. As they checked on the merchant they saw he was unharmed and grateful for their rescue. He was a Gesteran merchant with white hair and golden amber eyes by the name of Telum Vinco. He offered to give the party some of his wares which consisted on a huge cart loaded nearly to the top with weapons. after a brief exchange they parted ways with the distinct impression he was a war profiteer.  \n\nWhen the party finally arrived in Harlore they rested at an inn. Whilst there they heard rumours of bandits and that the town mayor (who was also the lords brother) had disappeared. Argyus bumped into a surly man who was seemingly the leader of a group of loud drunk men who seemed to be looking for trouble.\n\nWhen the party finally meet with Lord Harlore the party hear that the rumours were in fact true and he would offer aid to Princess Alaina if the group dealt with the situation. Alaina was left at Lord Harlore's home for her safety. During this time Theresia had made a deal trading spices from the carts the party had for copper from the near by mines that are ran by the Halflings from the town of Braidwood a few days east of Harlore. \n\nThe party made a a deliberately obvious display of wealth and pretended to get drunk as they headed towards the wolf's wood where the bandits were said to be camped. As they waited there were crossbow shots fired hitting Theresia the bandits however did not go in for the kill instead they fled into the woods, the party gave chase.\n\nAs the party searched the woods they wee attacked by a pack of wolves led by a dire wolf which was a tough fight but managed to get by. The party then soon encountered an Owlbear but with great skill and luck killed it before it managed to harm any of them.\n\nThe party got further they found a small pack of guard dogs set to alarm the bandits of any intruder's approach the dogs saw the party and alerted them. But instead of them attacking they stayed at a distance as the party skirted past the dogs they found the bandits had taken up residence an old hunting lodge the bandits were well hunkered down and were taking potshots at the party as they advanced shouting that the party were dogs of Lord Harlore. The party managed to parley with the bandits and entered the lodge. They discovered that the “bandits” were in fact led by the missing mayor, Edrick. Edrick told the party that Lord Harlore was in fact in cahoots with the Asharnians and the party frantically ran back to town to discover the truth that indeed he was allied to the Asharnians.\n\nWhen the party managed to get to the manor they were faced with a group of Asharnians who were the loud group in the inn earlier their leader being the man who nearly started a fight with Argyus. After a bloody battle in which Lord Harlore was badly wounded and the leader of the group of Asharnian's, a man named Silas, lost his left arm when fighting Smough. After the fighting was over the party captured Silas, Lord Harlore and a strange Asharnian cleric of the god Vaashgryr. They then searched the manor finding the princess relatively unharmed.\n\n* ***Part 3, Allies and Enemies:***\n it is the next day after the chaotic events the party choose to interrogate their captives. They started with Silas who mocked the group for letting him live he also revealed that King Gareth had been killed his head being left on a spike at the capital the part were not sure to trust him but left hi in a cell. The party next tried to interrogate the priest who was part of a group known as The Faithful a powerful religious movement in Asharn other than that the priest seemed rather unhinged only shouting out the names of the Asharnian gods over and over again. \n\nThe arty then moved onto Lord Harlore, badly wounded but still alive. He explained why he betrayed Darthas and said if the party had any kindness they would simply slit Princess Alaina's throat over letting her live to see the inevitable fate that awaits her.\n\nAfter the party had finished their interrogations they met with Edrick who offered the party a couple of family treasures a silver shortsword that detects monsters as they get near, That Enialis was given and a shield that can shed brilliant light which Argyus took. He also promised that he would lend his support to Alaina when the time comes.\n\nAfter that party spent some time around town gaining supplies and Argyus arrived back at the manor to find the paces deathly quiet they had found princess and those who stayed were fine but then went to the basement to check on the  prisoners only to find a couple of dead guards and the Asharnian cells open with only Lord Harlore left in his. Argyus found a note in one of the cells, it was written by Sir Hammond Asrien challenging Argyus and Smough.\n\nThe party split up Argyus and Smough meeting with Sir Hammond  allowing the others to escape with the Princess. When the two men met with the knight their conviction was questioned and were asked if they were truly loyal. After the discussion reached a conclusion Sir Hammond Asrien raised his sword and challenged them to fight him 2 on 1. in the first exchange Sir Hammon downed Argyus with little effort leaving only Smough to keep fighting. After a couple rounds of combat Smough was also defeated by Sir Hammond.\n\nAs Sir Hammond advanced he was interrupted by an arrow shot from the shadows and retreated despite being unharmed. Argyus and Smough were rescued by 2 men one named Eric Larkin the other (holding the bow) Harris. Eric pointed out that despite their injuries Argyus and Smough were not life threateningly injured and it seemed that Sir Hammond was holding back. The group made haste and caught up with the others on the road.\n\nEric revealed himself to be a spy working for Alaina's late father. He told the group that King Gareth was indeed killed at the Battle of Eleris meaning that Alaina was now Queen of Darthas. He also scolded Argyus for being too quick to trust him with the party's plan to reach the city of Ludok. Eric then went onto explain the faithful a little more, that King Aldrich of Asharn's brother, Duke Harrold was left as regent and King Aldrich had brought his young son to Eleris. Harris was then revealed to have severely injured King Aldrich in the battle but the Faithful at the battle were quick to heal the stricken King leading Harris to have been captured and eventually rescued by Eric.\n\nEric then asked the party if they wished him to maintain his service to the crown suggesting he head to Gallensa the capital of Asharn. Velis suggested that Eric should also sow rumours of the party's route they intend to travel to confuse their pursuers and to find information out on Sir Hammond,Eric handed Queen Alaina a sending stone to which he had the corresponding one to keep in touch with him. the party then parted ways with Eric and Harris and went along the road towards the Halfling town of Braidwood.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED",

Koshkin run for the safety of the rubble just as the Rancor enters the chamber in the middle of all the tunnel entrances. Everyone opens fire but their weapons for the most part can't pierce its hide, Devan charges the Rancor with his vibro axe in hand, Critical hit, hi cuts deep into the rancors calf causing it to scream in pain. The rancor blinded by pain charges the group that is hiding behind the rubble, Devan is kicked aside and knocked to the floor badly hurt. the rest of the group dodge terancorscharge but are now standing mere feet from it. \n\nTwo rounds pass without much incident no one can leave the close combat without fear of being picked up and crushed by the great beast. Titus throws a Thermal Detonator behind the rancor hoping its large body will shield him and everyone else from the blast. he throws too short Devan is spared the blast but everyone else must try to dodge the shrapnel kicked up from the tunnel floor, Koshkin is torn too pieces and scattered all over the party members while everyone else dives for cover behind the rubble.\n\nThe Rancor survives the blast but is dazed and in an awful lot of pain Titus runs for the tunnel exit towards the slaves, Acalia is in hot pursuit and throws another thermal detonator behind her to try and kill or at least halt the Rancor, the thermal detonator bounces off a tunnel wall and behind the rubble, both the unconscious Devan and Jeni are caught in the blast as well as the Rancor, Devan who cannot dodge gets blown to the other side of the tunnel yet due to the sturdiness of the Trandoshan race survives (with one hp before death) Jeni is not so lucky and gets incinerated by the blast, a charred smudge covers the wall where she used to be. The Rancor staggers forward before falling forward, the flesh on its back charred and torn away revealing its spine, it twitched slightly before dying. \n\nTitus and Acalia turn back to check for survivors, the pick Devan up and carry him to the exit and have the slave medic to tend to his wounds while they themselves get patched up. \n\nAnd that kids is why Thermal Detonators are bad for you.

        "text": "So, it starts off with a party of seven. I can't remember all the races or any of the names though, never bothered to ask. We have a (half-elf)Wizard, Cleric, Magus, Druid, (dwarf)Barbarian, (half-orc)Samurai, and my (human)Sorcerer.\n\nSometimes a player can't show up, so the DM plays their character.\n\nWe started all coming to a village from various directions. We were actually only 6 at the moment, our Samurai won't show for a couple sessions. I noticed a well that was deeper than the usual well, and seemed to be unused for a little. so I noted this for later. (I have low-light vision, so I could see easily that it was deep.) The others find other strange signs, such as a dead man in the street.\n\nAt the Inn/Tavern, we chat with the innkeep/bartender about this, he says the water has been poisoned. The rain today (it was raining btw) was a blessing for that reason and stuff. Our cleric does a lot of the talking and finds out that the village sits over an underground lake, which is the source of water. (Which explains the deep well.) And we, all being varying degrees of good-neutral, decide to help out and find the source of this toxin.\n\nEven though it's directly above, the only access is a river 2 days away that goes into a cave that takes another 2 days to get back. We travel, our Druid saving us rations by making survival checks to hunt. We encounter some kobolds at one point, easy peasy. After 2 days we find the river, and walk a short while downstream to find the entrance to the cave. \n\nThere are a couple bandits right outside, talking about some guy named Redblade. Quick easy fight, we leave one alive and question him. Turns out this Redblade is their boss, and he's poisoning the village so he can use it as a new base of operations or something once everyone's dead. We leave him and steal their weapons as we enter the cave.\n\nTwo days of traveling, and somehow no encounters. (Our DM says some good rolls on our part helped avoid that.) Just a small ledge that my 7 STR couldn't climb for 5 rolls, the barbarian had to pull me up with a rope. We find this lake, a rope is hanging from above the middle of the lake from the deep well, and our cleric and druid both cast Detect Poison on it. DM says it's like a neon sign that's blinking [POISON POISON POISON]. Nat Twenty from the druid says it's Hemlock, ingested poison so it's not too dangerous to slip in. Someone bottled some, I forget who.\n\nMy perception score of +10, plus my cat familiar aiding me for another +2, notice a small orb in the water. Using Mage Hand I pull it out, and the poison seems to disappear (except from the bottle for some reason.) Now that the poison is done, the stubborn barbarian decides that he doesn't want to walk 4 days to get back to the village, so he swims (barely, with help from the Magus) to the rope and *climbs up the rope*. It involved a lot of climb checks and fort saves, plus some rage to help, but he made it to the top. Then passed out.\n\nMeanwhile, right after he started climbing, our Wizard found a strange section of the wall with a button. I push the button and the wall crumbles onto me. Thankfully, rocks fall nobody dies, just some non-lethal damage. Behind the wall is a staircase leading up to the village, while we can hear the barbarian angrily climbing the rope we just walk up. I run up because my character is childish.\n\nThe stairs lead to an empty house, strange. Even stranger is the hatch to the stairs disappears once we're all through it, and nobody can get it back open. We leave, cleric heals the dwarf, and we go find the mayor. He says the orb is some ancient dark magic or some shit, same thing with the disappearing hatch apparently. Also we mention Redblade. Then we rest for the night and wake up to find a caravan has arrived. The mayor pays us for saving the village, which we immediately spend on wares the caravan has brought. I buy a better backpack (3 more pounds of carrying capacity, 2 more pounds of backpack. Totally worth it) and some scrolls. (Disguise Self, Expeditious Retreat, Vanish, and *Color Spray*(this one is important.)) Others buy some things too, all I can remember is the Magus getting a masterwork bastard sword. She had a lot more money than I did...\n\nThey also tell us about a town *where adventurers make their names* or something, obvious next hub is obvious. But we have a bone to pick with Redblade, and so does this Samurai named Jack that showed up out of nowhere to help us. Him and I immediately become friends.\n\nWe head back out, with horses this time, and find the bandit spot again. This time there are 3 bandits, because the universe seems to be more difficult if there are more PCs. Another easy fight, but I almost kill the last guy with a critical acid splash. Thankfully he survived and surrendered. Intimidation lets us know where Redblade's camp is so we go, tying him up and taking him with us just in case he's lying.\n\nWe get attacked by kobolds one night, but our new Samurai intimidates them away, free EXP. After 3 days we find the camp and let the poor guy run away, he didn't want to be there at all. We approach at night, and argue how to attack for 30 IRL minutes, until they hear us and force us out of the bushes. A total of 10 bandits, a couple in a tower shooting arrows, and a big guy with a red sword. (Never got his name though.) The fight is a little tough, our Samurai manages to kill with every hit (because he attacks weakened targets that the Magus, Wizard, and Barbarian damaged, but still.) And eventually we fight the guy himself, he charges up and... misses the barbarian. I go up behind the barb and cast color spray, crippling this guy and basically making this villain that was built up for like 4 sessions just fall over and not even get to attack once (other than the miss.) The barbarian and magus slaughter him while the samurai finishes off the last bandits.\n\nAnd that's how we got to level 2. We haven't split the loot yet, as last session ended right there, but the martials are arguing about who gets the sword. (It's a +1 blood crystal longsword.)",

        "text": "In Fall of 2015, I was part of a six-person group at my college that played Shadowrun 5e. I was a puny, nerdy, human decker who wore a duster jacket with a shotgun hidden inside. Our party was a motley crew of freaks and rejects that all got called in to be the bodyguard for some scrawny Mr. Johnson that pissed off the wrong guys. Basically, that job went south really quick due to some mad-as-the-vexed-sea cyber-ninja Jensen bodying our asses. However, as luck would have it, we managed to pull this kid out of his sticky situation.\n\nAfter a bit of recovery time, we caught word that this guy's business partner got kidnapped and tied up in some Chinese restaurant run by the Triad on the bad side of town. So, we pull up to this place in our adept's beater of a car and try to pull off a rescue mission. Our tanky Troll headed upstairs. He ripped the lock assembly out of a side door and threw it at someone upstairs leading to a firefight that he wasn't quite prepared for. The adept and street samurai tried to get in the back door to no avail. I was watching all this happen for the trunk of the car by taking control of the CCTV cameras outside. Seeing the struggle my party was going through, I tried to short out the back door bouncer's cyberarms. I failed to do this and now he knew what was going on.\n\nI go into the front door of the restaurant to try to save my buddies. The waitress grapples me and puts me in a chokehold and the \"customers\" start pulling out guns. I take out a flashbang and try to stun the two booths of baddies about to turn me into Swiss cheese. I fail my roll and the grenade just goes and fucks off. Meanwhile, two of my friends are bleeding out on the kitchen floor after getting shot and falling down a flight of stairs. Being on my last point of stun HP, I get the bright idea to hop into the matrix, hoping to trick the waitress into thinking she's knocked me out. Success! I proceed to go on a gory campaign of causing almost every enemy's cybereyes to explode into glorious jets of blood and sparks. After seeing the last pair of eyes pop off the grid, I hightail it back into the trunk. I almost saved everyone's life. Almost. Until the last guy who can still see comes barreling down the stairs with a fucking grenade launcher.\n\nAll I see from the CCTV cameras is the front of the shop explode. A grenade launcher pops on the grid. I don't know where my friends are and I'm out of options. I have to do something. I hack the guy's launcher and detonate a grenade. A 40 foot wide, 20 foot high explosion shakes the building. Two of my friends are caught in the explosion along with the grenadier. The three of us remaining hear sirens in the distance. Our driver makes a vehicle handling check to see if we can evade the police. Dice are cast. Critical glitch. The engine puffs out black smoke. The adept and tank decide to leg it. Me, a weakling to begin with, taking -3 to all checks from stun damage can't keep up. I decide to try to find somewhere to hide. I go down alleyways desperately searching for a dumpster or something. The sirens are closing in. Fuck. I book it back to the restaurant and curl up in the fridge. I pop a dreamchip hoping that I won't be in cuffs when I wake up. No sch luck I'm afraid. I'm interrogated and pinned for 14 counts of murder and several counts of possession of illegal goods. RIP my first character.\n\nTL;DR I blew up a restaurant, killed two party members, and got caught by the police",

        "text": "[Two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4edhad/jesus_plays_pathfinder_part_15/), I had to leave early, handing off my character sheet to the DM and thusly committing my spirit into my Father’s hands. I was later caught up on what happened in the court of the Drow matriarch...\n\n----\n\n##Previously on \"Jesus Plays Pathfinder\": \n \nBefore the black-hearted villainess could respond to my offer to ransom my life for that of the dwarven granddaughter, the eldritch suit of armor she had assembled for the ceremony triggered a horrific transformation. She became “half-possessed,” transforming partially into a demonic entity. A maelstrom of darkness swept through the throngs of Drow gathered to watch the moment of glory, siphoning their very souls as fuel for the abomination that stood before us. \n\nNeedless to say, my party decided to do what would make the most money: fulfill their contract by retrieving what was left of the cursed armor and the kidnapped dwarf.\n While most of the fighters stumbled over the now-thick bodies of the Drow to attack the heaving tangle of blackened horns, G. Zuss and Orcbro’s wife, the slyph druid, rushed to the side of the captive. The prisoner’s hand was permanently bound to a gauntlet chained to the wall and crested by a Ring of Friendship, ensuring that any damage done to the former matriarch would be inflicted upon her as well. After G. Zuss failed to pull her hand from the gauntlet, he cast Shield Others to share the burden of damage. ...It felt pretty familiar after taking on the sins of the entire world. \n\nWhile the warriors dueled to a standstill and my cleric healed everyone, keeping them upright, the slyph summoned a rock elemental to bash the gauntlet over and over, trying to somehow shatter it and free the ring from its victim. One strike...two strikes...three strikes. The situation was looking more desperate, as the entire party’s survival hinged on removing their enemy’s trump card from play. \n\nSuddenly, out of nowhere, Orcbro lunged toward the captive, bloody longsword drawn. With a single savage strike, her hand was lopped off and the magical connection severed.\n\nThe tides of battle began to turn, and the matriarch realized that the advantage was no longer in her favor. She created a massive tornado that whipped through the room, tossing bodies everywhere. When the dust settled, she was gone without a trace, taking the ceremonial armor with her. \n\nThe battle was won. But unbeknownst to our friendly neighborhood Savior-man, a new story was just beginning. \n\n----\n\n##Making Trades\n\nTo make a long story short: Orcbro is the new DM. Halfway through the session, after the climactic Underdark brawl, the old DM took his seat at the foot of the table while Orcbro laid out some miniatures and began to pace excitedly. \n\nI knew this moment was coming. Ever since a road trip a few days ago (wherein I let slip that I like to play trollish characters like The Paraplegic Halberd and The One-Man Cult), he let slip that he was finally acting on his longtime plan to eventually run a campaign. \n\nI wasn’t sure how to handle this then, and now that the moment was here, I still wasn’t sure how to handle it. I decided to observe for now, and see whether Orcbro would allow as much focus on looting and killing as the last DM. \n\nIn the meantime, former DM started wrapping things up from his own campaign. \n\nThere was one Drow survivor of the aftermath, a bloodied priest. Tears streamed down her face as she begged for mercy.\n\nThe players took a vote on whether to spare her, with predictable results. Zuss began to passionately plead her possible redemption.\n\n“I cast Silence on the area!” one the players said. Zuss mouthed fruitlessly. \n\n“EXECUTIOOOOON!” everyone else yelled simultaneously (presumably silently), and the deed was done.\n\nG. Zuss wept. \n\nAs my fellow murderhobos ransacked the court for loose change and Zuss prayed for the dead bodies, the DM fast-forwarded us to the doorstep of the dwarfish noble--the one who had taken out the bounty that launched this entire quest. He seemed slightly pleased to see his granddaughter again, but it was easy to tell that he was far more emotional about losing the ceremonial armor.\n\nA nat 20 on remembering the contents of the contract gave Zuss near-perfect recall.\n\n“It is written,” I said, trying to ignore the giggles coming from my right side, where the one friend who is in on the joke clutched her mouth closed, “that you outlined the exact details and location of the armor, along with an enormous sum promised for a complete collection. But for your own granddaughter, you tacked on a careless footnote offering a small bonus if returned alive. Do you care so little for your own flesh and blood?”\n\nThe other players rolled their eyes at the cleric’s lack of subtlety, but it was apparently exactly the piercing question that set the nobledwarf’s guilt unraveling. As we could have already guessed, he was hoping to use the ascension power for himself. He was just lucky that the Drow matriach suffered its curse before he did. \n\nAs the other characters gave a collective shrug and began literally shoveling their reward into the Bag of Holding, Zuss took the granddaughter aside. While attempting to heal her hand back onto her stump, I asked her how she felt about her relative. \n\n“He’s not a very good person,” she decided firmly. \n\n“Do you feel safe living with him?”\n\n“Honestly, no.”\n\n “My child, you are a cleric like me, are you not? Why not journey with us instead? I can protect you and teach you as we spread the word of our god.”\n\nI really wanted to say “take up your crossbow and follow me,” but I couldn’t remember what weapon proficiencies she had.\n\nThe DM gave me a look. I forgot that he was trying to trim down the party from its currently massive double-digit character count. No disciples for G. Zuss today. \n\nI got teleported mid-conversation to the market, where the real important roleplaying happened: buying and selling loot. Zuss received 734 gold from the party bookkeeper after “administrative fees” from the adventure. Orcbro had also apparently gotten the memo from the former DM about being concerned over Zuss being broke, because he called me into ~~my father’s house~~ a local temple of Sarenrae to have a word with the priest. \n\nWe had a brief, but fulfilling conversation. The priest said that he had heard tell of my efforts. Handing me 9,000 gold pieces, he bade me use it in whatever way I deemed necessary to set up churches where I traveled. My initial instinct was to simply give it all away to the next commoner I saw, but held off. Zuss had significant skill in carpentry, and a Craft Wondrous Item feat. Perhaps 9,000 was enough to buy a miracle. \n\n----\n\n##A New Quest\n\nAt this point, the bookkeeping character, a Human Fighter named Prezzel, attempted to bully Zuss into coming back to his headquarters: a mercenary guild that was essentially fantasy Blackhawk. Prezzel pointed to Zuss’ name on the long-term binding contract...which was conspicuously absent. \n\nHe forgot: If you didn’t roleplay it, it didn’t happen.\n\nZuss spoke up before Prezzel got any more flustered. \n\n“I do not bind my soul to what is of the world. I prefer to let my ‘yes’ be ‘yes’ and my ‘no’ be ‘no,’” I said, kicking my giggling friend under the table, “and I say to you that I will travel with you and aid you for as long as I may. But, since I have not signed the contract, no goods are owed to me. You may render onto the guild that which is the guild’s, and I will be content with the scraps.”\n\nThe other main murderhobo, a Halfling Sorceror named Perry, perked up. A free pocket healer?\n\n“I can definitely respect that decision,” Perry said, cutting off his compatriot. “Can’t you, Prezzel?”\n\n“I’m glad you feel that way,” Zuss bowed. “I think the world would be happier if more people didn’t care about money.”\n\n“I’d be happier too!” Perry said, breaking into a broad grin. \n\nFollowing my lead, Orcbro’s wife’s character (Khastin the Slyph Druid), and my female model friend (an Elven Wizard named Tessa), also asked to become “Independent Contractors.” Orcbro arranged things so that we still received mostly equal shares, but we weren’t bound by word or law to the mercenary company. Prezzel asked for an audience with his commanding officer to approve the unconventional memberships and provide an account of the journey so far. He returned with the news that there were two new contracts to be filled--Orcbro’s not-too-subtle method of splitting off our party and bringing it back down to four. \n\nThe time had come to part ways with Orcbro’s character, Ragnar, along with everyone else’s secondary characters. I gave Ragnar a more-subtle version of the “on this orc I will build my church” speech. He looked at me blankly, said “You talk lot,” and that was it. \n\nGo ahead and deny me, Peter. We’ll meet again. \n\nBefore we left, there was one more person to add to this contract. An unassuming human who had been keeping watch from the back of the room stepped forward when the commanding officer called his name. Orcbro couldn’t actually pronounce the name, but the DM delivered “Sergeant Arlin Dilon” in a subtle but unmistakable French accent. \n\nThis would be the perfect time to insert a New Testament pun, but I’m honestly still at a loss. \n\nThe new party set forth on a new quest under a new god, toward parts unknown. My mission was still the same, but everything else had changed. I began searching through the online database for a Wondrous Item that Zuss could construct with his new funds and the two weeks’ travel ahead of them. \n\nI had narrowed it down to a list of about 40 when we ran into trouble. \n\n----\n\n##Zombie vs. Jesus\n\nWe came across a bizarre scene on the forest path: Two bears, or what was left of two bears were fighting a ten-foot tall, emaciated undead creature. The first bear had been reduced to a skeleton. The second was well on its way, having its life essence devoured by the monster that Orcbro helpfully named the Devourer. \n\nThe party elected to dive in. \n\nIt started off poorly when the former DM’s character vanished without anyone noticing, even after Perception rolls of 22. It seems as though the DM was possibly fibbing about his class. The remaining bear, hurt and confused, also began lashing out at its would-be saviors. \n\nI didn’t pay much attention to the combat--I had learned that a Pathfinder cleric just gets in the middle and spams Channel Positive Energy. I mostly used the time to look up Wondrous Items, but I was able to pick up on a few snippets here and there. It seemed that this “Devourer”--had reduced one bear to a skeleton and was draining the life from another. In its confusion, the remaining bear was attacking anyone that came close. \n\nI did attempt Enthrall, shouting “Peace! Be still!” But to no avail. \n\nMidway through, the Devourer unleashed some sort of spell that inflicted madness on its victims. Zuss failed, and got “babbles incoherently” as the negative effect.\n\nG. Zuss’s eyes unfocused and began rattling off his lineage. \n\n“Adam, who begat Seth, who begat Enos, who begat Cainan--”\n\nAfter a frantic battle, the party was able to blast a hole in the Devourer’s head and the bear simply sloughed apart, leaving behind an eerie greenish light. \n\nThe former DM’s character chose that moment to stumble out of the trees, yelling that he “got tangled up in a bloody bush!”\n\nI facepalmed as I realized that Arlin Dilon was a stereotypical French “fighter.” I was no longer the only troll in the group. But knowing him, there was more to the character than that. \n\nAfter failing a +12 Sense Motive check, Zuss shrugged and began helping to clean up his scratches, comforting him and reassuring him that no one doubted his honor. Arlin softened--in real life the former DM was pleased that I was the only one who hadn’t metagamed. He listened to me talk about my beliefs for a while, and nodded, thinking. \n\nPerhaps my new mission was to convert someone who used to be God? This was all getting a little meta, even for me.\n\nKhastin had transformed into a bear herself, and made the realization that the two dead ones were the parents of a cub some yards away. Embodying the the literal mama bear, she wrapped her massive paws around the cub, but it seemed to be upset by the presence of its dead mother and the creature that slew her. Zuss dragged both bodies off into the forest and buried them. As I returned, I took some branches and tied them into a circlet in order to make me seem more at one with nature to comfort the cub. As I placed the wooden crown on my head and cast Calm Emotions, Khastin seemed to approve, but Tessa burst into laughter. \n\nThe party made camp. I looked round at my fellow man (and bear, and elf, and halfling), and then up at the big Orcbro in the sky.\n\nAnd G. Zuss slept. \n\nHe was looking forward to what came next. \n\n----\n\n*Thanks everybody who continues to read these silly stories! G. Zuss truly lives in your hearts.*\n\n**EDIT: We didn't hold Pathfinder this week because of Mother's Day. Everybody do a Hail Mary in honor of mine! I'll see you again soon!**",

        "text": "Hello again! This story is a continuation of 'The Bad, The Mad and the Outright Terrifying: A Super-Villain's story Part 1', which  you can find here: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4ea5o6/the_bad_the_mad_and_the_outright_terrifying_a/. Part one introduced us to our not so heroic band and began to hint at the\ncurrent problems facing this lovely blue and green orb. Kitsune, our charismatic spirit medium, was serving his sentence in the New York City super-prison. Barghast,\na deposed nobleman with the ability to transform into a ferocious monster, was hiding out in a disused warehouse. Event Horizon, the speedster with a penchant for ballet, \nwas searching for work at Moe's Bar. Each of them was watching the broadcast that showcased the destruction of Earth's heroes at the hands of the Zel'tan. This is where\nwe find ourselves currently.\n\nThe world had taken a moment, collectively, to try and rationalise what had just happened. This was some sort of sick practical joke, it had to have been. There was\nabsolutely no way this was real. The moment passed when the recently uncloaked Zel'tan vessel's began to open fire on humanity. Beams of concentrated thermal energy \nbegan to burn through buildings, turning the occupants to a fine layer of ash. Glimmering tubes of light dropped down from ships, carrying hundreds of towering reptillian\nsoldiers with them. The invasion of Earth was well under way and humanity was already on the back-foot, scrambling desperately for any semblance of sanctuary or defense. \n\nMost of humanity, at least. Tucked away in relatively safe locations, our cast was still trying to determine what they should do. Minato had very few choices, locked\naway in a cell. Barghast was plotting the most efficient method for avoiding immolation while Event Horizon took another long drag of his beer in silence. The world \nwas turning to chaos around them but the supervillains were dealing with a more pressing issue: How the hell were they meant to survive this? The answer to their \nquestion would arrive, rather serendipitously, along with an unexpected guest. \n\nThere was the sound of corn kernels popping and someone was standing in Kitsune's cell. Minato fell off of his bed in surprise, giving a little yelp as he did. \nWrapped neck to toe in shiny black latex with a dark blue domino mask, his guest smiled down at him. She was attractive enough that, if the world was not being invaded,\nMinato may have even considered flirting with the charming blonde. As it stood, he settled for asking the obvious question.\n\n\"Mind if I ask who you are and what you're doing here?\" As charming as he was, the con-man was lacking his usual flair. It was replaced with a barely contained urgency\nand concern. The masked woman grinned cheekily and bowed with a flourish. \n\n\"Name's Transmat. I'm hoping that I'm in the right place. Are you Minato Arisato? Also known as Kitsune?\" There was a hint of an accent in her words but Minato wasn't able to place it.\nRegaining some of his composure, he stood and smiled charmingly. \n\n\"I am he. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I cannot help but wonder about your intentions here.\" Transmat's toothy smile did not abate, seemingly growing wider before she spoke.\n\n\"I'm your ride for the evening. Hope you don't mind some turbulence.\" Transmat vanished once more with the smell of cooked popcorn, she reappeared moments later with a small duffel bag. \nDumping it on the bed, she winked at Minato and unzipped the bag. Folded up inside was a well-tailored black suit with a stylised fox mask resting atop it. \"Party favour, pretty boy. \nGet dressed, quick as you like.\" The teleporter swivled on her heel, rocking back and forth. Minato grinned darkly, shrugging off his orange jump-suit as quickly as possible. \nA minute later, Kitsune finished fiddling with the cuffs of his suit with a concealed smirk. Transmat spun back to face him and surveyed the charismatic figure with a gleam in her\neye. \"You clean up nice. Ready to meet the boss?\" \n\n\"And who would that be?\" Being dressed in his 'costume' did wonders for calming Kitsune's frayed nerves, so the charm positively oozed from him. Transmat felt her heart flutter and her\ntoes curl as he spoke but managed to restrain herself from going full fan-girl.\n\n\"Who do you think? We stand around here much longer and we'll be late.\" She offered him a glossy arm and an eager grin. Kitsune tsked, displeased, but decided that anywhere was better\nthan a cell while the world was being burned around him. Taking the proferred limb, he barely had time to take a breath before the pair vanished with a sharp pop. The cell remained empty, \nsave for the lingering scent of buttered popcorn.  \n\nAcross town, Barghast slowly shrunk down into his human body. It was with some regret that he relinquished his power but the Baron was capable of more coherent \nthought outside of his beastial form. His clothes, while somewhat tattered, remained in tact as the shadow melted away from his frame. Tossing away a partially \ndevoured limb in disgust, Baron Rotezhan started pacing furiously across the floor. The vast warehouse stretched out before him but no matter how far he stalked, not a\nthought managed to pierce the desperation building in his mind.\n\n\"Of course, whenever you actually require the services of the caped buffoons, they have all met the their deserved fate. Typical! Just typical!\" He growled angrily,\ndiverting his rage to another target in liue of any productive planning. He gestured violently at crates, promising a pain worse than they could imagine, and tried to\nignore the sounds of conflict outside. Even from his remote position, he could hear the screams echoing through the city. The Barghast inside him coiled gleefully \naround his heart, eager to join the slaughter but the Baron quelled the savage impulses with a practiced thought. It would do him no good to enter the fray, not when\nthe Zel'tan seemed indiscrimate in their rampage. \"What to do, what to do?\" He mused quielty to himself. \n\n\"You could come with me.\" A gravelly voice spoke from the darkness. The Baron spun on his heel, gaze locking on to a shape hanging motionlessly in the air behind him. The man,\nif it could be called that, appeared as nothing more than two faint splotches of crimson light against the dark. It took a few moments for Rotezhan to recognise the \nglowing lights as eyes. His eyes sharpened, the shadow giving way to his preternatural senses; before him stood a figure wrapped in some kind of inky black shroud. \n\n\"Whoever you are, sir, you have made a dire mistake today.\" Barghast began to leak through, the Baron's voice becoming guttural as tendrils of midnight slipped over\nhis form. Rotezhan let slip his aura of fear, determined to taste the interloper's fear before he tasted his flesh. \"A mistake that will cost you your life!\" Snarling\nat the indistinct figure, Barghast began to advance only to stop. His legs refused to move and the Barghast was forced back into it's mortal shell with a frustrated\nhowl. \n\n\"Do not be so hasty as to waste an oppurtunity.\" The shadow spoke again, the voice now grating on Anthony von Rotezhan's nerves. Never before had someone prevented\nhim from unleashing the ancient birthright that slumbered within. This feeling of helplessness was entirely new to him and entirely unwelcome; merely fanning the\nflames of his anger. He gnashed his teeth furiously, hands clenched into tight fists. \"Which is more importa,nt to you, I wonder? Your wounded pride or your life?\" \nIt questioned the seething noble. His interst piqued, Rotezhan forced himself to calm down, burying his rage with the ingrained demeanor of civility. \n\n\"My apologies. I have endured much as of late and my temper has run loose of me, it seems.\" A strained smile stretched across his face as he bowed sharply. \"Baron\nAnthony von Rotezhan, at your service. May I enquire as to your identity, good sir?\" His words were like honey, his breath smelled of blood. His guest emerged from\nthe penumbra slowly, stepping into the light. Barghast was not terribly well versed in matters of superhuman politics but he recognised the man before him: Trenton \nAshlock, a dark sorcerer of great power. \"Master Ashlock. I did not recognise you so garbed in gloom. My apologies once more.\" The magic user inclined his head at the \nstatement but acknowledged it no further.\n\n\"I come bearing an offer, Baron Rotezhan; an offer of protection and an opportunity for substantial gain.\" There was no emotion in his tone but Barghast knew who the \nmagus served. There was no reasonable way to refuse such an offer and even if there, he would be mad to do so. If Ashlock's master extended his hand in the hopes of \ncooperation then the Baron would reciprocate. His smile turned gregarious as he straigtened his attire.\n\n\"I would be most pleased to meet with your lord. Shall we depart by air or by sea?\" Now the warlock smiled, ever-so slighty. Raising a hand, Ashlock gestured and \nseveral glowing sigils appeared around the unlikely duo. He intoned an ancient incantation, the words reverberating through the warehouse with power. At the peak of\nhis chant, the sorcerer paused. He locked eyes with a wary Baron and spoke.\n\n\"Nothing so mundane.\" There was a flash of blinding golden light, so brilliant that the entire building was consumed by it. Once it subsided, the warehouse lay empty \nonce more; barring a pile of several, partially devoured limbs that smelled vaugely of sulfur. \n\nEvent Horizon was neither pacing, nor particularly worried. In the grand scheme of things, he was fairly certain that he could outrun or outfight any problems that\ncame his way. As it was, the speedster was wondering if he really needed a job anymore. If aliens took over the world then would he really need to pay rent again? If \nnot, then there was no reason for him to be at Moe's. He could use a drink though. Thankfully, everyone had scattered after the invasion began. Only he and Moe \nremained in the seedy bar, sharing a quiet beer as they watched the world fall apart.\n\n\"Knew this was gonna happen.\" Moe grumbled quietly, fidgeting with his glasses. Event Horizon scoffed scornfully, drawing a rude gesture from the underworld figure. \n\"I did! As soon as the damn lizards showed up, doing their 'friends to humanity' shtick, I knew this was in the works.\" The diminutive man flicked a series of switches\nbehind the bar and leaned back with a smug smirk. Event Horizon turned, his attention drawn by gears grinding behind the far wall. The wooden surface shifted and \nrevolved, revealing a stairwell leading down. \"I had a security bunker installed, at great personal cost I might add.\" His sole remaining patron whistled appreciatively\nbefore finishing the last of his drink. \n\n\"Well, that's neat. Mind if I have another drink?\" Event Horizon's tone was comically nonchalant, as if secret bunkers were a common occurance. Moe grunted in frustration, \nthrowing his hands up in disgust. \"Is that a yes?\" The bar-owner sighed despondently, walking round from behind the counter. \n\n\"Sure, whatever. Drink your fill. Lock up when you go, yeah?\" That was Moe's goodbye as the older man vanished down the stairwell, the entrance covering itself back\nup. Event Horizon watched him go with some slight interest, idly filling up his glass with whatever was in reach. Sipping from the cold cup, the super-powered \ncriminal leaned against the bar-top and tried to figure out what he should do now. \n\n\"Like hell I'm going to lock up. Come on, Moe. Might want another drink later.\" Event Horizon laughed quietly to himself and enjoyed his beverage...until the entrance\nturned to a fine mist with a dull roar. Event Horizon spun in place, his unbreakable staff appearing in his hands seemingly of it's own volition. He watched, body\ntaut with readiness. A form appeared through the debris, the silhouette quickly revealing itself to be a man. The speedster watched with some disbelief as Pinnacle\nlevitated into Moe's bar, disdain across his sharp features. The world's most dangerous supervillain quirked an eyebrow at Event Horizon and spoke in a rumbling \nbaritone.\n\n\"You are the one known as Event Horizon? Good. We have little time. Come with me.\" The man in question looked around in some confusion, his staff held in front of\nhim defensively. He pointed at himself in bewilderment despite being the only one left in the establishment. \"Yes, you. Come along now.\" Event Horizon slowly lowered \nhis weapon, distributing his weight in case he needed to run. \"We do not have time for this. I offer you the oppurtunity to save the world and to become one of the \nmost powerful men in the world.\" Pinnacle finally touched down, his immense frame of muscle towering over the smaller superhuman. Event Horizon smelled a faint scent \nof mint as the man leaned in close. \"What do you say? Ready to save the world?\" A few tense moments passed before the speedster spoke hesitantly.\n\n\"Do...Do I have time to finish my drink?\" Pinnacle smiled humorlessly, a translucent sphere of energy forming around the duo. Event Horizon shifted uncomfortably as \nhe floated helplessly above the ground. The orb exploded through the roof, deflecting shrapnel from the building as it went. They rose into the air and the air was\ndriven from Event Horizon's body; Zel'tan ships dominated the sky, chitinous wedges unleashing devastation across the city. New York was in flames, tendrils of black smoke coiling into the sky.\nSeeing the broadcast had not been enough for the reality of Earth's situation to sink in. Seeing it, up close and personal...The speedster was not a morally inclined \nman but this level of slaughter was enough to make him physically ill and his heart clench painfully. \n\nHe only had a few moments to gape in horror as his unusual mode of transportation hurtled away from the war-torn city impossibly quickly. Event Horizon was slammed \nagainst the sphere by the force of their acceleration. New York vanished from site as they tore across the ocean, waves forming from in their wake. Pinnacle stood \nunfazed, his power crackling off of him in waves. Event Horizon finally peeled himself off of the orb as their destination appeared, the telekinetic construct slowing\nin response: A large island dominated by a vast fortress. The small-time criminal had no idea where they were but it was a long way from home.\n\nThe unlikely duo came to a stop directly over the fortress courtyard. Hundreds of figures were milling about, a multi-coloured horde gazing up at them expectantly.\nPinnacle descended onto a small stage, the sphere disappearing around him. Event Horizon caught himself as they fell, landing directly next to the nigh-omnipotent\nsuperhuman. The crowd watched them, some expectant while others were confused at the presence of a little known speedster. A show-man by nature, Event Horizon preened\nunder the attention and the association that people were placing on Pinnacle retreiving him personally. It was after a moment that Pinnacle glared at him, prompting\nthe egotistical criminal to hop off of the stage. As Event Horizon joined the masses, he could not help but notice that the mob was formed from other super-criminals\nand villains.\n\n\"Thank you for joining me, my colleagues.\" Pinnacle's voice boomed out from the stage, impossibly loud. \"As I am sure that all of you have noticed, our world faces a \ndire threat.\" The wall behind him flickered into life, a large screen displaying cities across the globe; all under assault by the Zel'tan. \"These invaders came \nclaiming peace and deliver destruction. They have already deprived humanity of their greatest champions.\" The crowd began to mutter discontently. \"Many of you viewed \nthem as worthy opponents, others as pests or obstacles. One thing that none of you can deny is that they have protected this planet time and again. Now, they are gone.\"\nA voice called out from the crowd and they parted, allowing Kitsune to speak.\n\n\"This is a grand speech, Pinnacle, but what is your intention here? You cannot mean to spur this eclectic band into action with platitudes of revenge.\" The con-man\nspoke with confidence, hiding his hesitation behind a facade of surety. Pinnacle focused on Minato, his eyes burning into the medium's soul. \n\n\"Kitsune, correct? No, I do not intend to stir your souls on behalf of our fallen foes. Instead, I present to you this unique oppurtunity.\" Pinnacle strode to the front of\nthe stage, smiling humorlessly. \"The world is bereft of heroes and under siege by a force that mankind cannot possibly stave off on their own. So...what do you believe\nwhat become of the ones who delivered them from this tragedy?\" The murmuring returned in force, suspicion mounting in the assorted super-villains. \"They would become\nheroes. And heroes...\" \n\n\"Are rewarded with whatever they desire.\" It was Barghast who spoke up, understanding filling his voice. Pinnacle nodded approvingly as realisation spread throughout\nthe evil-doers. \n\n\"If we liberate the world, if we are seen as their new champions then nothing will be denied to us.\" The mastermind raised his hands in the air, fists clenched. \"Money,\npower, influence! Anything that you crave will be yours!

        "text": "**The continued tale of Malaney Belrue.** [Click here for previous chapter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4fce3b/dnd_5e_uncertainty_at_its_best_pt_2/)\n\n*Rucejk La’Dhroo ab Jujnis, 2997*\n\n\nMother invited me! She invited me to dinner! My heart's still racing at the thought! See, breakfast came with a note on it and as I read it, I sat down, surprised by the invitation. Kimaris didn’t stay long enough to inquire about it, he downing his food and zipping out the door (he’s in rather a good mood).\n\nI then heard Bordel stir and wake. I was mildly embarrassed to be in the room alone with him, still I asked how he was. It took a moment for him to gather himself in his haze. He then mentioned that he was fine and was merely feeling his age. I gave a nervous smile and toyed the note in my hand.\n\n“Mother has invited me to dinner tonight,” I informed him. Bordel looked surprised, maybe impressed, by my news. I then asked if he would come with. If anything, he’d be able to enjoy a good meal. He did question whether it would be wise for him to join after the words he parted with upon Laeni. I nervously chuckled reminding him that he couldn’t have caused no greater offence than I had upon renouncing my faith.\n\nWith that, Bordel agreed. Part of me dreads having him come, but at the same time, I’m really happy that he accepted my invite.\n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n\n\nWell, the dinner was successful I suppose. Bordel and I gathered enough details from it, but I also walked away with a lot of anger.\n\nFern and I first went out to buy provisions. Knowing the standards of my home, my simple dress would not suit for the evening. Let alone I felt obligated to present gifts since my mother was humoring us and I would likely be seeing all of my brothers and sisters.\n\nOh! While we were out at the market, I saw Kimaris with Aragoth! The boy looked so happy. I mean, compared to the night before, it was rather endearing to see him carefree. Part of me even had an appreciation for the Dragonborn’s care.\n\nWhen it came time to go, I had thought Kimaris and Aragoth would have tagged along, but they had eaten too much at the market. Fern and I waited a little longer for Bordel to return, but it came to the point in which if we lingered further, we would be treading on lateness.\n\nI was rather disappointed at first. I truly thought Bordel had stood me up, but I didn’t let it deter me. I was going to see those journals with or without him! In the end it certainly paid off that I didn’t let my mood be soured by the man.\n\nBordel had been summoned to do some kind of investigative work on a case the town had. He being a former executioner, a Cleric for the death domain, I figured he got caught up in his work. It certainly was a lovely surprise when I found him coming up the lane as Fern and I approached the gates. I dare say he was dashing. His face was clean shaven aside from the well groomed mustache. I was impressed by his tailored suit and cane too. It was very fitting for the dinner party and I felt whatever undignified display he gave earlier would soon be forgotten by my mother.\n\nHe looks younger too. Like... late thirties maybe? Certainly not the middle aged man I first met a week ago. \n\nOnce in, I lead the way into the sitting room. It was a queer feeling to see my family all there. They looked very much the same, though nearly three years older. I dropped into a low curtsy and waited for my mother’s acknowledgement to rise. I presented my gifts and was surprised by the exchange of their own to me.\n\nI was given a wooden harp, a glass statue of a dolphin, a classic music box (with a ballerina figurine), a book of fairytales, and a teddy bear (of which I have half the mind to tease Fernwood with, considering the well yesterday).\n\nI do loathe the gifts... As lovely as they are, full of sentiments from childhood, I’ve caused enough grief on the family that I didn’t deserve such a welcome. Still, I played my part as a gracious receiver.\n\nDinner came and went, though with it’s minor kinks. Baiden offered Fernwood a job in town. The Halfling’s eyes lit up and she inquired about how it’d operate since she wasn’t sure if she was ready to stay put (what a lie that was). However, as they went on to discuss the matter of her hiring a shopkeep, Launi inquired about Bordel. My younger sister then had the audacity to whisper in my ear that he seemed my type! I can only hope my blush didn’t go noticed. I seethed at her that the Cleric was merely my boss. \n\nHeavens, that statement was made irrelevant after retiring to the Library. Mother eventually approached me and stated that I was welcome to go see the journals. I thanked her and in my euphoria felt dizzy. Two hands then rested upon my shoulders, bracing me, and giving a gentle squeeze. It was Bordel! And on top of that, I was reminded of the terrible itch my feathers were becoming.\n\nLauni linked her arm in mine to escort me to the Library, giving me a look that would suggest she was right about my crush. I pursed my lips and rolled my eyes. I’d be lying if I said that gesture in the Library wasn’t a hopeful note in my mind, but I’d be a fool. I haven’t done anything extraordinary to warrant his affection.\n\nWe made quick work scouring through the journals. Together our eyes covered the pages five months back and we gleaned a few details:\n\n-A merchant rumored that there’s a treasure in a volcano on Mythus island. My father is certain it’s a clue to another cup.\n\n-Theedain had obtained a cup of his own, but after I examined the room for auras, it was clear there was nothing magical present.\n\n-My father met a woman, named Lirena, on the island Ankmon, three months before he died.\n\nBordel and I were disappointed by the lack of information. Nothing was concrete, just more ifs and maybes and names. Then again, what had I to lose on these wild goose chases? It’s not like I have anything better to do as a Primordial- other than maintaining ‘balance’.\n\nWe did decide that we would investigate the docks for anyone who might have heard of the volcano on Mythus as well as check into the dealings of Remus Trophe. My father noted the argument he had with our Lordship, though what about I can’t be certain. My mind jumped to the conclusion that it had everything to do with the cup he found (perhaps the Order of the Empty Cups has been well established in my clan), but then again, my father clearly was embezzling money. It was disheartening to read, but it was evidence enough for my mother. His own greed had prevented him from Exaltation.\n\nHere’s what Laeni had to say after reading that section of the journal: “I suspected your father was up to something... how disappointing.”\n\nShe SUSPECTED!!! Yet she blamed me anyways!? Three years of being the black sheep and she had suspected all along!\n\nI plastered a smile to my face as she said it was good to see me again and how she hopes for future visits. I doubt I will ever come back. Correspondences, yes, but to be in her presence... never again if I can help it.\n\nTo add to that, upon returning to the Library, Fern spoke to us and said she would be taking up shop, meaning she was no longer going to travel with us. It was particularly troubling because Oda had left this morning to go to his home. With Bahamut’s words in my ears about safety in numbers, I couldn’t help but feel lost. For a  moment, I thought that we as the five Primordials could be family... now there is just the three of us.\n\nBordel certainly was in a better mood than myself as we walked home alone. And upon entering my room, the two of us were met by Kimaris, Aragoth, and some other Human, named Daevri. There was also a huge amount of goods in the form of armor and weapons. Right quick it was made known that Aragoth had stolen them under the persuasion of the Human. Not wanting to get involve with it, I excused myself stating, “My corset’s too tight to deal with this.”\n\nAfter stripping down to my dressing gown and washing my face, I returned to my room. Upon entering, I found Daevri climbing up Bordel! He was a nimble lad to say the least as the Cleric attempted to stop him. After perching on his left shoulder, the Human tried reasoning with Bordel about the goods, but was swiftly pushed off. The Cleric certainly wasn’t in a good mood any more with the shenanigans the other’s pulled tonight.\n\nSoon all left the room, leaving me alone with the ‘borrowed’ items. Fearful of being blamed, I snatched a pillow, blanket, and my journal before walking across the hall to Fernwood’s room. I had hoped she would have returned by then, but even after five minutes of waiting, no one answered the door.\n\nI then went and knocked on Bordel’s room. It was rude of me to impose on his privacy for the night, but he was kind to let me in. He even gave me the bed. I did remind him I wasn’t a stranger to the floor, I hadn’t slept in a nice bed in a long time. Still he insisted.\n\nWith all that had happened tonight, as well as feeling like I was infringing on Bordel’s kindness, I remembered my worry about Fern and Oda. I asked what we would do now that they have decided to go their own ways. The Cleric just shook his head and said, “If you had the chance to go home, wouldn’t you?” I scoffed. “Besides. Fernwood never really seemed much of the adventurer-” \n\n“She’s more of an adventurer than myself!” I cut in. She had more of a mind to this sort of life than I do.\n\n“True, but quite often there’s more than meets the eye. I believe there’s more to you.” Bordel then bid me good night and rolled over.\n\nHis optimism is comforting, but what if he or Kimaris is the next to leave? What if I find myself on my own? Heavens. You’d think being a Primordial would have it’s perks... like not fearing about being alone.",

        "text": "In what was really the smoldering death of my first campaign, I have four players but two were otherwise occupied so we ran the session with the original two. Parts of the story thus far: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4b6rbf/dd_5e_when_you_whine_about_what_you_roll_or_not/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4df5vx/dd_5e_when_the_dm_is_killing_your_imagination_by/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4ek5bo/dd_5e_when_you_cant_stab_the_ghost_butler_even/)\n\nThe party wakes up having dealt with the issue of securing the manor. The bard sets off before the rest of the party is up and about to deliver a message to Camelyn. The rest of the party is eating breakfast as the druid receives a wreath, quickly walks outside, turns into a bird, and flies away. The original plan was for everyone to go with the druid but with only the monk's and rogue's players there I decided to run the session in another town with just the two of them. Hearing the ring of metal on metal from the ballroom, the rogue rushes in and sees his commander unarmored fighting the manifested longswords. One missed attack later the captain informs him it's fine, he's just practicing, but it's good that the party is awake. The captain raises a blade making a gesture of surrender and the manifested swords cease their attack and float towards the far end of the ballroom. The duo are asked to investigate a separatist movement in the next city up the road (I already forgot the name of the place, so it'll just be called City) and told their contact in City is a woman named Shara who works in the inn. They are given a list of supplies and a letter of credit from the empire to cover the cost, both of which they are instructed to give to Shara and she'll take care of it. Before they go they are asked to return to be present for an important meeting in 7 days. Just outside of town the party comes across a merchant train and the rogue is eager to inquire about any magical items that the merchant may have. The merchant, disappointingly, has a significant amount of wooden furniture and no magic items. It takes an otherwise uneventful day and a half to get to city so the party arrives just after noon and has 4 days to do what they will before they have to get back (they would have known it was time to go back because people going to the meeting were also going through City).\n\nThey walk to the central square of town and ask a passerby for the location of the inn. There are two inns, The Green Tree and The Red Tree, sitting facing one another across the square. They choose to go for Red first, entering a well weathered inn and tavern and asking the server if she knows a woman named Shara. Shara, it turns out, works in the Green Tree and the party makes their way back across the square. The Green Tree is a much nicer inn though it has exactly the same layout and the server currently working is none other than Shara, their contact. List and letter are handed over and the party is lead to the garrison, a small walled encampment off towards one side of town. In the garrison the party says they were also sent to deal with the separatists and Shara, who is transcribing the list provided into multiple lists for the multiple suppliers she'll have to contact, calls in the garrison commander, a half-orc named Hirk.\n\nHirk is not overly bright. Hirk is not overly competent. Hirk does, however, bring the party up to speed on the situation. The force from the garrison keeps raiding known separatist houses and finding rooms full of dead bodies and broken glass. Also found some flyers with basic revolutionary manifesto on them that the party is given one of. The party are directed to the most recent house raided where two rank and file are posted to watch the place. The posted guards tell the party almost exactly what their commander told the party and allow the party entrance to the house. The party enters into a kitchen with one door off to their right and another on the opposite wall that is currently forced shut with a table that looks to have been recently put in front of it. This door is suspicious so the monk moves the table and looks out the door into the back yard of the house. The rogue carefully peeks into the next room through the door on the right and finding nothing actively trying to kill him opens the door fully. In that room the party finds trails of broken glass that, from the look of them, were formed when a number of bodies were dragged out of the room. All windows intact, just a decent amount of glass broken on the floor. The rogue decides this is the best time to get pissy with the people guarding the house and goes out to question them. The monk follows, as he often does, hoping the rogue doesn't do something to get himself hanged again.\n\nOutside the guards are nothing but nice to the rogue who is nothing but an asshole towards them. Why were the bodies moved? Because the place would start to stink if they were left. Why is the door propped shut? Because there aren't enough people to guard both doors and that one had been kicked in during the raid. Has anyone else been here? No. Is anyone in this town not stupid? The monk notes that they're just doing their jobs and this encourages the guards find it in themselves not to start beating on the rogue. Seeing that this is a dead end the party heads back to the center of town, taking a minute to stop in a shop and talk to the woman running it about how crappy of a job the Empire is doing all the way out here using the talking points from the flyer they were given. The shopkeep replies that she sees the truth in some of their points but to say those things is to invite the justice of the Empire. She also only has healing potions, no magical items, and the rogue's player is not happy with this. The other shops in the area all seem to be selling various wood products so the party heads for The Red Tree, the cheaper of the two inns, to spend the night drinking and listening in on conversations and the like. \n\nThe server talks to the bartender thinking she's out of earshot and talks about needing to make money and working a lot. Some apprentice woodcarvers come in, talking about how much they dislike their boss. Other laborers come in and also talk about how much they dislike their bosses. A couple of obviously not laborers come in dressed as laborers and talk about how they also hate their boss. The rogue tells the server that the monk is loaded. Later in the evening some caravan guards come in and talk about how the road is dangerous causing the two out of place men to occasionally comment on how the Empire can't even keep the roads safe out here and that's just awful. The rogue begins making similar comments, various parties buy everyone in the bar a drink, and the rogue makes his way over to thank the two pretend laborers for the drink they just bought. Rogue talks very openly and plainly about how the Empire is failing the people out here. One of the men tell him to keep his voice down, that kind of talk is likely to cost him his life. Same man also slips him a flyer and in a fit of genius the rogue heads out of the bar and sneaks around beside it  to read the flyer. It is nearly identical to the one he'd been given earlier except this one has a time and place written on it.\n\nThe rogue heads over to the Green Tree where he is given a steeply discounted room (and the rogue's player begins to complain that he has persuasion before Shara tells him she has to make some money on it or she'll get in trouble). The rogue tries talking to Shara in Thieves Cant and is pleasantly surprised when it works so he tells her how their day went. The monk drinks the Red Tree closed, fails to get with the barmaid, even with advantage that the rogue's player argued his conversation earlier should have given the monk (because it was certainly possible but a natural 1 and a 4 total do not quite cut it). Because of this the monk stealthily follows the two men into the residential section of town, seeing them go off into a house. Heading back to the Green Tree the monk and rogue go to their room and are awoken by a knock on the door.\n\nShara comes in and tells the party that another raid happened last night, same broken glass and bodies but given how unhappy the rogue was that the bodies were moved nothing was moved and the doors were guarded awaiting them. She also agreed with the monk that there might be someone in the warehouse district that had information but that the rogue might be more the person to talk to those types of people. The time on the flyer was late that evening so the party set about the only course of action suitable, aimlessly walking around the square talking to random passersby in an attempt to seem like they belonged there because the rogue's player was worried that they might be seen if they went and did any of the things they'd thought about wanting to do. That evening, their day of doing nothing complete, they head for the warehouse listed on their flyer and using said flyer gain entrance to the warehouse.\n\nThe men from the bar are indeed at the warehouse, one giving a rousing speech, the other off to the side doing some preparations. One cult sales pitch meeting later some of the people there leave and roughly 16 including the party stay to do more about the problem that is the Empire. The rogue downs his potion of mind reading, peering into the mind of the man that had done the talking and directing conversationally to think of the leader which was visually shown by an open darkened doorway. The other important person was a little nervous about the night's events and deeply anxious to see City and the surrounding area free of the chains of the Empire. The monk was serene, no real surface thought and deep thoughts of readiness and consideration towards all the people present. When asked if he wanted to check anyone else with the remaining 30 seconds of mind reading the rogue's player declined as the rogue punched the man that had given the presentation.\n\nInitiative was rolled, the monk's player rolled a natural 20 followed by the man that was just punched then the rogue then the other seemingly important man and rounded out by the rest of the crowd. The rogue's player was incredibly mad when the monk's player rolling a natural 20 initiative didn't put him ahead of the second man who immediately pulled out a vial, drank it, and died. The crowd waited to see what would happen and the monk did a fair bit of damage to the first man. The first man gave the monk and rogue a command to flee, the rogue failed his save while the monk made his. The rogue's player wasn't phased and kept saying it was ok, he'd get to make another save. The rogue ran from the first man in the most expedient way possible, sprinting out the door. The rogue's player was unhappy that he didn't get to make another saving throw not to do this. A man in the remaining circle announced that this was a matter for the legion, drew a crossbow, and put a bolt through the caster's shoulder. The monk knocked the caster unconscious and the man with the crossbow began to walk over to pick up the body as the rogue came back in. Crossbow man again announced that this was a legion matter and to piss off. Rogue replied that no, he should piss off. The three other members of crossbow guy's legion group, following initiative order as the rogue had just moved in, attack the person acting threateningly towards their commander, I roll really well, and they nearly beat him unconscious with their bare hands (+3 to hit, 2 attacks per round, 1d4+1 damage, I rolled natural 18, 17, 20, 14, 19, 18 and called 5 hits for a total of 24 damage against the rogue. The rogue's player, unhappy with the damage he's taken, asks me if I'm sure they hit and informs me that his AC is 16. Giving the rogue the benefit of my mistake and not taking the 75% chance of knocking him out that the last roll would have given me (he had 27hp) I told him that yes, I was sure, and crossbow guy asked him if he could be civil. Rogue's player managed to contain his whining for long enough for the party to follow crossbow guy taking the caster to the garrison to be locked up then began insulting Hirk for being incompetent. Party went back to the inn, knock on the door that night from Shara yet again telling them that their list had been procured and wrapping up what would happen going forward with the investigation. Rogue's player was full on sulking at this point and we quickly forwarded the party back to the manor arriving two days early. The rogue's player decided that now would be a great time to bring up how he feels like he screwed up his character for not being proficient in perception and asks me how he can get it. I tell him, again, that he needs to find a willing teacher and that it will cost some amount of money over a decent length of time. Surely enough the halfling clerk/forger that accompanied them to the manor is a willing teacher and he sets the rogue to watching the laborers work as the session ends.\n\nAfter the session I went home and the rogue's player asked the monk's player if I was just railroading him to die for story progression. The monk's player talked with him and then talked to me, telling me that the rogue's player wants a higher magic more dungeon crawly game. I agreed and shelved the campaign I was running and began preparing for the party to shift in towards a higher magic game. Part way through the week the rogue's player began talking about a mutual acquaintance that also plays D&amp;D and the possibility of playing his game if I didn't want to DM any more. Eventually he told me he didn't like the campaign, that he hadn't really liked after maybe a session in (which would have been when he was given a moderately cursed dagger that would always come back to him because he was constantly whining about wanting a belt of returning/blink back belt) and he wasn't sure if he wanted to keep playing. I asked him what he was looking to do in the game and got a bunch of non-answers and told me that he didn't feel like he could do anything and he didn't know what he could do. I replied that he could do almost anything but actions have consequences to which he again said he didn't feel like he could do anything  *because of* the consequences. I let him know that the game was going to change because he'd told me he wasn't having fun and my goal was for everyone to have fun. \n\nThis week's game went decently and will fall under next week's write-up when the party finished the stuff I had prepped for this week. A very early, incidental comment from the bard's player about the purposeful lack of magic economy in 5e may have made the rogue's player realize there was a reason that he hadn't run into any shops selling magical stuff. I've said the same thing to him five or six times but it never stuck. Still, we're heading for a magic heavy setting for a magic heavy campaign per request.",

Every night the fighter would contemplate the happenings of the day while the Paladin read a few chapters from his tome. The fighter would ask questions every now and again and the paladin would gratefully answer. \n\nFast forward a few in game months and they're in a dungeon under a tree. and then something tragic happens: The rangers animal companion dies. The paladin takes his time to bless the poor animal and wish it safe travel up to his god. they go on through the rest of the dungeon and fight the BBEG, a corrupted treant. its close, they almost get by without too hard of a fight, then the treant crits both on the wizard and the paladin. wizard is knocked unconscious at 0 and the paladin goes through a hole in the wall and goes under. He dies. he failed his 3 death saves. \n\nThe battle is over and the fighter cannot find his friend. Eventually he notices his best friend, strewn across the battlefield. The shock on his characters face made the table go quiet. Rushing to his side the fighter was begging him to be alright, pleading with Zeus to take him instead. But he was gone. With tears in his eyes and his heart he started to bury his friend. he asked if he could roll history to recall the prayer his friend used on the rangers animal companion and he Nat 20'd. I rule of cooled it and said he remembered it word for word. the fighter buries his friend and through his tears softly chants the prayer that he remembered. Right as the prayer ends a bolt of lightning strikes through the tree hitting him, blinding everyone in light. as the light fades you could see a lightning bolt etched on the bracers of his armor. Level 1 Paladin\n\nEdit* in case you guys were wondering i used [this](https://youtu.be/16i0_NdPowE) song when he found his friend. I like playing music during key moments because i believe it enhances emotions and makes the game more fun",

        "text": "Last session, my players had just finished a heavy 'big deal' encounter where they confronted some cultists trying to flood the world. (They convinced a dragon turtle to help them, bypassed like half my dungeon, and then destroyed the entire tower, but that's another story.) No players died, but they were all pretty badly injured, so at the start of today's game, they needed somewhere to stay. They had made friends earlier with this eccentric noble painter in the town, Edwin Elderberry, so they went to ask him if he knew of any local inns. He invited them to stay with him.\n\n\nIn the middle of the night, the rogue decides to steal some of Edwin's expensive things. (e.g. She wants his silverware, self-playing harp, silks, etc.) So she finds a locked door leading to a basement and tries to pry it open. One failed roll later, she manages to open the door but alerts a yappy dog with fur like a mop. It starts barking and Edwin wakes up and calls for 'Precious' to ask what's wrong.\n\n\nThe rogue wraps up Precious in a blanket to muffle its barking. She gives it a sharp jab to assert dominance, puppy-training style. It's still making some noise, though, so she decides to put it into the bag of holding to keep it quiet. (This was the point where the more experienced players started grinning, but no one said anything.) Edwin looks around, but Precious is quiet now, so he goes back to sleep.\n\n\nTime passes. The rogue sneaks around and breaks into a chest that turns out to be filled with sewing stuff. (e.g. Needles, thread, and tons of glass beads.) She steals a bunch of these weird magic paint salamanders that Edwin has created, so she gets paint all over her hands. She even sneaks upstairs and steals Edwin's diary. She rolled really high on stealth checks, so she's managing to sneak right around the sleeping party (including the barbarian who owns the bag of holding), but when she comes back to check on the dog in the bag sitting right beside the sleeping party, the barbarian wakes up...\n\n\n...and sees the rogue pulling a dog corpse out of the bag of holding.\n\n\nThe barbarian immediately starts shrieking 'Why is there a dead dog?' (Both in and out of character, since the barbarian's thing is that she loves animals and has been obsessively collecting them for her petting zoo.) So all of the other characters wake up too, and can immediately tell that the rogue has been robbing the place.\n\n\nThe rogue panics and runs away with the dead dog in her arms. She decides she needs to dispose of the evidence, so she runs to this precipice over a waterfall (where the ocean is spilling into this magical hole) and decides to throw the dog down there. The barbarian catches up to her and tries to convince her not to do it.\n\n\nThey debate whether or not to run the dog over with a wagon and pretend that it had just been 'in an accident.' The barbarian is saying stuff like 'I could punch it a little to make it look beat up' and talks the rogue away from the ledge. But the rogue realizes there is no way they can pretend this is an accident, given the dog was behind a locked door in a basement. The barbarian suggests that she could pull an animal out of her bag of tricks and pass it off as Precious, but they pull nothing but badgers and a boar. They decide to bury the dog instead, and then the rogue tries to figure out how to remove this paint that has gotten all over her hands and on the bag of holding, but it's not water-soluble. They end up hiding it by wearing gloves and covering the bag of holding in canvas.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party has pretty much figured out exactly what happened, except the lawful stupid fighter who has sworn to avenge the robbery and find the dog (which Edwin had been dog-sitting for his sister, so he needs to get it back before she finds out.) Edwin is more upset about the dog than anything else taken, aside from the diary.\n\n\nThe ranger notices that the rogue left paint splatters in the dirt outside the house (since she escaped in a hurry), but he covers over it so she doesn't get caught. He finds the rogue, confronts her, demands that she return the diary. He brings it back to Edwin and says that the 'thief got away' but that he 'dropped the diary.' They bond over a discussion of art. The fighter alerts the local guard, but no one is able to track down the thief.\n\n\nThe party regroups and heads on to the next area, but the rogue now is traumatized and has a thousand-yard stare. She finds this weird shaman chick in the next town and tries to convince her to bring the dog back to life, even though resurrection spells are freaking expensive. (She's prone to stabbing people, but this dog is different. She wanted to steal this dog, so she had bonded with it. Or so she claims.)\n\n\nWe ended up breaking for the night and everyone was laughing, even though barely anything really happened and mostly no one got to roll anything (or fight anything).\n\n\nTLDR: The rogue tried to steal from a noble the party was staying with and ended up accidentally killing his dog, Precious, then tried to cover up her crime. The barbarian offers to \"punch it a little\" to make it look like the dog had been run over by a cart.",

        "text": "This story is a continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4eut7i/dd_35e_morons_and_molotovs/).\n\nAfter leaving the bar at the end of the last session, the party decided to investigate this cult, the note they had found was from someone called simply \"M\", so they went to the census bureau where Coraim forged a government official's ID and casted disguise self, turning himself into the most heinous of creatures, a bureaucrat. He then went into the building and asked the receptionist for a list of everyone in the city who's name begins with an M, saying it was a matter of national security (they didn't think about how we'd go through them yet). After a few diplomacy checks the receptionist said he could have it by the end of the day and could give it to Coraim. Now that they had some time to kill, the party decided to find a job to do in the meantime.\n\nCoraim used bardic knowledge to try to find a job, and the party found out that a store in town was recently broken into, and quickly set off to investigate. Upon arriving at the shop they found the shopkeeper cleaning up many broken items, and asked him about what was going on. The shopkeeper explained that his shop had been broken into and that he suspected a competitor was the culprit, and offered to pay the party to investigate. Vido, always looking for a way to fulfill his senseless murder requirement to become an assassin (or asmassin as the group had taken to calling them because of reasons I forgot), asked if the shopkeeper wanted his rival dead if they found out he was the culprit. The shopkeeper was understandably shocked to hear this, but surprisingly said that as long as he wasn't implicated they were free to deal with his rival as we pleased, so we set off towards the other shop for a good investigating (read as murdering).\n\nWhen they arrived at the shop the party began to question the shopkeep, who was visibly shaking as we asked him questions, as well as being quite evasive. Eventually Vido grabbed the shopkeeper by the neck and threatened him with his dagger if he wouldn't say if he was involved with the break-in, but he wouldn't talk, so Iaghar and Vido tried to punch the shopkeeper, both got critical misses and hit a hard surface (such as Iaghar's breastplate), and broke their wrists. Next, Coraim began playing Hello on lute (at this point it had become his signature song for distraction/interrogation). Even when faced with Adele, the shopkeeper maintained that he wasn't involved, but Coraim didn't believe him, so he shot and killed him with a crossbow, then looted and burned his shop.\n\nThe party then returned to the shopkeeper who hired them, who was surprisingly happy with the job they did, at least now he didn't have to worry about break-ins. The shopkeeper payed the party and sent them on their way. They then went to a cleric to fix their broken bones.\n\nIt had been quite a while since Coraim visited the census bureau, but he hadn't rested so he couldn't use disguise self again, so they decided to send Vido in as Coraim's assistant to get the papers. They started forging IDs, but failing repeatedly, at one point they rolled 3 natural 1s in a row, that has a theoretical probability of 0.0125% of happening if I'm correct. Eventually we had to buy more paper, as well as an outfit that looked like that of a bureaucrat. After several tries we made a convincing ID and Vido went down to the census bureau while the rest of the group stayed at the tavern. Coraim's fake name while impersonating the government official was supposed to be Dimble Murnig (names from the Gnome names section of the PHB), but Vido mispronounced it as Dimple Mermaid while speaking with the receptionist. After getting the papers, Vido decided he was going to get his \"murder for no reason\" requirement for becoming an assassin, so he lured the receptionist into his office and shot him in the berries, killing him instantly (I don't understand it either). The screaming of the receptionist as he died from his groin-wound alerted the guards, who went into the room to arrest Vido, who insisted that the man had had a heart attack... which had made a large wound appear on him.\n\nJust then, the rest of the party decided Vido had been gone too long and went to look for him, and found him being arrested. Coraim, posing as Dimble Murnig went up to the guards and showed them his forged ID, and said that the receptionist was actually working for the cult of Orcus, and that the skull dagger had been found on the corpse of one of his associates, and that when Vido was sent to arrest him he resisted and had to be killed. The guards didn't buy it. What Coraim meant to say next was \"we are above the law you incompetent constable\", what he said by mistake was \"we are above the law you impotent constable\", not because of a bad roll, but because Coraim's player said the wrong word while reciting what he would say, and just went with it. the guard quickly got offended, claiming to not be impotent, to which Coraim responded with \"yes you are, I've talked to your wife about it, it's why she wants a divorce\". The guard then asked what a divorce was because it's the middle ages and Coraim explained. Not long after that everyone gave up on diplomacy and the party attacked the guards, killing two, one of which Iaghar tore to pieces with a critical hit with his axe. After a surprise round the party fled, and that's where the session ended on a cliffhanger.\n\n4 dead,\n1 building burned,\n1 manhood insulted,\n2 wrists broken.",

        "text": "So this is a tale that happened last year, around the mid-point. It concerns the Warhammer Fantasy 3rd Edition game, played online via a program called Fantasy Grounds.\n\nI'm only posting this now because someone who I told this to, suggested I post it here. I've hesitated cause there isn't much to tell... It's a short tale about the bizarre actions of perhaps one of the worse game/dungeon masters I've had the displeasure of playing with. \n\nNow, this particular DM who shall remain nameless (to protect his shame, and my shame for having shared a game with him) records his games via audio, and posts the audio blogs up on his website.\n\nI did not join his game from the beginning, as I was in another game at the time. It was around the 8th or 10th session or so when I received an open invitation to join his game, as I had recently left another game. Now, I hesitated as I'm generally not a fan of the 3rd edition Warhammer system, as I much prefer the 2nd edition, plus my experience with 2nd edition is greater as I GM an edition of that Warhammer.\n\nBut alas I was reeling from Warhammer withdrawal, specifically not being part of the universe as a player.\n\nSo I joined the game, and did the first session. I can't say I enjoyed the first session... (or many subsequent sessions after that)\n\nBut it was the second session in which the most bizarre thing I've ever witness take place...\n\nThe GM had forgotten to record the session. He essentially forgot to turn on his audio recording equipment.\n\nHis solution?\n\nTo repeat the whole session. Again. A full retcon of 3 hours. Yep. Collective sighs were had. And although there was general agreement (not that he had given us much of a choice) to do the retcon, frustration could clearly be heard in everyone's voices.\n\nSo we did indeed repeat the whole session. Much fun was had... especially when one of the characters (this session had a hard combat encounter taken place) went down to his wounds, despite the previous session in which he did awesomely well. That player didn't return to the game for the next session.\n\nI wonder why...\n\nSo that is the tale. Short and sweet. A GM who forgot to record the session, and as a result, thought it be a good idea to retcon the full session at the expense of his players just so he can have his audio blog.\n\nOf course, I've continued in his game for awhile (to scratch that WFRP itch) but unfortunately, his ineptitude does not cease there.\n\nNow, I'm normally fine with bad GM's and such. I can forgive and shrug off most things. It's a hard thing to do, and not everyone is cut out for it, so I've got a lot of patience. I'm also not tooting my own horn as a GM, as I know my own flaws (and I may have others not noticed), but for the love of all that is good...Replaying a full 3 hour session just because the GM forgot to turn on his bloody audio equipment?!?\n\nYep, that's a new one...\n\n\n",

After much running around and craziness, we learned we had to go to the unknown Shadow Lands. We suit up, head north, and coerce the wizard guarding the Gate to the Shadow Lands to let us through. The only way to get inside the land is to 1) drink a potion, 2) \"die\" horribly (or quietly, depending on how you rolled - I got a 3), and 3) disintegrate into nothing while our demon companion carries our gear through the Veil (he's the only one who can go through without issue because he came from a similar land). \n\nWe all wake up in a land like the Hell portrayed in \"Constantine\":  sandstorm and nothing but shells of houses littered across the landscape. Everything in this world either wants to eat you or just kill you. Demon leads the party across the wasteland, just guessing where shit is at this point. Not five minutes into our excursion, we get attacked by these mutant human-jaguars with porcupine quill manes. After killing them, Deathshade drops unconscious and begins conversing mentally with this unknown, sarcastic voice. They argue, play 20 Questions, and through a series of insults, Deathshade is renamed \"Moldy Cheese\" due to his \"similar intelligence level\". \"He\" moves on to Ohtar, who is far from smart himself, and the idiot Elf ends up being infamously dubbed \"Wheat-milk\". Fëa is saved for last.....and is quickly dubbed \"Paper\" - a name she accepts with far too much enthusiasm. The night ended with us all awakening in the wizard's courtyard and the man himself declaring that they never left the castle in the first place. And that's not even the end of this story! \n\nTl;dr DM played a Dr. Cox - like NPC who gave names to people who annoyed him and all players are now food or writing material.....and we're not done.",

        "text": "[~Once upon a time...~](https://redd.it/4fbzlr)\n\n...There was a city sitting atop a tiny planet. Or, more like a tiny city-state. It was the greatest and most powerful of all the little towns and settlements, as they cascaded off the top of the little world, and down the sides, like water running off a little ball. Which was a bit funny, because this little city-state filled with humans sat at the source of all the water in the little world, and had just decided that nobody else would get any because they were all horrible monsters.\n\nFor some reason, this didn't go over well.\n\nDown near the bottom of the tiny world, in a forest turned over and grown massive, there was a little town. And in this little town were four chucklefucks- [Nibbit the murder dullahan](http://i.imgur.com/hQGnJ1C.png), [Loki the half-elf liar](http://i.imgur.com/LFK6CyZ.png), [Jello Shot the magic slime](http://i.imgur.com/oNuhhTF.gif), and [Ling Ling the responsible monkey girl](http://i.imgur.com/NvAlD0b.png). And all of them had decided on two things: One, the amount they had pissed off the humans was not nearly enough. Two, they had to get back the water. Also, three, a drunken tengu had just fallen out of the treetops and impacted into their roof and was now loudly snoring.\n\nAll that settled, they decided to follow their new friend's example, got shitfaced, then plotted how they were going to blow up a futhermucking dam halfway across the planet.\n\nStep 1: Get there. This was a problem, as some members of the party (IE jello shot) both moved extremely slowly and were not capable of riding in convenient vehicles. The solution involved Ling Ling's pet hippogriff, an acid-proof bag of holding, and a very long straw.\n\nStep 2: Infiltrate. The dam in question was behind a large wall, constantly guarded by xenophobic humans with orders to SHOOT ON SIGHT. Their plan was to validate those orders by climbing up the wall with Jello Shot, then murdering everyone on the top before they could raise the alarm.\n\nStep 3: Fuck shit up. The general plan was to find the dam, aim Jello Shot and Nibbit at it, then watch the fireworks. Popcorn optional.\n\nStep 4: Clever getaway. An escape doesn't have to be stealthy, so they were going to be relying on Ling Ling's hippogriff for that one. Stationed at a safe distance until needed, of course.\n\nThat settled, they set about enacting it. Travel went smoothly enough (though the hippogriff got a bit crowded), and before they knew it, they were at the base of the wall under cover of night. Asra, the tengu ninja and guest star party member, had her time to shine when she scampered on up and decapitated a man before he knew what hit him. The rest of the party followed by riding Jello Shot, still half-inside the bag of holding, looking like a godawful snail/hermit crab being ridden by a gang of unruly and rather smelly adventurers. Reaching the top unmolested, the unruly elements (Nibbit and Jello Shot) were unceremoniously stuffed back in the bag so team sneaky (Loki and Asra) could have a bit of fun.\n\nFive minutes of surprise decapitations, slit throats, \"accidental\" falls, and various other fun things later, the party had cleared a portion of the wall and had a solid escape route. They also had a new name for their wonderful bag of holding- the Murderbag. Directions for use: Place over victim's head, allow Nibbit and Jello Shot to engulf/woodchipperify the victim, then collect the loot. Next step: Find and destroy the dam.\n\nThey found the dam, all right. And they found that it was pretty heavily guarded. See, Monsters have these funny ideas about sabotaging those dams so that they can have that precious life-giving water, and seeing as there were far fewer dams than miles of giant freaking wall, the humans had placed a lot more guards on the dams.\n\nThose poor bastards.\n\nAsra snuck in under cover of a +30 stealth modifier, while Nibbit was ceremoniously loaded into one of Jello Shot's siege cannons. Did I mention that Nibbit had specifically been taking ranks in Profession: Cannonball? Because he totally had. Nibbit hit the guards witht he force of a wrecking ball, except that this wrecking ball was weilding an enormous axe, was pissed off, and had been previously assured that all of the guards were named Lawrence. He also may or may not have been on fire. Before the alarm had been raised, Asra had turned several unfortunate guards into piles of limbs and filled the area with smoke. Loki assisted through the strategic application of stun batons to necks, Jello Shot fired cannonball after cannonball into the dam, and Nibbit Nibbited as hard he could possibly Nibbit. There was just one problem.\n\nAnd that problem was an enemy caster that had been blasted clear of the dam during the opening volley. He had been taken tossed around like a ragdoll during the initial chaos, but quickly rallied and started casting spell after spell. Fireball! Lightning bolt! Invisibility! The caster made himself a nuisance to the party, nearly killing Jello Shot at one point, before Nibbit charged in and knocked him on his ass, then greased his ass so that he couldn't get up again. Then, while he was flailing around Jello Shot took careful aim and turned him into a piece of modern art. Asra, having never lost stealth due to hanging out in a smoke butt, finished off the last few guards and congratulated herself on a job well done. With one final bit of ceremony, Jello Shot took careful aim and turned the mangled dam into a butt of splinters.\n\nWhich was when reinforcements arrived. See, the guards hadn't spent all of their time dying pointlessly (although there was certainly plenty of that). They had also fired off a distress signal after the first cannon shot, and now the Human Strike Force was bearing down on the party. The party, which was about level 5 by that point, watched in horror as an entire platoon of level 10 grizzled badasses bearing magic weapons and nasty spells started charging toward their position.\n\nIn short: TIME TO GO.\n\nLing Ling swooped down from her perch on her hippogriff, landing in a little safe area that the guards hadn't secured yet. The party made a mad dash as the humans closed in, firing guns and bows and spells (both the party and the humans). But the humans were tricky, and had a lot of nasty surprises- like walls of force as prepared actions, magic missiles, bullet wards, and lots and lots of mage armor. The party was hilariously outclassed, and only managed their escape because of the wonders of the Murderbag. Their cunning escape just edged out the angry retaliations of the murdered guards' friends, and everyone made a clean break! Mission accomplished, the water is flowing!\n\nThere was just one problem with the situation: the dam that the party had demolished was on the HUMAN side of a giant fuckoff wall. Also, the humans had casters out the ass. By the time the party had made their triumphant return, the dam had been rebuilt ten times stronger.\n\nDamn.\n\nAt least the entire party had gotten exorbitantly large bounties placed on their heads! Like, even moreso than they had before! They'd doubled, or even tripled! Man, bounty hunters would be coming out of the woodwork for them. Great work, guys!\n\n&gt; ASRA: \"I get very, very drunk.\"\n\n[NEXT EPISODE!](https://redd.it/4gus95)",

        "text": "   In my first year of university I found myself in a DnD group of all new players. While we all had a lot of enthusiasm, we were not totally clear on all the ins and out of DnD, which lead this period to be filled with wild plots and somewhat bizarre characters. This is the story of Ray.\n\n   Our fairly typical group of adventurous persons (including a ranger, fighter, rogues, and sorceress) were given very little in the way of direction from our DM except for a hook to find some magical McGuffin, apparently for greed's sake. This lead to time spent on the road looking for leads and clues trying to piece information together. One excursion involved freeing slaves being transported on a covered wagon by an old blind man named Ray. A perception check and a roll from behind the DM screen meant our group believed that this blind, timid slave trader who was surrendering to us was not to be trifled with, and could apparently dispatch us all without a problem. Being level 2, and being a fairly cooperative group, it was decided we should keep him around. His covered cart became our mobile base (referred to as the Ruckus), and because of my pointed questions to the only available NPC, Ray became a sort of voice of the DM; a simple way to guide the group to story driving actions. \n\n   A few peculiar aspects came up around Ray, like how he always knew exactly what we should be doing, going beyond the regular voice of the DM. This came out in ways like how to disarm complex traps, the nature of specific demons, or the political conflicts afflicting our employer. Ray also seemed to be incredibly tanky and very patient, even when our fire elemental sorceress spent most of her free time branding him he would just sit there and take it. I offered him potions and healing, but he would seemingly shrug it all off. Most importantly, Ray was completely blind, yet we still let him drive the cart around because he seemed more than capable of doing so. At some point it became apparent that Ray was acting more and more like a camp counsellor for the criminally insane, and was taking care us of, not the other was around.\n\n   Eventually all our leads led us to a dilapidated shack by the side of the road. Ray flatly refused to get too close to it. Numerous attempts at infiltration and exploration of the shack lead to many PCs losing health and sanity to traps, mostly because being new players. We mostly all split up, and resulting in us in over our heads, isolated and alone. This place was a nightmare. Ghastly nosferatu looking guys lurking around corners, doors opening and closing themselves, secret passageways,  looping hallways, and my ranger wound up grappled by the lead demon/vampire. I had to make my escape by throwing myself bodily out of a sunlit window. It was decided that whatever we were looking for in the decrepit house was not worth any of the trouble. So, at our Sorceress' suggestion, we tried to just burn the whole place down. This was met with the discovery that the house was 100% resistant to damage of any kind. Truly, we had exhausted every avenue.\n\n   We decided to take a trip back to town to refresh our supplies and have a breather, but were disappointed to learn from Ray that my ranger had become cursed (and was no longer welcome to ride on the cart). Most of the party spent time researching the demon-things and the house no one like to talk about, while I went to the temple to see about getting that fixed. For the record, the temple was staffed by a single priest, so when I asked to see a priest of the Raven Queen, I was witness to the same priest wheeling out a rack of robes and he simply did a wardrobe change and asked, \"What seems to be the problem?\" Me and my accursed flesh were thrown out of the Temple, on the grounds of contagious curses. With the knowledge gained from the others at the local library and a thirst for vengeance, the party headed back to shack hoping to end things once and for all (hastened by the implication that my curse would probably end up spreading). \n\n   We entered the shack, bypassing the traps we already knew about and fighting the demons en masse, as they seemed to be aware of our mission now, and could quickly see we were prepared this time. Flipping the right switches, opening the right secret passage, and entering the inner sanctum, we were on a mission. Yet it was around here that we realized that we were well and truly fucked, as we came face to face with three level 8 greater-demon-things, and while our level 2 characters outnumbered them, we had almost no confidence in our chances of survival, let alone victory. This proved to be a pretty decent assessment, as within 2 turns our whole party became bloodied. In a fit of desperation, our fighter made a break for the exit, hoping beyond all hope that the blind old man who drove us around might have some way out of this mess. \n\n   Ray sighed, seeing a gore-soaked level two fighter in front of him, begging for salvation. Ray reached under his seat and pulled out a simple mace, and walked straight to the fight, apparently needing no direction from our bewildered fighter. Ray found us, having spent all our turns trying to stay up long enough for reinforcements. Our original assessment of Ray turned out to not be a failed perception check as we always suspected, as Ray was in fact a level 30 cleric of Pelor. Within 3 turns he had healed those of us dying, and single handily slew all three greater demons, AND destroyed the cursed magical McGuffin that caused this whole mess. We were dumbfounded, and Ray explained that he drove us around because taking care of a band of new adventurers equates to shits and giggles for an epic level old man. Unsure of how to proceed, our rogues had the right initiative and lead the process of stripping ever piece of wealth from the premises. We stepped out of the empty, no longer magically-possessed house, loot in hand and saw our old friend and guide, Ray quietly waiting for us on the cart, no thought for gold or compensation.  Seeing this, the more morally minded characters hatched an idea. \n\n   We returned to town, laden with gold, and spent it all at the fantasy \"Home Hardware\" equivalent, and bought supplies. We returned to the house, under the guise of turning the impervious manner into a fortress, and started what can only be described as Extreme Makeover: Dungeon Edition. We excitedly stood Ray up on one side of the Ruckus, and screamed for the driver to \"MOVE THAT WAGON!\"\n\n   When Ray asked us what was happening, we remembered that despite being a top tier ass-kicker he was still blind. So we walked with him to house to run his hands over the works, and to present a new magical mansion for our MVDMPC (most valuable DM played character). The old man was brought to tears at \"the kindness you youngins would show to an old slaver like me (times were tough, jobs were scarce.)\"\n\n   As far as we all know, there a powerful, kindly, old, former-slaver, cleric in those woods. He's living out his remaining days in a mansion, waiting for some old friends to drop back in like they promised, to thank the old codger for everything he did for them\n",

Me.\n  \n  \nAlongside the PC's we had a couple of followers with us.  \n\n* Uriel - Celena's loyal Succubus.   \n* Briar - Our benefactor and quest giver, there to do the technical stuff.  \n* Jake - A pirate, he got drunk and got lost before he could be of any use.    \n  \n\n***\n\nOur party had been tasked with gathering seven shards of a crystal which when gathered and activated would summon a genie and allow the users to make a wish. In our game we had a BigBad called Galareon who was nigh-impossible to kill, so the party had taken it upon ourselves to wish him out of existence.   \n  \nOur party reached the spot where the crystal had to be assembled, and the BigBad shows up, with minions in tow. A battle ensued where the party was trying to hold out long enough so Briar could assemble the crystal and activate it.   \n  \nThe battle was a difficult one, both M'aiq and Almast almost died quite early on. Almast healed himself while Celena tended to M'aiq's wounds. After some time, we had eliminated the BigBad's minions, and the crystal was activating. Due to some well timed spells most of the party had been muted. Only Lorence and Celena could still talk, and therefore use the wish. Celena made her way to the stone just as the Genie appeared. The party was rooting for Celena to end the BigBad's life and to word it as precisely as possible.   \n   \n**\"What is your wish?\"**  \n   \nThe Genie spoke. Celena paused for a second, choosing her words carefully.  \n  \n  \n\"In this room there is a Tiefling Artificer  named Galareon, he has killed many people and taken their souls to use as his power....\"\n\nHere she paused again and the party held their breath.\n\n\"I wish to equal his power, and become a Lich.\"\n\nThe GM just smiled, as he was in on the plan. Understandably the party was somewhat shocked. After their shock wore off it was back to the game.  \n  \n\"Celena, use your new power to defeat him.\"  \n  \nLorence called to Celena, hoping that i'd use my new power to help.\n  \nThen came the second betrayal, Celena activated her Getaway Boots and teleported back to the City where we all came from, several hours away. Uriel followed suit, and Galareon likewise disappeared.  \n\nThe party was left alone, and cursing Celena's name. They had learnt the valuble lesson, that you should probably never trust an Antipaladin.  \n  \n***  \n\n  \nThe next session will likely be the last our party sees. One way or another.  \n  \n",

        "text": "**The continued tale of Malaney Belrue.** [Click here for previous chapter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4eddjh/dnd_5e_uncertainty_at_its_best_pt_1/)\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n\n\nI managed to irk Bordel yet again. I wish it didn’t bother me so. Sure he’s not my boss, yet I hate that I feel like I’m failing him. It’s rather disconcerting. And it all happened after we managed to get in to see my mother (despite my plans getting distorted). \n\nFirst, in the morning, Kimaris was nothing more than a pre-adolescent boy. Only time will tell if tomorrow he’s younger. Might we have an infant on our hands? But I won’t continue on that. With Kimaris too young to pull off a young prince to the guards, we had Bordel take the lead, Oda giving him a disguise. Yesterday, the folk seemed to be quite drawn to his fine armor he had received from Bahamut. Let alone his deity’s symbols was a huge stand out among this Heironious groveling town.\n\nBordel ended up picking up the role of being sent on behalf of Lord Remus. Kimaris and I were his help of sorts. Then suddenly, as I’m explaining that the facade we were putting on was to help me get in unnoticed, Oda- well, his bird, began to state that I ought to be disguised. My indignation went unnoticed as a mustache was slapped on my face, Fern climbing on the bed to fix my hair into a messy man bun.\n\nIt wasn’t my intention to deceive my mother. I wanted to address her plainly as myself, but if anyone saw it was me, coming for her, she would have denied my entry. Let alone, stealing the journals would be cruel, though not impossible. But like I said, my protest and reasoning was ignored. So I pressed it no further.\n\nOn the way out of the Inn, we had a Copper Dragonborn stop us. He was... direct, seeming to know us and on errand for his God. I was too impatient to get my meeting with my mother over with that I insisted that we all kept moving. Fern was already on her way under the guise of a renovator via my brother, Baiden. I didn’t want her there too long without us, so Bordel offered the Dragonborn, Aragoth, to come along. I almost was reluctant about the invitation, but I held my tongue as I realized the ease in which I could hide behind the man.\n\nSoon the four of us, and Fern (she was fixing one of the tapestries in the Library), were standing before my mother, Laeni Belrue. Bordel did well in addressing her, but as he began to walk away with her, I couldn’t keep my tongue quiet. I had to be up front and honest with her.\n\n“Mother,” I called out. My eyes were hard set on her as I felt everyone else’s lock on me. I pulled the disguise from my face and let my hair down. I must have looked ghastly in the men's fashion, and it did little to my nerves to be in such deceptive clothes.\n\nAs I predicted, my mother was livid to have me in her presents. She asked the four of us gathered (Fern ‘not’ having any part with our gathering) to leave. I insisted that we would go after retrieving my father’s journals.\n\n“You dare return and ask for his journals!?” she shrieked, “I will not let you defile his memory!”\n\nI attempted to explain that a third party might have been involved in Theedain’s death, of which we may find out if we were allowed to read the journals. Laeni then went on to assume I had chosen a life of murder! “So that’s the life you’ve chosen,” her conceited voice rang. She even dared to bring Heironious into it, reminding me that He was watching. Hating how inferior she was trying to make me, I held my head high and asked if she knew of the Primordials. Of course she didn’t and so I declared, “It is who we are and if you only know the holy stature we bear you would tremble with the lack of respect you’ve given us!”\n\nWith that, my mother insisted we leave at once. In defense of my party, hoping that maybe they’d be able to better persuade Laeni in my absence, I dismissed myself. \n\nFor a moment, I thought Bordel sympathized with me. He called my mother out for being ‘righteous’. I had stopped to listen, but dared not look. He defended my name that Laeni tried to slander. Bordel then asked once more for the journals. Of course he was denied. He then placed upon my mother’s shoulders any and all responsibility for the deaths that come as a result of her refusal. If the journals contain any evidence, any name, to what could be my father’s murderers, her withholding them from us would put the blood on her hands.\n\nI almost thought Bordel’s words would have done it, would have broken the stiff pride Laeni was all too well known for by her bitter enemies, but alas she reminded us to leave.\n\nKimaris did attempt to make a dash for the office. I had mentioned to the group where they were as we plotted our options to obtaining the books. I tried to tell him to stop, but the boy ignored me. I wasn’t terribly worried. A few minutes later the guards escorted the young boy out as I predicted.\n\nThe walk back was met with many surprised voices, all wanting an explanation of what I had done. I reminded them that it wasn’t my intention from the start to steal the journals. The goal was to get me in. Bordel in a huff asked what we were to do now. I simply replied that we’d go to the Head Priest. He’s likely to know of the Primordials and if there was anyone my mother would honor, it would be him. His word might as well be that of Heironious Himself.\n\nBack at the Inn it was even more clear how angry Bordel was with me. We all regrouped, waiting for service at the church to draw nigh, and ate dinner. Fern asked why the Dragonborn was with us. To this, the Human in a bitter voice replied, “Why not Malaney explain since she likes to run off with her mouth?”\n\n I looked at Bordel and was suddenly embarrassed. I hadn’t meant to offend. And suddenly, I felt very unsure of myself. Certainly he feels I blew any chance of us getting the journals, and he’s quite possibly right. Kimaris was sweet and tried to cheer me up, using a similar line to what I told him yesterday, “We all make mistakes.”\n\nWhen the time came for the church service, I was less than enthusiastic to go. I couldn’t guarantee its success, but it was the only other honest means I could fathom to obtain the books.\n\nKimaris and Fern ended up coming with me. Bordel would have, but was caught up by some guards. It would seem the man was an executioner before his time with us. It makes sense considering he worships- or honors the God of Death. I certainly wasn’t going to insist on him staying with.\n\nThe service was a reminder of how much I use to waste my breath. I managed to keep my words to myself. The hour passed and it then was time for confessionals. When my turn came, the Priest was pleasantly surprised. Thankfully he seemed to take my mention of being a Primordial to heart. He said he’d pray about it, and if I was lying, I’d have even more to repent of. I gave a cordial smile and bid him a good night.\n\nI can only hope I persuaded him enough. I would have shown him the feather buds growing in, but then again, I don’t know if that has anything to do with my supremeness. \n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n\nOh goodness. I haven’t a clue what’s wrong with Bordel. He just passed out on the bed... good thing I’m all set up on the floor as it is. Something got him in quite a huff. Whatever it was, I hope it’s nothing serious.",

        "text": "[A long, long time ago, on a tiny little planetoid whizzing through the upper atmosphere, things were quickly going to shit](https://redd.it/4drkwc). Like, faster than usual. Up on the top of the comet, where gravity was normal, there was a perpetual storm that provided the water for all of the comet as it sloshed around and fell off the bottom. So far so good. But then, a bunch of assholes start camping out around the storm, poking around at the riverbeds, and setting up sluice gates. And THEN, those assholes decide that when they don't like you, they just shut off your water. So you go to take it up with them, except you can't, because the assholes have a stranglehold on everyone by virtue of controlling ALL OF THE WATER. And, oh yeah, they have a giant military, a ridiculous amount of resources, and a giant fucking wall between you and the water you desperately need to survive.\n\nMost people call the aforementioned assholes by another name: Humans. Or maybe it was the other way around.\n\nSo there were four chucklefucks, dicking around at the bottom of a small, completely fucking nonsensical planetoid thing. Said chucklefucks consist of [Jello Shot the truly omnivorous slime](http://i.imgur.com/oNuhhTF.gif), [Loki the smooth-talking half-elf](http://i.imgur.com/LFK6CyZ.png), [Nibbit the dullahan fuckbag and bane of all those named Lawrence](http://i.imgur.com/hQGnJ1C.png), and finally [Ling Ling the responsible monkey-girl](http://i.imgur.com/NvAlD0b.png). This lovely party was a bit pissy, because some asshumans had just turned off their water.\n\nNobody felt like spamming Create Water for the next forever, so they set off to file a formal complaint with the asshole humans. Said complaint would likely take the form of Jello Shot firing one of his seige cannons at something that the humans would rather Jello Shot not fire a seige cannon at. But hey, they were trying to be reasonable. Sort of. While also gathering together alchemical bombs, an entire armory of weapons, magical armaments, and let's not forget two giant seige cannons.\n\nThe party set off to have a chat with one of the little human colonies parked just outside the big old wall. It was apparently a happening place to be, because every other group of people that needed water to live (IE: fucking everybody) was also there, and ALSO demanding an answer to the age old question of \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING\". Sadly, most of those complaints were falling on deaf ears. Asking around, they found that the two main mayors/chief-diplomats/whatever of this particular town were a bit flighty and prone to disappear at odd times. Apparently they had gone on vacation or something right before all of humanity decided to piss off the entire rest of the planet.\n\nSo Jello Shot and Nibbit did the only reasonable thing. That's right, Nibbit loaded his cannonball-faced fuckbagness into Jello Shot's seige cannon, and Jello Shot took careful aim at an enormous bell in the center of town, on an old, antique town hall. It was, to use a familiar phrase, something that the humans would rather Jello Shot not fire a seige cannon at. Suffice it to say, this got fucking EVERYONE'S attention as Nibbit crashed into the bell, the support beams holding the bell, the little roof above the bell, and the now-crumbling parapets around the bell. Nibbit then screamed in a horrible demonic monotone that they wanted those two Leadery individuals and Nibbit wanted them fucking NOW. Jello Shot magically amplified this message all around the city, while the bell tower collapsed in a cascade of completely pointless property destruction.\n\nWhich was when Loki ran into an old friend- a powerful [shapeshifter by the name of Shantalotte](https://redd.it/48jeer), who he had some association with (read: massive boner for). Unfortunately, all was not well. Shantalotte had been hiding a small secret about herself: Shantalotte was not her real name. In fact, she didn't know what her real name was. She'd forgotten, because of all the shapeshifting. And just now, she was having a particularly hard time of it, because in the middle of her weekly \"figure-out-who-the-hell-I-am\" session, some lovely folks had come along and started fucking with her head. Illusions, false witnesses, mind magic, isolation, the whole shebang. Shantalotte was, in a few words, flipping her shit. But thankfully, she'd found a familiar face at just the right time in order not to go off the deep end. Finally, someone who recognized her and would help her through this mess!\n\nWhich was when some dickbag popped around the corner and casted [Isolate](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/isolate) on her, completely fucking that little reunion in the head. Well, that wouldn't do, so Ling Ling hurled a bag of glitter at the invisible Shantalotte so they could keep an eye on her while Loki put on his game face and gave chase.\n\nThe chase failed. Apparently pursuing someone indistinct through a crowd of all of the races ever, when you and your friends are the subject of some VERY SERIOUS ATTENTION, means that you don't really have a leg to stand on when trying to hunt someone down. But after things settled, they did find a clear trail that led to an abandoned building. A spooky one! With nothing else to do, the party went on in. Except for Jello Shot, who oozed himself into a very thin line and used himself to encircle the place as a living, well-armed goo barrier in case anyone tried to leave. Everyone else went inside to see what they could find.\n\nAaaaand they quickly became familiar with the wonderful world of traps. every goddamn corridor was trapped. Tesla coils, laser guns, poisoned darts, pits, heavy-duty electromagnets, spikes, rams, fire, and in one case a very amusing teleportation loop. Well the party quickly got sick of that. Loki ditched the \"dismantle\" option, pulled out a gun, and started firing at important-looking mechanisms. Nibbit cut out even THAT step and started hacking his way through the crumbling walls. Ling Ling winced at the reckless damage, until Jello Shot thought he heard something and fired his cannon. While spread very thin. A very heavy cannon, with a lot of recoil. That wasn't a very smart idea, and three rounds later, when Jello Shot managed to find and assemble all his pieces, he had decided that guard duty was stupid.\n\nMeanwhile, during the amusing romp through Trapsville, some shadowy asshat dropped behind the party, cast a Sleep spell on Shantalotte when nobody was looking, and was about to make a cunning escape when Ling Ling wandered back to check up on her friend. Finding no glittery and still-invisible shapeshifter, but very much finding a dangerous-looking spellcaster holding a net and wearing an evil grin, Ling Ling reflexively whipped out her bow and started firing. Wildly. While screaming.\n\nThere was a brief but intense scuffle involving fear effects, illusions, an electrified net, a teleporter mishap, an anti-gravity field, and Jello achieving his dream of being a Lava Lamp shortly before being splattered into twelve distinct pieces (he got better), the party managed to catch the mystery assailants at the last possible moment before they made a getaway. Not ones to take chances, they knocked the mysterious duo out and examined them carefully.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, they had just invaded the home of and assaulted the two Mayor Ladies of the town. But wait, that's not all! During the examination, they discovered that both of the girls had been rigged with suicide vests! WHY!? Now in a blind panic about what in the fuck and why was this happening, the party set about disabling the things as best they could. Which was when a pack of four automatons blasted through the roof and started marching towards the Big Red Buttons on the suicide vests. The party managed to down three out of four of them, and the last one reached out and Pushed The Button.\n\nOn the plus side, now they only had to deal with one prisoner.\n\nThey weren't taking ANY chances with this girl, though. They had Nibbit, who was a walking beacon of Fucking Things Up, deliberately try and \"fix\" the bomb to the best of his ability (by hugging it). Then, the party bound and gagged the unconscious girl, and kept a paranoid watch for any hostiles. Which was when the girl regained consciousness and tried to commit suicide by biting through her tongue. The party only barely noticed in time and managed an incredibly quick-and-dirty solution by slapping a Fire Breath on her. And thus, the day was saved! Sort of. Except for the part where they were all gathered around a beaten and bloody town mayor, having bound and gagged her, scorched the shit out of her mouth, and also the mayor's twin sister was now a fine red mist. Oh yeah, and Nibbit and Jello were personally seen brandishing weapons in the middle of town, destroying public property, and angrily demanding the two people who were now A: dead and B: apparently the subject of some pretty brutal torture, respectively.\n\nSuffice it to say, the party found it necessary to skip town.\n\nOnce at a \"safe\" distance, the party tried and largely failed to figure out just what in the great-flipping-shit-dicks had just happened. A few things were apparent, now that Shantalotte was up and about- the twin mayors had been tormenting Shantalotte for a few days, for unknown reasons. Their motive for doing this was unclear. But, through examination of the facts, it was apparent that the Mayor Ladies were part of something bigger and weirder- SOMEONE had rigged them with suicide vests, and also dropped a bunch of robotic doohickies out of the sky. And wasn't it convenient how the guard had walked in right at the worst possible moment? The party tried to get some hard answers out of their remaining captive, but all they got was more suicide attempts and, when they attempted to read her mind, a neverending rickroll. It was quite clear that neither of the Mayor Ladies had been particularly well in the head.\n\nFilled with unanswered questions, the party elected to return home after dropping off their weird captive somewhere safe. Not seeing any better options, they threw her into the care of the Gnomes they had met previously, on the logic that their extremely fuzzy brand of science might crack the mystery, or at least fail in an amusing manner.\n\nThe next morning, the party discovered three things.\n\n* 1: The humans had taken the loss of the Mayor Ladies rather hard, and shut off ALL OF THE WATER. As a direct result of this and the giant clusterfuck that was the kidnapping of the mayor ladies, the humans were officially declaring war on everyone else on the planet.\n* 2: The party's names and desciptions had been passed around, detailing their crimes, and a VERY SIZEABLE reward for their capture, dead or alive.\n* 3: The monsters and nonhumans had ALSO gotten wind of the entire dealings, assumed that this was some sort of elaborate sabotage, and ALSO posted bounties for the capture of the party.\n\n&gt; LING LING: \"Why.\"\n\n&gt; LOKI: \"Hey, my bounty's lower than everyone else's!\"\n\n&gt; JELLO SHOT: \"EAT BOUNTY HUNTERS!\"\n\n&gt; NIBBIT: \"*Are the bounty hunters named Lawrence?*\"\n\n&gt; LING LING: \"Whyyyyyyyy.\"\n\n[NEXT EPISODE!](https://redd.it/4fri37)",

        "text": "I was GMing a 3.5 dnd campaign, where PCs were to find out who was the Great Evil Mastermind who was behind all crazy-ass assasinations of mages and wizards across the continent. I mean they were insane. Long range crossbow snipes, ultra-rare poisons, etc. We were into a good start, unfortunatelly one of our friends had to stop playing because of personal problems, and he couldn't join our weekly sessions. Instead I decided to make him the Great Evil Mastermind. So his campaign was mostly solo play, but with absurd amounts of precise planning (he loves stragtegy games, so he had a lot of fun), building up forces and intrigues, choosing next targets, while PCs were trying to find out whom he was, and what was his plan.\n\nAfter 10 sessions the great scheme has been discovered, final battle was about to break out. PCs finally tracked down tGEM's hideout, and after 5 most intense hours of fighting in massive underground cave complex and stuff they finally reached their mortal enemy. It's important to mention that two of PCs died because of Evil Mastermind's actions. So they wanted his blood.\n\nIn the meantime our solo friend sorted out his personal life and wanted to resume playing with us. Instead I told him to play the Great Evil Mastermind in the final battle. He agreed, and asked me whom he had to play. \"Oh, whatever. Make it awesome\" - I said, and granted him extra 20 attribute points, so he could make the most overpowered creature he wishes. That was supposed to be that epic final battle. \n\nHe made a gelatinous cube. With 22 inteligence, a bunch of henchmen and traps. The Great Evil Gelationous Cube. He was a magical experiment which went very wrong, and he was casted away by mages of the Circle (a bunch of dickhead power-hungry lich-mages). The fatal experiment made the cube conscious, magical and extremely intelligent. So he decided to retaliate, and destroy those who hurt him.\n\nAs you might think, PCs went crazy. And so did I. And it was the most dissapointing final battle I've ever seen. The Great Evil Cube was bludgeoned to death by angry PCs, because he was too immobile to run away...\n\n",
