        "text": " \n\nThis has been bugging me for a few months... trying to figure out what their game is. Here's what I think is happening:\n\nMost of us order the same things over and over without paying much attention. Walmart has changed their online grocery ordering and delivery substitution from \"equivalent product at same or lower price\" to \"we'll give you what we want and charge you full price\". If they make substitutions, they email me. typically I only have 1 hour or less to change/decline a substitution... The email comes at random times - presumably whenever they complete the shopping. If ordering ahead this email ca n come at 3am. This recently resulted in a $12 soda purchase (6 x 2 liter bottles that were on sale) costing over $30 when they substituted full-price 12 pack cans for bottles.\n\nMake certain if you use this service you disable all substitutions at checkout.\n\nBut, I digress.\n\ni've been downvoted a fair amount recently for ripping on Walmart. I used to recommend their store brands and the Walmart+ service to everyone. I live where I do because it's a quick 10 minute trip on my mobility scooter to Walmart and even though rent was higher, overall, it was c heaper. Here's an example of something that might slip by:\n\n$18.50 for a 24oz bottle of Aunt Jemima syrup (this is $4.59 at Harris teeter) . I tried to post a link but the bot blocked my post because of it. You'll have to search for it yourself.\n\nI'm not going to get into anything chicken related as it's crazy everywhere. I will however say: If you are going to buy chicken anywhere, buy it in person. Last time we looked at \"fresh\" chicken in Walmart, it was so rotten that we were retching into the clear bags from the smell in the air.\n\nOver the next week, I'll be taking 5-10 hours to compare prices of our top 70 or so items vs a year ago and vs other stores in the area. I'll try to remember to grab screenshots of the spreadsheet.\n\nMaking the list and looking at the prices paid in December vs my (admittedly, not the best) memory, I'm expecting to see that our Walmart grocery cost has increased 20-40% (again, not including chicken products).\n\nFYI: Inflation for 2022 was around 7-8%, depending how it's calculated. Social security/disability increased 8.7% - Before anyone runs off thinking we are rich (frankly, I'm tired of hearing it), it's a year behind. You think we had it tough before? that 8.7% needs to cover our 20% increase in rent, the nearly 40% increase in some utilities, with our monthly gas bill increasing over 200% LAST YEAR. Speaking of gas... well, let's just not.\n\nANYway, I'd be real interested to hear what others are seeing wrt OVERALL grocery prices and comparisons between chains. In these parts, we have Walmart, Target, Harris Teeter, Lowes Foods, and Publix. (Wegmans and Whole foods is around as well, but way too far away and way out of our income bracket.",

Wild caught shrimp less then 15ct per lb is $8 also. Loaded up on 6 lbs of that. Usually runs $12 or more for the extra large shrimp like that in my area. I also have 5 choice rib roasts all picked up under $6lb. If you know anything about ribeyes you know your basically paying $12+lb these days and easily $16lb or more if your getting restaurant thick cuts (regionally slight differences).

So husband and I have switched to dining only at counter service restaurants when we go out. We usually still tip a few dollars at a counter service, but its definitely not required and not nearly as much as 20%.\n\nUnlike restaurants who only pay their servers a server wage (the federal minimum server wage is $2.13), counter service restaurants (the ones where you order at the counter and get your own drink) are required to pay at least the regular minimum wage (federal minimum wage $7.25). \n\nI personally enjoy the vibe of counter service restaurants a lot better, its a lot more frugal, and it is an ethical way to avoid supporting the tipping system without taking it out on servers by not tipping (which you should never do). \n\nJust an idea for the frugal people who like to eat out.",

I went in and saw containers of buttery cookies stack neatly calling out to any customers that enters the store. Upon closer inspection, it costs 7 dollars! I myself bake cookies and immediately did some mental calculation and arrive at a cost price of 1 dollar per container (excluding labor costs). \n\nI cannot imagine a store would mark up 7 times the price but it also give me the confidence of selling my cookies at a lower price and it also tastes better. Any tips in marketing? I’m just going to bake at home and sell. Save on rental and can pass the costs saving to customers.",

There was one small lower cabinet next to the sink that we measured and it was just big enough to fit an 18” apartment sized dishwasher.

For example, I need a particular brand of cheese to make cloud bread, I’m celiac, which can be expensive. The cheapest place to buy it is Sams so a large chunk. I have had half of one in the fridge for 6 months without mold. ( I can’t stand cheese that has been frozen.) Same thing with more delicate cheeses like queso fresco which goes bad ridiculously quick. It has 4 different settings so it doesn’t just squish things. Also, just a seal option if you don’t want to take the air completely out. \n\nIf something is too smushy, like raspberries, you just freeze them on a sheet pan first.\n\nFood takes less room and the bags are easy to write on, too. I’ve even vacuum sealed shepherds pie IN it’s casserole dish!\n\nIt will pay for itself quickly and the bags are super cheap on Amazon.

        "author": "AccidentalFIRE",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/zzwkwn/12_years_post_early_retirement_frugal_living/",
        "text": " This will be cross posted in a few early retirement related reddits, so if you see it somewhere else, nothing is different. Some people ask why I post in frugal with some of the bigger numbers you'll see...so a bit of a spoiler up front...my non business/non investment spending this year was under $15k, and most years in the recent past was well under $10k. Just skip to the expenses section if you don't want to see the income side of things. \n\nI always begin these updates with the same disclaimer that I don't have a specific FIRE date since I was self employed before retirement and slowly dissolved my business over time and started investing in real estate. I use the 2010 time frame for reference because it is around the time I hired a property manager (thus leaving me zero active work to do unless I choose), but it certainly isn't exact.\n\nThis isn't meant as a comparison to anyone else. This is strictly provided to the FIRE community because I know I would have liked to have seen real world example of how people handle their finances when I was trying to figure all this out many years ago. Another reason I post these is to show there is more than one way to do FIRE. I was able to accomplish this without ever making a high income during my working years. I simply lived very frugally and put the money I saved into individual stocks (hey, it was 80s - 90s...I didn't know better and stock investing was a completely different animal back then) and then converted that to buying rental properties in a low cost of living area in the 2000s.\n\nQuick stats: I'm 57, single, no kid's, about 12 years post FIRE.\n\n**WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE MY LAST UPDATE**\n\nLast update had some major changes, but not so much this time other than a few book keeping notes to tidy up some math.\n\nHad just bought a new car in the last update, a 2022 Hybrid Elantra, and had planned to pay it off in cash after getting the financing rebate. Right before the payoff I found out a roof needed repair and I wasn't going to be able to cash flow it without a margin loan against my stock that would be much higher than the car loan at 2.75%, so I decided to keep it. 4 roofs later, I still have the loan, lol. The car IS so far doing as expected and getting me over the 60mpg I planned. The gas savings combined with the 10 year bumper to bumper warranty SHOULD result in an overall savings vs. gas and repairs to my previous drivers. Most of those are collector cars, so I'll be selling them off to help pay the expense of the new car. Anyway, that is about $650 per month on a 4 year loan. So that will be reflected in my financials now.\n\nThe house cleaner mentioned previously moved away...and I haven't bothered to replace her.\n\nI've continued to grow the real estate business, with several new projects now in the works keeping my team busy...while I sit around and enjoy the retired life, lol. In fairness, I do look at potential houses in person and discuss what I want done with my team, but after that I rarely have any hands on involvement outside of the rare big picture decision.\n\n**INCOME**\n\nNet income for the year from all income streams after all expenses is right at $143,000 This is mostly rental income with some dividends (about $15,000) thrown in.\n\n**GROWTH AND NET WORTH**\n\nMy growth in my investments so far this year. Keep in mind this numbers reflect the sharp downturn in the markets.\n\nTotal invested this year $132,000. (Yes, that left me $11,000 to live on. That will be addressed below)\n\nBecause I hold some long term leverage in stocks, it was pretty brutal this year, and I lost a total of just shy of $275,000 in the stock market. Leaving me with a stock balance of right at $364,000. Luckily my other investments did well and continued to grow.\n\nFundrise account grew about $8200 in appreciation for a return of right at 9.3% and leaving a balance of right at $109,000 (I know that math looks strange, but I invested $24K throughout the year)...and that should get better at the final adjustments are not yet in for the last quarter.\n\nMy real estate (rentals) is very difficult to estimate since I have partners on some of the houses and some I own outright. Not to mention it isn't a liquid asset. I usually just judge it by the income it produces...that being said it does have a value that adds to my net worth. I'll be conservative and say my real estate portfolio is worth $2M - $2.5M. I do not hold debt on the portfolio. Everything is owned outright without loans of any sort. This includes some sharp increases in property values over the past couple of years. I don't think it has changed substantially since the last update.\n\nMy personal property (the house and 10 acres of land I live on) is worth about $450k - $500k...again as a conservative estimate. A house similar to mine, but in my opinion not quite as appealing, recently sold for over $750,000.\n\nI have misc. accounts totaling around $45K...this is a small Acorn account, another stock account I use for experiments in investing, and my liquid accounts that I use for personal and business expenses. I keep more in a \"cash\" bank account than most because I need to cover business expenses. I try to keep around $20K in there, but it will fluctuate greatly throughout the month to as low as $7 or 8K, to sometimes as high as $30k. I currently have another $4k in a money market fund. I have this for quick liquidity when needed. This also varies greatly and will be as high as $50K at times.\n\nNot going to bother with my cars and other misc. on this update. This brings my total net worth as of this update to around $3,000,000 (using the conservative estimates above)- $3,500,000. So, stocks are down since last update, real estate is about even, so when you account for the money invested my net worth is down slightly since the last update, but not substantially.\n\n**EXPENSES**\n\nI spent a total average of $672 per month on all non business related expenses in the first half of the year. The car about doubled it in the last half of the year. This came in over my previous goal of $10K per year with total spent on typical stuff at $11,245. In late October I was hiking near Eureka Springs, AR and found a cat quite literally on her death bed. Skin and bones...too weak to even really move. So I decided to try to save her if I could. Right now she is still alive, and has about $3000 in vet bills and counting. So....that brings my total spent this year to $14,245 and far exceeds my non investment spending in previous years of retirement.\n\nThese numbers are updated to reflect the current expenses, even though these are some fairly recent changes.\n\nPhone/Internet $25 (Visible wireless with unlimited hotspot for internet)\n\nInsurance on my cars $125 (3 cars liability only, 1 full coverage)\n\nFood/groceries $100 (I've done some detailed food budget breakdowns if you're curious how I keep this so low)\n\nElectric $125 - $150 (average throughout the year/ all electric house)\n\nI have my own well and septic tank, so no bills for water, sewerage, and trash. I'm low waste, so just take a small bag (plastic grocery size) with me to town and use public trash cans in front of the stores I go to town about every 2 weeks.\n\nGas for cars $25 - $50. I spent quite a bit more on gas in the last few months before buying the hybrid, so my gas budget went up quite a bit. It was about $100 - $150 before buying the hybrid. This is mainly due to looking at more houses for the business, semi local trips for hiking/and or entertainment. (everything within 100 miles, but it does add up)\n\nEntertainment $100. I hate to give this it's own line in the budget, but I do sometimes spend on entertainment, so although this is no way a true reflection of what I spent last year, I am including it because everyone asks, lol. Most of my entertainment ends up being \"free\" or nearly free other than the gas it takes to go places. Last year my out of pocket on entertainment was probably about $300 for a season pass to Silver Dollar City, and several cave tours with a friend from out of town. Other than that it was mostly gas to get to some fun hiking spots.\n\nHealth Insurance is a free (for now) catastrophic plan. Thanks to all my real estate deductions I get to write off most of my income, leaving me just able to qualify for the absolute worst plan available in my state for free. Of course, if one little thing goes wrong at tax time and I step over the threshold at the end of the year, that could change and I'll be left paying for a plan I've never used.\n\nI think next year I'll be looking at about $15,000 goal for total spent if I don't take on another cat on her deathbed...or if this one doesn't cost me another $5k.\n\nI think that covers where things are now.\n\n**WHY DON'T I SPEND MORE?**\n\nI started including this section because I was asked about it so much. Same as last update, so nothing new here.\n\nI get asked this a lot. Why am I still trying to accumulate wealth 10 + years after I retired? Well, I'm still relatively young, and I have some big future goals that includes a large animal sanctuary with its own vet clinic and vegan restaurant. Even though I already have about 40 acres lined up for it, it is going to take a long time to get all the infrastructure in place. It might be 5 -10 years before it actually opens. I'm hoping to build as much as I can in the meantime.\n\nI'm also just frugal by nature. Most of the stuff I enjoy is free or nearly free. Hiking trails, video games, TV, movies, diving down rabbit holes of whatever interest me at the time, etc. Some of my hobbies even make me money. I've managed to buy cars that appreciate. I happen to be a decent poker player. My watches have done really well...same with my art collection.\n\nI don't live like a pauper. I live alone in a 4000 sq ft Mid Century house built into a cliff overlooking a river and beautiful valley with an indoor pool...so don't think my frugality always comes at the cost of the finer things. It is true until I recently bought my dream house I lived in a very modest house most people wouldn't associate with a millionaire (that house now rents for $750 a month), but I was patient and wanted to find the perfect house before I bothered to move. As I briefly mentioned before I have nice things like collector cars, art, watches, etc....I just try to spend as little as possible on depreciating assets or things like food. I appreciate good food, but being vegan makes it hard to eat out in my area. That is probably an understatement. There are maybe a handful of places I can eat at all (at least with more than salad as an option), and most of those only have one or two items on the menu I can eat. So I'd rather prepare great meals at home from cheap ingredients. I've gone into details in other posts about how I shop and prepare food, so won't make this post any longer doing it again.\n\nAs always, I'll try to answer any questions you might have. Thanks for reading such a long post!!",

        "text": "Anyone else find more satisfaction in spending money on loved ones/friends than it is on yourself?\n\nFor the last 2-3 years, I've employed every tip in the book when it comes to living frugally while alone. As a university student, I get about $400 per month in allowances and scholarships, so I track every penny meticulously on a budgeting app. I meal prep the same $1 pasta/rice meals to eat every day and eat out less than once a month, ride my bicycle to class, don't buy new clothes, use a 7-year-old iPad for class and daily drive a 4-year-old sub-$200 hand-me-down Android smartphone with no plans to upgrade until security patches stop coming. My parents (who help pay for my rent) have even told me that I need to 'love myself more' by not being too frugal, but it just doesn't feel like splurging on myself will change my life much.\n\nIronically, I've perhaps been overly generous with the people I care about. I won't hesitate to buy gifts/flowers for my girlfriend 'just because' or paying for people's meals when I ask them out for lunch (usually old friends a few times a year). In the next couple months, I plan on buying my younger sister a new $500 laptop to replace her old one from 2015, and I'm also helping my girlfriend top up the $200 difference between the iPhone 14 and a 14 Pro so she can get the latter as she upgrades from an old iPhone 8.\n\nFinancially, I'll be paying for these devices with cash from many months of saving, and I've done plenty of research to make sure to get the most value (as though I'm buying it for myself). Difference is, for this (or any given) monetary amount, I don't even blink when someone I care about expresses a want that I can afford, yet I would contemplate again and again if I was spending it on myself, probably convincing myself against it.\n\nJust want to make sure I'm able to find a healthy balance and not going too far in either direction.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWhat a year it’s been! Whether you’re new to the community or have been a contributor for some time, welcome! This is a space to generate discussions about the community, post your frugal New Years resolutions coming into 2023, updates, tips/tricks, or anything else!\n\n\\---\n\n**Important Links**\n\nFull subreddit rules here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/about/rules/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/about/rules/)\n\nOfficial subreddit Discord link here: [https://discord.gg/W6a2yvac2h/](https://discord.gg/W6a2yvac2h/) \n\n\\---\n\n**Community Updates**\n\nTo begin, I would like to announce that u/Hopeful_Optimism has chosen to step down from their role as the head moderator of r/Frugal. They took over from u/Vorokar last year and have genuinely helped make a positive impact. No matter if the work was public or behind the scenes, they have kept things in check and made certain the ship was running straight. While they will remain on the moderation team in a reduced role, we collectively wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the great work Hopeful has done and the dedication they have shown to our community.\n\nLooking forward, various updates and changes have been proposed or are planned:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Frugal Finds Friday: Rule 7 would be suspended on Fridays, providing an opportunity for users to share photos and stories of their finds or hauls outside the traditional megathread.\n* Various backend updates and changes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis thread also serves as an opportunity to provide community feedback to these ideas. Please let us know if you have any suggestions!\n\n\\---\n\n**A Year In Review**\n\n2022 was a year of growth for r/Frugal!
