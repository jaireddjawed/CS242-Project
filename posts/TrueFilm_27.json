        "text": "By 'right-leaning' I don't mean Michael Bayisms. I mean films with actual artistic merit that have themes of ideals commonly associated with the right.\n\nFrench New Wave comes to mind, but perhaps that was down to its ostensibly apolitical nature more than any anti-left leanings. The politics of the status quo. \n\nSicario 2 got me thinking recently. It's a poor, albeit very well-put together film that pales in comparison to the first, which was rather decent.  It's undoubtedly right-leaning though. This alone doesn't make it a poor film, but the fact Sheridan's moral equivocation towards US policy seems to have deserted him as soon as Obama left office, together with the newfound ambivalence towards US actions depicted in the sequal, is regrettable. I actually wouldn't mind an attempt to defend these policies*, but Sheridan never wants to commit to it and the result ia a fudge that doesn't actually say anything. The film has other glaring problems in terms of writing, narrative and plot, of course.\n\n\nBut what are the *good* right-wing films of recent times?\n\n edit: Don't read that as *support* for the US War on Drugs.",

        "author": "CineRanter-YTchannel",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8xqdr6/whats_with_all_the_hybrid_plots_in_blockbusters/",
        "text": "I noticed a trend that seems to be steadily growing traction with blockbusters starting to make films with 'hybrid' versions of classic bad-guys (e.g. Jurassic World, the new Predator movie) so I made a video essay called “What’s with all the Hybrids in Movies Today?” discussing the reason for this which you can find here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsqeBsj4EWw\n\nIf you prefer to read the transcript is written below.\n\nTL;DR – I believe the influx of hybrid plotlines is less of a problem in of itself and more of an exposé on how creatively bankrupt studios have become.\n\nFull transcript:\n\nI was flabbergasted when Jurassic World introduced the idea that children were becoming bored of seeing Dinosaurs and thus the scientists were pushed into making a hybrid dinosaur. Granted, it’s an interesting idea, having Dinosaurs becoming the norm to such an extent that no one finds them interesting anymore. It’s akin to people in the west hearing all sorts of fantastic stories about elephants and lions in Africa and Asia in the old days, and now we’re at a stage where we have both in zoos just a couple of miles away from our homes and can access videos featuring them on TV and on our phones, right in our very hands.\n\nStill though, these are prehistoric, titanic, 12 meter high man eaters, not lions and tigers and bears. And there’s so many different dinosaurs that have yet to feature in the Jurassic Park movies. It’s a difficult premise to swallow that kids don’t care about dinosaurs anymore, but even if they did, splicing multiple dinosaurs into one creation seems to out there. Despite Jurassic Park being rooted in scientific fantasy, the whole “creating a hybrid out of multiple dinosaurs” is too schlocky and if anything, suggests the film makers themselves think movie audiences will find your standard T Rexs boring and needs to create a Frankenstein-saurus to get those beloved ticket sales. And anyway, isn’t the dna of Dinosuars in the JP movies mentioned as being incomplete, and the scientists essentially having to fill in the gaps? Wouldn’t that make every dinosaur in the franchise a hybrid?\n\nEven if you can buy the plot, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Aside from head scratching decisions like having your hybrid, the star attraction at your park, have abilities like camouflage and thus be invisible to the people who paid money to see it, am I not right in saying the Indominous Rex didn’t look too different from any other dinosaur? I mean, what’s so special about this one? It doesn’t look particularly unique, it doesn’t have 50 wings or M16s attached to its face, and if you put it in a room with a T Rex and showed both to someone with little knowledge of Dinosaurs, how would he know which one the hybrid was? The point being, there’s so much hype about this creature being a combination of different creatures, and yet it just looks the same as the rest of them. So why would a kid who apparently is bored of the hundreds of dinosaurs that the Park has engineered be excited about this one. Of course, this could be a meta reference to product distributers often hyping their latest phones, TVs, cars or whatever as a new revolutionary thing when it’s just the same old, same old, or a reference to film goers always complaining that they want something new and unique, when they’ll easily swallow a rehash of things they’ve seen before, like The Force Awakens or Jurassic World itself, providing it’s sold as something new and unique. I wonder if I am probably just giving the movie too much credit here since the Indominous Rex plot was probably just the result of a committee meeting between the producers looking to rake in the dollars as opposed to the film makers making a film where Jurassic Park’s bored attendees are supposed to reflect movie audiences today. The creators of the film have said this is the case but even if it is they made the mistake of basing an entire film around the concept and not have the showy hybrid as a small sub plot as a little reference for self-aware film goers. Yes it seems the movie was taking the piss out of the trope, but it also got sucked into it to the point that it became the very thing it was satirizing. Ironic.\n\nThis hybrid business seems to be one of the ‘it’ trends now in Hollywood for those stale studios who ran out of ideas long ago, along will all-female remakes of classic movies and sequels using the same plots as their predecessors. Jurassic World’s sequel, Fallen Kingdom, had yet another hybrid as its centrepiece only this time it was…smaller. Still, it’s a little more forgiving since the reason for the creation of this creature wasn’t to attract people to a park but bizarrely to be a military weapon. In an age of nuclear bombs and drones I’m not sure what good use an IndoRaptor would be but there you go. But I still think, because of the film’s marketing, the creature was supposed to be one of the main attractions of the film which I thought was a really lame idea since they only did it in the last film and that one was a lot bigger. So where does it end? Will the next movie have one with slightly more colourful skin and market it as the next big thing, or a bigger head, or a couple of more arms? The hybrid plot already felt redundant in Jurassic World and yet here we are three years later with the hybrid stuff not going away.\n\nIs it that the film makers are so devoid of creativity that they can’t make an exciting movie with real dinosaurs, or scared to try something completely new and thus give us something familiar to us only with an added gimmick?\n\nThe JP franchise isn’t the only unable to provide new and memorable villains and instead resort to rehashing previously used concepts only with slight twists. Terminator Salvation had a strange concept in the character played by Sam Worthington being a machine that didn’t know it was a machine, which was mildly interesting even though they didn’t go anywhere with it, then the next movie Genysis completely jumps the shark with the T-3000 John Connor hybrid, which describes itself as neither machine nor human, rather a hybrid nanotechnologica cyborg. Is that supposed to be exciting? If anything, the concept is so far out and unrelatable, as opposed to the original T-800 simple killing machine, that you can’t find the concept remotely stimulating. The T-1000 in Terminator 2 felt fresh, it’s purpose was the same as the last terminator but it’s methods were different and it kept on surprising us – James Cameron really gets this doesn’t he, he also gave us the Queen in Aliens building on the standard Xenomorph - but it’s come to a stage now where you feel they’re just mixing and matching different concepts and complicated terminator names, and if Genisys had a sequel the next terminator would be a transformer. In fact, Salvation already did that!\n\nThat brings us to the new Predator movie. The predator universe is an untapped goldmine. There are so many expansive comics that delve deep into the lore of the universe, but in terms of the movie we’ve had two films where the Predator pops in for a visit, one in a jungle and one in the city, and one where The Predators drop a group of hunters onto a game planet so they can chew their food before they eat it. And that’s it, there’s still so much more to explore. And yet, as showcased by the latest trailer which pits the classic predator against a new sexual tyrannosaurus predator, the movie has gone down the familiar path of scientists faffing about to create a new, bigger, better version of something that is already familiar with us. Where is the creativity – no doubt the soldiers and normal Predators will team up to destroy the abomination, much like how the dinosaurs teamed up in Jurassic World to take out the unnatural Indominous Rex. The Predator isn’t even the film to try out the concept of a new, better predator – Predators introduced a new predator type, and though I’m not really a fan of the film the movie did this very well, telling us that these ones were a different species or clan that was at war with the classic predator. That’s actually impressive world-building, and give us questions to ponder on as to the status of the predators in the universe as the galaxy’s best hunters. But then the film ruins it by having the new predator kill the classic one, pissing off fans and initiating flashbacks to Jurassic Park 3 with the Spinosaurus and the T Rex.\n\nThere is so much that can be done with a new Predator movie, and it boggles the mind why they’ve chosen to go down the hybrid path. You could even just make a standard, Predator lands, takes on skilled killers, dies, roll credits like with the first two movies only set it in a different location and time period. Many predator fans have been excited at the idea of a period Predator movie set in a completely different time period, or the middle east during a time of turmoil and war, or even a Predator movie in Antarctica with a Predator ship crashing in the snow and ice and him having to fight in an environment completely alien to him. The original, classic predtaor can still be interesting, can still be scary, you just need a skilful director to get it right. And that’s not even getting started on having a movie set in space, or a serious go at a decent Alien vs Predator movie. But what have they gone with? The same old hybrid storyline, which was tired even before the trend first gained traction. I think a part of the problem is the guys who make the films try to give us more of the same because audiences always complain that they liked the original movies and don’t want to see characters and mythos bastardized. At the same time you have to provide something new, so they’re in a dilemma. Do they make another Jurassic Park movie with a T Rex as the main threat, or raptors again? Do you just switch up to a different dinosaur like an Allosaurus or Carnotaurus? That would be a downgrade though, like going from a Great White Shark in Jaws to, say, a Bull Shark. So Hollywood tries to put a twist on it, something that appears to be fresh and new – it’s a NEW type of dinosaur, one you’ve never seen before, a hybrid! It’s not even a problems with hybrids themselves – if you take a step back you see this in other franchises also like Star Wars, with Kylo Renn essentially being a hybrid of Darth Vader, Snoke as Palpatine, that Chrome Trooper as Boba Fett, the Starkiller Base a bigger, better Death Star etc etc. This is less of a problem with the hybrid plots themselves and more of an expose of an industry whose tentpole franchises are exhausted of creativity.\n\nYou don’t need a super duper Predator, or flying, chainsaw-wielding dinosaurs, you can make a good movie with a standard villain providing the director has the creative juices and the elements (i.e. money) are all there for a good film to be made. I really hope the new Halloween movie will be good because even though the film is creatively unsound in the sense that it is not reinventing the wheel, but its success will drive the point home that you don’t need the villain to be a relative of the protagonist in a surprise twist, have him part of some supernatural cult or any weirdness like that. If your cast is on point and you have a decent premise, letting a competent director do his thing might be the key as opposed to hybrids and mutant versions of classic baddies. But in an age where it seems anyone and everyone with a bit of cash can make a film, finding a quality directors with good ideas that he can implement might be harder than engineering a Dinosaur hybrid in a laboratory.",

        "text": "It seems there are three types of \"updating\" in films adapted from written works: Those which are updated in order to even be functionally intelligible to general audiences; those which are updated due to a plethora of existing adaptations (a category that often overlaps with the previous), and those which are updated primarily to reflect current audience demographics. \n\nWorks based on Shakespeare are strong examples of the first two categories, and there's not much basis for objecting to an updated setting there: The source material is challenging as raw entertainment, and adaptations based on it are ubiquitous, so any given version merely increases the scope of opportunities for people to understand what they're seeing.  But the third raises very clear artistic objections.\n\nFor instance, if source material is fully intelligible to modern audiences, but the pop culture cues and nostalgia shibboleths would not resonate, does updating anyway mean commercial directives are being pursued at the expense of narrative richness?  \n\nThe Stephen King horror novel \"It\" takes place for much of its story in the 1950s and is steeped in the pop culture of that decade, but the recent film adaptation updates this to the 1980s to reflect the childhoods of current adult audiences.  Is this a legitimate \"translation\" of audience perspectives on childhood, or is it corrupt, manipulative pandering that erases a wealth of cultural insights and atmosphere from the source material?\n\nMore broadly, when is updating a service to communication, and when is it commercially-driven \"dumbing down\" that assumes audiences will be alienated by any context they're not already intimately familiar with?",

        "text": "Legendary film scholar and theorical father of the French New Wave young filmmakers André Bazin once described the western genre as the “american cinema par excellence”, and there is little room to deny that. The whole concept of a more simpler time, governed by a rule of law that still oscillated between wild nature and civilized society, the men who inhabited these spaces and how they related to one another, it was all captured since the beginning of american cinema. However, the genre has evolved in multiple forms, and many countries other than the United States have turned their attention to tales of the old west. Still, somehow those stories remained related to a more or lesser degree with the whole american mythology surrounding the western. And then we have last year’s “Western”: directed by german Valeska Grisebach, its set in 21st century Bulgaria and follows a group of german construction workers. But why would a film with such a premise have a title reminiscent of the legendary tales of gunslingers of old?\n\nA group of german workers go to Bulgaria for a job of building a hydroelectric station, all with the intention of “making some money”. Yet, more than a few irregularities surrounding the deal take a toll on the construction process, and soon the workers find themselves with not much to do there besides drinking beer and advancing on the local women. The culture is really different to what they expected and the idiomatic barrier makes it hard for them to communicate. One of them, Meinhard (Meinhard Neumann), the most solitary of the lot, slowly starts getting closer to the local population and learning their customs. The others, however, don’t exactly see the situation as he does, and their old notions and prejudices quickly come into conflict with the new world in which they find themselves.\n\nhttps://breakingthefourthwallsite.wordpress.com/2018/07/10/western-relocating-the-frontier-mythos/",

        "text": "I've had a little bit written down about this film but I never thought much about expanding my thoughts on it until via dumb luck I stumbled upon a writeup discussing Gregg Araki's films on i-d. I got motivated to talk a little bit about Araki as a director and one of my favorite films from him, and one that has impacted me a lot as a creative.\n\nA bit of a disclaimer: I'm not a film major. I’ve never written really about film in a formal critical sense (the closest I’ve come is writing about Videodrome in a Media Theory class freshman year; my paper got a C) and I don’t think I’m anywhere close to being a ‘cultured’ film buff or even much of one at all -- sometimes it’s a chore to go through my watchlist, and even though I lived across the street from a movie theatre in college last year I spent most of my time cooped up in my dorm watching music videos. I have the attention span of a concussed goldfish, and I think that’s actually an important thing to consider: I am the type of viewer that is a normal director’s worst enemy – yet Gregg Araki’s films command my full, undivided attention. \n\n**Nowhere (1997)** is probably one of the first films in a long time I went out of my way to rewatch on my own time. \nI suspect a lot of people’s experience with Gregg Araki starts with **Mysterious Skin (2004)**, probably his best-received and “conventional” film that respectfully and expertly handles a tough subject matter and makes the best of Joseph Gordon Levitt’s performance. Mine, though, was Nowhere, the final film in his Teenage Apocalypse trilogy – an incredibly jarring fever dream that seems like equal parts a love letter to MTV and 90s alt culture (at least insofar as I’ve gleaned as a 21 year old “kinda vaguely remember 9/11 but not really” millennial) as it is independent filmmaking. \n\nThe editing in this film is non-existent. I took an editing course for my major last semester and I think if I made anything close to this film I would have been expelled from the entire media production program on the spot. Jump cuts happen (often within the same action or even the same *line*) for no reason. The dialogue is [nonsense-slang even by 90s standards](https://youtu.be/zlJDFB53p60?t=79). There’s hardly even a real plot to speak of – just vignettes leading up to the climatic party and Dark (James Duval in peak “pretending to be Keanu Reeves” form) trying to come to terms with the fact that [he isn’t built for the hedonistic life he and his friends are deep in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg7fT92F-98). \n\nYet, the film is intoxicatingly addicting – it refuses to make concessions for the world it’s created for itself (one where characters are named Dark, Zero, Lucifer, Egg et al, an alien abducts people in broad daylight and Baywatch’s Jaason Simmons essentially plays himself). Instead, it dares you to keep up with its pace and lose yourself in its [dreamlike quality and ethereal vibe](https://imgur.com/a/10hPPeA) - the set design and mood in this film is something else. The [i-d article]( https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/j5nek7/the-radical-queer-masculinity-in-gregg-arakis-dark-coming-of-age-films-now-apocalypse) I mentioned here discusses Araki’s subversive, surreal, almost-oneiric depictions of LGBT life – if Call Me By Your Name is classical, Nowhere and the rest of the TA trilogy are No Wave/Punk as fuck, rooted closer in antagonistic-but-celebratory works like Kenneth Anger’s filmography. After seemingly a corpus of queer films where the main characters die or resign themselves to loneliness or living a lie or whatever, there’s something refreshing and cool about Araki playing fast and loose with the idea of what indie films and queer cinema can be.\n\nNowhere is slice of life filtered through the coke-addled lens of every Gen X stereotype, a microcosm of the mid 90s. Everything is happening, [you’ve got an underlying sense of dread – but you don’t know why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jl1Ollyisw). Despite what I’ve written about the film’s technical insanity, I think it’s the film that probably encompasses the “Teenage Apocalypse” trilogy, and it’s my favorite out of all of Araki’s work, even over his more critically acclaimed work like Mysterious Skin. It’s so MTV it hurts, and I don’t think that’s that big of a surprise considering that Araki would [later direct a pilot for the network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTvVcXFjlog) that didn’t get greenlit but looked (and felt) incredibly similar. Two decades later, Araki looks as though he’ll finally be able to pick up that fever dream vibe again with [Now Apocalypse]( https://deadline.com/2018/03/starz-greenlights-now-apocalypse-comedy-series-kaboom-gregg-araki-steven-soderbergh-1202353597/), but that’s for a different discussion. \n\n\n",

I liked the quiet, but minimalist (to reference a review from Rate Your Music) and subtle vibe that it had. I really liked its atmosphere as well, and I thought that Jef Costello was an awesome protagonist. \n\nHowever, one thing that I would like to discuss about \"Le Samourai\", is how it stands up and/or compares to modern cinema. I hate to bring up a stereotype like this, but I will admit that some modern films (i.e. basically everything from the MCU, \"Terminator: Genisys\", \"Justice League\", etc.) can be flashy, wild spectacles that don't have a lot of subtlety or experimentation. I think that all of us have seen bombastic, over the top blockbusters that don't allow things to settle down a little bit. \n\nHowever, \"Le Samourai\" stands out, for how quiet &amp; subtle it is. There are long stretches without dialogue, and music isn't a huge part of the film. \"Le samourai\" isn't a flashy or explosive film, and its action scenes/violent parts are done with grace &amp; elegance. \"Le Samourai\" is engrossing with its atmosphere and quiet nature, and I feel that its minimalism makes it stand out, for its genre. \n\nSo, how would you guys say that \"Le Samourai\" compares to modern cinema? Has its style increased in relevance, over time?",

But at the same time, it's *probably* not a movie you'd put on your list of top 10 movies of all time. Critically speaking, it seems like the highest rated movies have to be dramas that take themselves seriously. They're movies that fit very particular criteria. And it makes you wonder why that has to be the case. So for example, I'll point out films like The Mummy (1999) and Pirates of the Caribbean. Many people enjoy these films. They're lighthearted with many fun and memorable moments, but again, no one will put them among the ranks of something like The Godfather, even though the former films are \"easier\" to watch. \n\nSo to summarise, there are films that I think are very well made on a technical level. But it wouldn't be the same kind of film that I'd choose to watch over and over again if I was stuck on an island for twenty years. Does anyone else share that kind of perspective? \n\n ",

I already know the Rabbits are talking about time of death and they're in purgatory or whatever ('cause I saw someone unscramble the Rabbits short film dialogue years ago).\n\nI did read the explanations about the film, how it's meant to be something like deities trying to defeat the Phantom who had the girl kill her husband and herself or whatever it was. But also that it's essentially a bunch of random clips Lynch shot day by day and camera test type stuff he didn't want to see go to waste.\n\nI don't see how people can say it's \"nonsensical like Mulholland Drive\". Mulholland Drive has a very clear plot and it's all pretty obvious in meaning. I don't even think it's meant to be confusing we're literally shown everything first hand at the end of the film and the intentions are very clear.\n\nI would definitely say Mulholland Drive is David Lynch's masterpiece movie, not Inland Empire. Inland Empire is more like an art gallery type of thing than a movie. Just wanted to post since I sat through 3 hours of the film and there are two good scenes (and the Rabbits are alright but I seen lots of Rabbits stuff years ago, the shorts version of it). Well okay maybe 4 good scenes. The two I mention though are the obvious: Running, and face. You know what I mean. And then the police interrogation and dying in the streets.  \n\n\nSoccer moms dancing to \"do the locomotion\" and stuff though lol.",

I really enjoy the look of 4:3, in modern and classic cinema, and I want to know what 4:3 accomplishes in an emotional sense. To me, 4:3 feels very intimate, because of how close the characters have to be to each other, and it feels nostalgic to me because 4:3 is often associated with the past. What's the reason people use it today, though? What stories work best with a 4:3 aspect ratio?",

So I ask, did you enjoy this movie and it's leanings towards authenticity or did you feel like we and the actors were finessed into this experiment Harmony Korine put on for us.\n\nWhat ends up making something exploitive ends up being, I believe, more about the intention. You can be using a non-actor to push some ham-fisted narrative that they have no connection to but you can also just let them be them. Gummo I believe accomplishes the latter. This film is about putting people on camera and letting them be expressive but with the freedom of calling this movie a loose-narrative work. Is this all still to Harmony Korine's benefit, yes, but I still think it gets to something truthful on screen.\n\nVideo Form: https://goo.gl/UnV6tV\n\nedit: for spelling :/\n",

        "text": "Video Form: [https://youtu.be/9mtQIQ4ZTgo](https://youtu.be/9mtQIQ4ZTgo)\n\n**The Thin Red Line: A War in the Heart of Nature**\n\nThe Thin Red Line is an experience. It’s a fascinating look at war that only a visionary director like Terrence Malick could have achieved. Much more than a conventional war film, it’s a dreamy meditation between the real and the metaphysical, between being and transcending. Unlike for example Spielberg’s graphic portrayal of war in Saving Private Ryan, which came out a few months before Malick’s film, The Thin Red Line offers no clearly defined emotional solutions, it isn’t based on pro-American principles and overall wasn’t marketable entertainment to general audiences (except for the massive cast). Because of this The Thin Red Line is better approached as art and as a philosophy lesson than a traditional war film. It’s a film that focuses on questions that are perhaps impossible to answer and seeks to examine the very purpose of all war and man’s role in nature. \n\nThe movie opens with a crocodile, a killing machine which is a representation of savage nature, slithering into hiding. This signals the violence and danger that already dwell in nature regardless whether humans interfere with it or not, but the crocodile also comes into play later. The central question of the movie is presented in the opening: Why does nature contend with itself? The opening minutes of the film follow two soldiers gone AWOL, living in peace with tribal people. Malick implies this is the kind of society that reflects man’s best nature. As this theme connects man within nature, Malick rarely mentions the actual battle of Guadalcanal that the movie depicts, nor the goals of the characters as a group, nor the United States in this setting. The basis of the film is found in the existential questions characters ask through the form of voice overs and dialogue, not in historical details of the war.\n\nFar away from home, these men create their own meaning to try to make sense of the horror surrounding them since they are forced to consider life as they contemplate their own mortality. The philosophical debate at the core of the film is reflected in the opposing ideologies of Private Witt, one of the soldiers gone AWOL and Sergeant Welsh, played by Sean Penn. Witt is an optimist and his time with the natives suggest that he learns a truth that is too profound for Welsh to grasp: That humankind and nature can coexist in harmony. That we are as much a part of nature as grass, water, animals and trees. On the other hand Welsh’s views are as pragmatic as they are cynical, believing mankind is simply moved by forces outside of our control, like economic and political power. Malick continuously exchanges these two points of view in the film, as the battle scenes that are filled with death and suffering sometimes give way to peaceful images of nature, light shining through leaves and lingering images of animals. This stark contrast between the real and the ideal is at the heart of the film. Welsh says “In this world, a man himself is nothing… and there ain’t no world but this one.” Witt replies “You’re wrong there. I seen another world.” And Welsh finishes the thought: “Well, you’re seeing something I never will.” Witt has asked himself so many questions about existence and he’s seen the other side, that he can see beyond the limitations Welsh puts in front of him. Beyond the limitations of military structure and political power, into a world of ultimate transcendence and balance among nature.\n\nDuring the attack on the last Japanese stronghold on the island, the American operation is a success. However, instead of making the scene feel climactic, Malick transmits a sense of defeat for both parties. The war is seen as nothing more than a series of continued atrocities. In the middle of the mayhem, a buried face of a dead Japanese soldier speaks to Witt in a voiceover: “Are you righteous? Loved by all? Know that I was too.” Through Witt’s eyes, the viewer now recognizes that war brings suffering to both sides and remains a tragedy regardless of borders.\n\nThe film’s central message of war as a crime against nature is explored several times in the film. The crocodile that’s seen in the opening shot is later seen again, but this time as a captive of soldiers. When man proves himself to be the most dangerous predator of all, it’s clear that war is a crime against nature more than against humanity itself. Amid the gunfire and explosions during the battle for Hill 210, the focus suddenly shifts to a dying bird, its wing shattered by gunfire. Malick wanted to get the point across that all living beings have the uncontrollable need of killing one another. \n\nThe Thin Red Line is historically ambiguous and it asks too many questions about reality to possibly answer. But this makes the film a kind of mystical experience, dwelling on the transcendence of the spiritual and the evils of war. The answers to the questions asked by Mallick are not important. What’s important is that we ask these questions at all. Malick’s view of the world where Nature exists in balance with mankind is hopeful, but we might never see it. There’s an old midwestern saying “There’s only a thin red line between the sane and the mad.” The line remains.\n\nVideo Form: [https://youtu.be/9mtQIQ4ZTgo](https://youtu.be/9mtQIQ4ZTgo)",

I'm a big admirer of Hayao Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli, and after watching their 21 films (some of them for the first time) plus Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, The Castle of Cagliostro, Studio Ponoc's Mary and the Witch's Flower, (well I still got to see The Red Turtle) this year, I decided to put my free time in preparing (I hope this year) different videos about their art and film universe.          \nOriginally I wanted to make this video as a collection of similar shots between two elements. Then I evolve to the element of fire and water (thanks in part to a video from Kogonada) and its similarities and differences. And as I was editing, I realized that the video was a bit more than a supercut but much less than a video essay. It has the potential to be deeper.          \nI refer to this because nature and its elements in Miyazaki's films take on a bigger role than just being the place where the story unfolds, or simply something attractive to show in one shot. The elements are responsible for moving the plot or produce it (or even are characters), the elements are those that can be a help or a problem for the characters.          \nAnd Miyazaki has been consistent in his 11 films about this (and about flying, but that's another point). I did not see a significant change between the films regarding the use of the elements. Each film has to a greater or lesser extent the use of them.        \nWe could also take into consideration the repetition of images in the movies of Miyazaki. Maybe its repetition is part of facilitating the animation, but I prefer to see it as moments repeated throughout the same universe. Life imitating life and so.          \nWhat other directors besides Malick, do you think has a style in which the elements of nature are predominant and what role does it have in the film?           \nOr what other things can you discover or point out in Miyazaki's filmography and cinematography?         \nPS: Pardon my English and I hope you enjoy the video.

The story is told through the portrait of three women, two in particular, their relationship spiraling into questions of identity and individuality.\n\nMildred “Pinky” Rose (Sissy Spacek) is a new hire at the elderly health spa and takes a shining to her trainer, Millie (Shelley Duvall). Soon enough, they end up moving in together, sharing time at the nearby tavern run by Willie (Janice Rule) and her husband Edgar (Robert Fortier). As a setup, this all sounds quite tame, of course. But it is about the execution where the film takes its lead and runs with it.\n\nPinky’s actions throughout the first half, and in effect Spacek’s performance, are those of awe and adulation. Her childish antics are well-defined in blowing bubbles into her drink at the cafe, intently watching the older people in the room and playing around with a wheelchair when no one is looking. But it is in her infatuation and fascination with Millie that the film really takes a turn. The suddenness of the character shift that occurs later on is something that Spacek handles with ease, becoming something else entirely and making that shift believable. It’s an impressive feat, one made up of both emotional and physical transformation and showcasing Spacek’s talent in spectacular fashion.\n\nDuvall’s Millie is almost like a ghost, seen but rarely heard, speaking of the trends she’s into or interested in or of the many dates she goes on, but it goes through one ear and out the other. Those in her vicinity do not even pander to her, simply ignoring her the best they can. Despite that, she continues, spinning tales in the hopes one day they will show more attention. Her dates are never seen, their existence left in question. When she goes to the hospital cafeteria across from work and talks to the men, they never in any form respond to her.\n\nRule as Willie is mostly silent throughout the run of the movie, a mainstay presence but somewhat in the background as she runs the Dodge City tavern with her husband Edgar (they also happen to own the apartment building that Millie and Pinky share). She is focused on her painting, creating murals of great creations, exaggerated women clutching at each other who look more creature than human and a lone man who stands before them (three women and a man… allusion!).\n\nThe influence of Ingmar Bergman’s *Persona* can be felt considerably throughout the film, mainly in the form of identity. What belongs to one person, and what belongs to two when the most intimate or personal are shared? Lines blur, and where one begins and the other ends becomes a fascinating lens through which the drama unfolds.\n\nThis theme of malleability in the film, accompanied by many shots of water and the shapes that are beyond it, lends to the question of whether we are really what we are, but what we intend to be. There are moments captured through the fish tank, showing Millie and Pinky through that barrier, as though they are shifting and changing before our very eyes. The malleable nature is transposed over the proceedings in the second half of the movie, after the cataclysmic event that changes the trajectories of its two leads. At first it comes in the form of Pinky punching a second hole in Millie’s punch card. Then it’s her social security number being used, and her diary being written in. There’s a point of not quite identity theft, but identity insurrection, where Pinky’s real name, Mildred, and Millie’s full name, Mildred, are one and the same. They are intertwined by name, location, and vocation, and in the film’s climax, as things begin to shift again, they even share the same bed.\n\nThe film shows its hand with a car ride near the middle of the film, where Pinky talks about the twins at work. She wonders aloud if they sometimes change places, and whether anyone would ever notice. It is a good moment of showing both characters’ views on the matter before the events click into place. One takes the side of it being fun, while the other does not see it as practical. Of course they would know which one is which, Millie says without giving it too much thought. If only she knew what she was in for.\n\nThere is a dream-like quality to the filmmaking itself, an air of floatiness to the way the camera captures the story and performances. The camera trails about as though it is not always going to capture the attention of the scene, the thing playing out that is integral to the moment, but rather something else equally as noteworthy to witness. The desert that most of the film takes place in is barren and unforgiving in its presentation, suggesting only the characters and the buildings exist and nothing else.\n\nThere is a gorgeously layered dream sequence in the third act woven into itself, a constant fading foreground and background shifting and giving way to meaning after meaning. It shows that everything has a purpose, nothing happens by accident, and that it weighs heavily on Pinky’s mind as the demons of her actions play out in her mind.\n\nThe film’s final scene is yet another shift, and how one character refers to another adds to the idea that the shifting will possibly continue, or has reverted. But still the paintings remain the same, perhaps the only thing that will always remain the same.\n\nAltman has created a number of classics over his career, this being among them. *3 Women* is a wonderfully made movie that uses its cast remarkably well, focusing on the details and touching on ideas not many other films have tackled with such creativity and uniqueness. It demands your time, and patience, and it will reward you.\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/07/3-women/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/07/3-women/) for pics and review score",

It is filled with so much dread, ambiguity, and bleakness.\n\nThe opening scene pre title card was easily the most fascinating and brutal setup to a movie I have ever witnessed. I love how the viewer is instantly shocked within a minute of the opening.\n\nI'm a sucker for really depressing films (the road and the revenant are some of my favorites), but I think this takes the cake for depressing films.\n\nThe cinematography and long takes make the movie seem so grounded and realistic. I loved how muted the color palette is, attempting to mimic realism.\n\nI also loved how grounded in reality Director Cuarón placed the film's setting in. Where so many post apocalyptic settings are rooted in future or near future, Children of Men's scenario is eerily the most realistic depiction of a dystopian future that we will probably ever see on film.\n\nOverall, it's probably the most unnerving movie I have ever seen, and I've seen some pretty messed up films (Eraserhead or Cannibal Holocaust don't even come close).\n\nJust to note: did anyone else get a serious District 9 vibe from this movie? Notably the cinematography and the surreal environmental storytelling.",

I’m not one to say that he doesn’t put quality or effort into his recent work, but it seems that nowadays his films are only edgy and stylized because, well, that’s what Burton’s best known for. For example, his films Alice In Wonderland, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, and Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children seem very tired and uninspired and sort of feel a bit misguided. Burton definitely has his masterpieces, but I feel as if he’s diving into flop territory. I’m not trying to put anyone who likes his work down, but I’d like to know. Anyone else feel the same? ",

A film I didn't really enjoy but finished because I always try to give movies a fair shake but also because I'd have to review it for a youtube channel.\n\nMinor Spoilers for *Hot Summer Nights* ahead!\n\nThe movie starts to feel like a *Goodfellas* ape pretty early on, particularly when the main character has his \"getting in the drug business\" montage.\n\nI tried to dampen my immediate feeling of distaste towards what felt like a pale and blatant imitation of Martin Scorsese (VO and all.) I wanted to be able to give the movie an opportunity to show me that it's reaching from something different but I'm not 100% sure I found that in the end. \n\nFor reference here is the *Goodfellas* scene that came to mind.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6846CQWZbVg\n\nHere's is something comparable from *Wolf of Wall Street*.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UTSqg4sqlU\n\nLast year when I, Tonya came out people where making similar assertions but in the end that film was sleek and smart enough for me to really have fun with. \nStill I'd say that movie and how it carries out exposition feels very much like Scorsese. \n\nThis comparison doesn't happen with every movie using stylish direction and VO. When I watch *Fight Club* or *Train Spotting* I don't find myself making the same sort of claims.\n\nTLDR / to summarize:\nI was hoping someone here could help me decipher what sort of elements add up to make a directors work distinct from other directors that have used similar technique and style.\n\nP.S. - I thought the movie was beautiful overall but still fell kind of fell flat for me; mostly because narrative shortcomings.\n",

I feel like I'm missing out on what I could have loved about the film. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter watching, I felt similar to when I watched Lady Bird, except I enjoyed Lady Bird much more. I think because neither film really had a thematic direction or big \"lesson to be learned,\" but I empathized more with Lady Bird than Elio. \n\nThere were a few scenes I really liked. One of which was when Elio \"confesses\" to Oliver while walking around the monument. This was maybe my favorite scene of the film, but I felt a little disconnected at the start. It felt a little out of the blue to me; the fact that they had this mutual understanding of each other's desires. Maybe it's because I missed a few of the hints when I was watching (and later realized) so I wasn't on the same page with the characters. I guess if I rewatched the film I'd get a better feel. I feel like this kind of thing was what made the film not \"love,\" but \"like\" for me. \n\nAnyways, I enjoyed watching it and would like to hear if anyone else can relate and why/how.  \nI've never been taught anything about cinema; I'd like to, but as an engineering student I can't spare the time. So I'm just trying to learn from experience and online critique. Thanks!",

The transition from the hauntingly depressing tale of Cop 223 into the almost fairy tale-esque, ultimately cozy story of Faye and Cop 663 is an extremely polarizing change that almost shocked me when I first watched it.\n\nFor the first half of the film the audience is presented with the story of a young man that just can't seem to get over his recent breakup, resorting to jogging and cans of pineapple as escapism from his sadness. Cop 223 seems so young and inexperienced in life and he is clearly in over his head when he meets the woman in the blonde wig. This is offset by the calm, experienced attitude of Cop 663 and his eventually falling for Faye. 663 is facing a similar situation, dealing with the aftermath of hooking up with a flight stewardess who never returned to him. However, the way that his story ends up is almost completely opposite of how Cop 223's does. After Faye cutely but creepily begins invading 663's apartment, he slowly falls for her and although he initially misses out on going to California with Faye, she returns to find him still at the restaurant she worked at, holding the waterlogged boarding pass from a year prior.\n\nOther than the whimsical plot, the clear takeaways from this film are the soundtrack and the cinematography/direction from Kar-Wai. Nearly 9 minutes of this movie are scored by the song California Dreamin', obviously a nod to Faye's desire to move to California one day. Normally hearing something over and over again would prove to be cumbersome and eventually boring, but there's something so endearing seeing Faye blast her CD of the song over and over again while nodding her head enthusiastically. The other outstanding song for me on this OST is Faye's cover of Dreams by The Cranberries. The montage of her crazily fixing up 663's apartment while this song played instantly became one of my favorite and most memorable scenes in all of cinema.\n\nIn terms of the cinematography and direciton, Chungking Express is simply masterclass. The twirling camerawork and constant shots that begin their focus on a mirror and slowly reveal we're looking at a reflection are genius and clearly a major influence for many films for years to come. The chaotic handheld quality during the normal, everyday life sequences gives the audience the crowded, stressful feeling of life in Hong Kong. The film is filled with shots that put the protagonist into a small corner or window of the frame, giving the illusion that they are simply a small part of the bigger picture of life. The cinematography makes you feel claustrophobic, yet comfortable and portrays life in an almost \"fly-on-the-wall\" mannerism that really makes you feel like you're just observing these people live and fall in love.\n\nTo put it simply, I just haven't been able to stop thinking about this film since I saw it a few days ago and I just had to write a little bit about it. I've been going back and looking at my favorite scenes and it's pretty much cemented itself as one of my new favorites and a definite all-time great. I'm looking forward to exploring the rest of Kar-wai's filmography if it means seeing anything else like Chungking Express.\n\n",

        "text": "I've been making a list that includes oldies I want to see, and I would like to see any films that are of course considered influential as I understand D.W. Griffith's works like The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance are, but I'm also interested, perhaps moreso, in anything that was just considered very good films at the time, what can still stand today as \\*excellent work\\*. I'm not worried about not being entertained (I loved and have loved this medium from afar-ish all my life) I'm only worried about wasting my time on movies that nobody cared about terribly much in the first place.\n\nSo I'm most interested in sci-fi, horror, anything psychological that invokes concepts concerned with subjective psychological experience, war films, historical works, and surprisingly I've discovered for the silent era... comedy! I cannot get enough of Buster Keaton films and I want to watch all of them and of course get at Charlie Chaplin soon.\n\nFor sci-fi I already watched Metropolis, look forward to M (I know it's not sci-fi, but speaking for Fritz Lang); for horror I watched The Student From Prague last night (so creepy), and Dr. Caligari, Nosferatu are on my list, actually German Expressionism is something I want to explore thoroughly (also any other movements, directors, films like this -- it's exactly my top interest in film, portraying subjective experience).\n\nAlso for anyone not aware, here's this great channel called [silentfilmhouse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ZyvXxO0tvyct3ixFUbdiA) which has a nice collection of early films, including what looks like complete collections of Georges Melies and Segundo de Chomon films -- what I'm digging through right now (I actually watched Hugo the other day -- that was cool).\n\nSo what else is there? I'm going through all the wikipedia, Roger Ebert's, IMDB best ever lists, also looking to understand and appreciate, not just consume, but I don't want to miss anything really good before I get into what seems like the easier-to-navigate territory of post-20s film.

        "text": "*The Graduate* has always been a perennial favorite of mine, and a true masterpiece from director Mike Nichols. An incredible follow-up to his debut *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*, *The Graduate* really shows his improvement as a director. You can see a distinct difference in the contained, play-like way in which *Woolf* is shot versus the varied use of cinematic language implemented in *The Graduate*, namely the use of symbolism. The film is rife with symbolism that is prominent throughout the whole film, without ever bashing you over the head with it. Most obviously is Mrs. Robinson being surrounded by jungle imagery to accentuate her predatory nature. Water is everywhere in the film as well, symbolizing Ben's sensation of drowning as he struggles to find his direction in life. In the beginning he's framed by the fish tank in his room to make him look like he's underwater, and the entire scene at the pool for his birthday where is parents physically force him to the bottom really emphasizes that parallel. There is one form of symbolism that's recurrent though that I've never seen anyone mention, and it's how Ben rejects adulthood symbolically by refusing drinking and smoking.\n\nI actually wrote an entire breakdown on the symbolism of *The Graduate*, but it's too long to post here. To anyone who is interested, I'd love to invite them to [check it out](https://medium.com/@DavidA.Punch/the-graduate-symbolism-in-film-a549ef9882c0).",

I saw  several of them in dirty prints full of hisses and pops on the soundtrack and they were overwhelming experiences. Rewatching them in cleaned up versions on DVD they haven't had quite the same impact. I particularly noticed a difference in the still shots often used between scenes; in a clean print they are essentially still photos - nothing changes over the length of the shot. In an old print the shots had a sort of hypnotic energy caused by all the dust and scrapes and crackling sound that held me captivated.\n\nDo you have any examples of your own?",

        "text": "I first watched this film at a film festival, sandwiched in with other foreign films like Cabaret Balkan and Mexican indie or experimental films. I really fell in love with Luna Papa though, it was unflinchingly bleak but presented what amounts to a tragedy with nearly endless charisma and humor, making it not only bearable, it was enchanting.\n\nMamlakat is a 17 year old aspiring actress who comes from a tight knit family... her brother suffers from mental damage from his time as a soldier and requires a lot of care. Her father is a strong and overprotective patriarch and widower. One night she goes see a presentation of a Shakespeare play (I do not remember which but I bet it is relevant). That night she meets somebody in the shadows  who claims to be an actor and they end up having sex. The scene is quite fantastical and it sets the tone for the movie... they basically fall down a hill and slide down together, with him groping and grabbing her. This could be read at face value as a very strange meet cute, or it can be seen as her interpretation of what was almost assuredly sexual assault.\n\nAnd it might not even be her interpretation, you see this film is narrated by her unborn child meaning everything is seen through a somewhat whimsical and childlike lens. Her becoming pregnant, her misadventures trying to get an abortion, the way she is scorned by a very conservative village, and her fathers quest to find the man who got her pregnant and force him to marry her. All of it has little bits of slapstick and adventure, despite being really tough subject matter.\n\nWhat makes this story work is just how farcical, fantastical and action packed it is along the way. Back in 1999 this movie went through some criticism of being too 'Hollywood' in that it injected too much entertainment into what many expected to be a difficult watch. But it is this mix of magic and realism that makes the movie work, the fact that it has many events that do not make any literal sense, but they make perfect sense in a more imaginative, playful way.\n\nIn the end this movie is a tragedy, but it is an extremely funny and sweet one. Hopefully you guys can find it streaming somewhere, I did see it is on youtube with subtitles in Spanish if you are Hispanic like me. Also Amazon has DVD's if you do not mind taking a little risk for a really fascinating film.",

        "title": "House-A thoroughly unique experience over forty years later",
        "author": "Carlislegendary",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8wjc38/housea_thoroughly_unique_experience_over_forty/",
        "text": " [https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/05/film-frame-friday-house/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/05/film-frame-friday-house/) link for all the crazy pictures and gifs. \n\n  I’ll be covering one of my favorite Criterion releases, the wonderfully wacky, what-the-hell-did-I-just-watch classic, *House*. Criterion themselves provided the description of the film that has stuck with me the most: “An episode of *Scooby-Doo* as directed by Mario Bava.” It’s easy to dismiss the film as a psychedelic novelty, a drug-fueled relic of the 1970s with no real value beyond its wild visuals, but there’s a powerful strain of melancholy running through the film, and—if anything—that melancholy manages to gain power from the film’s strange and unique style. \n\nÔbayashi throws every camera trick in the book at this film, and somehow it comes out strong and cohesive, rather than the mess one might expect. The film achieves a heightened sense of emotion through its constant barrage of jarring editing and effects.\n\nÔbayashi directed a short film nearly a decade prior to *House* called *Emotion* that draws influence from various preceding experimental filmmakers such as Man Ray, Teinosuke Kinugasa, Jean Epstein, Luis Buñuel and Maya Deren. While *House* takes a wildly different direction, the experimental editing techniques Ôbayashi employed in *Emotion* clearly informed those in *House*. Visually, the film ranges from hazy, nostalgic scenes to frantic action sequences. Ôbayashi uses all sorts of techniques—animation, stop motion, matte effects, blue screen effects, collage, vignettes, slow motion, multiple exposure, iris shots and countless others—to create the unique experience of *House*.\n\nDuring calm, serene scenes, Ôbayashi makes use of soft focus and colorful skies in the background. One of the most peaceful scenes in the movie takes place near the beginning at Gorgeous’s residence, when her father introduces her to his partner Ryoko. The camera looks through a glass door onto an idyllic balcony with lots of plants and a beautiful painted sunset in the background. Ryoko enters in slow motion, her white outfit and scarf billowing in the wind (which only seems to affect her) against the sunset behind her. As the characters move to and fro, the camera slowly tracks to follow them, the angles in the glass door fragmenting the image. The scene is very reminiscent of early Technicolor films; in fact, this is the case almost anytime Ryoko is on screen. There is also an interesting effect in this scene when Gorgeous throws Ryoko’s scarf and runs off; the frame is split vertically, with the right side frozen with Gorgeous in it and the left side showing the scarf floating through the air in slow motion.\n\nAnother interesting effect is the use of a silent film aesthetic. While the girls are on the train on the way to the titular house, Gorgeous tells the other girls about her aunt’s past. This takes the form of a flashback shot like a silent film, complete with grainy black and white visuals, undercranking and intertitles, punctuated only twice by color for emphasis: once with the fiancé’s draft card, and once with the rose the aunt is holding, which drips bright red animated blood. While this scene plays out, the girls comment on it as if they are actually watching the silent film. A camera flash cuts to footage of a mushroom cloud, and one of the girls exclaims, “It’s like a cotton candy!” They also comment on the film burning up as the aunt and her fiancé kiss, which is yet another interesting effect.\n\nÔbayashi doesn’t try to hide the artificiality of the sets. There is even a direct wink to the audience regarding this when the girls get off the bus in Gorgeous’s aunt’s village; there is a billboard with a landscape painted on it, with the “real” backdrop behind it. In wide shots, the viewer can see it’s a billboard the girls are standing in front of, but in medium shots the billboard is more or less indistinguishable from the “actual” background. The film cares so little about presenting realistic visuals that it ultimately doesn’t even matter which is the true backdrop.\n\nThe pace of the editing picks up as the girls reach the house and the horror begins. There is a scene in which Sweet watches Prof while alternatingly closing each eye. We are then shown her perspective, with two adjacent cameras each showing a slightly different view of Prof and representing the view from each of Sweet’s eyes. There is a dolly zoom as Fantasy pulls the “watermelon” out of the well. There is also an additional Hitchcock homage later on, when Sweet is attacked by mattresses from below through a glass floor. There is a fight scene between Kung Fu and the possessed Gorgeous that is straight out of a wuxia film, with both of them soaring through the air and defying gravity. When the remaining girls find Gorgeous after her aunt has possessed her, the scene plays at a much lower framerate, illustrating the aunt’s disorientation in her new body. At other times, the film alternates shots literally every other frame when something extremely intense is happening. These sorts of techniques occur constantly throughout the movie, demanding the viewer’s attention at all times.\n\nOne of the film’s most iconic scenes is the one in which Melody is eaten by a piano. This scene makes wonderful use of blue screen effects and superimposed animation in its depiction of the piano eating Melody’s fingers, then her hand, and then the rest of her. We see arms and legs flailing out of the piano as it thrashes about, and various body parts in a pool of blood inside the piano. Finally, we see her severed fingers floating from one piano key to another before the fallboard crushes them in a spray of blood. That this happens because Melody played the lullaby-like song that has been a source of peace throughout the film makes it even more gruesome.\n\nI want to discuss the mirror “possession” sequence in detail, as it’s probably the most memorable moment in the film. Its editing and brilliant imagery burn themselves into the viewer’s mind. Gorgeous is sitting at her aunt’s vanity putting on lipstick. In the mirror she sees her reflection smiling back. Her reflection then turns into her aunt, dressed like Gorgeous. Gorgeous turns around to see if her aunt is in the room, and when she turns back it is her own reflection again. Then her reflection smiles to reveal fangs resembling those of a Japanese demon. The reflection then fades back to her aunt. A terrified expression comes over the aunt’s face. We cut briefly to Shiro the cat, whose eyes flash green, then back to the mirror, which begins to crack. The reflection cries blood, and blood runs down the cracked mirror as well. We cut to Gorgeous staring at the mirror as pieces crack and fall off of her face, as if she herself were a mirror, revealing a raging fire beneath. Then we see her completely engulfed in fire, or rather, she has *become* fire. She slowly raises her hand to her lips as if continuing to put on lipstick, and the scene ends. From the moment Gorgeous’s reflection smiles at her to the end of the scene only lasts about a minute, but it’s packed with incredible images.\n\n*House* was released in 1977 and even now there really isn’t anything else like it. The closest thing I can think of is Takashi Miike’s *The Happiness of the Katakuris*, and even that isn’t all that similar. The fact that *House* remains a thoroughly unique experience over forty years later is a testament to Ôbayashi’s singular vision and the range of techniques he used to realize it.",

For me, the best viewing experience I maybe have ever had was watching TWBB completely blind for the first time. I literally knew absolutely nothing about the movie. It was surreal to me. This random used bookstore bluray pickup that I had maybe heard of before couldn't actually be a new top five all-time movie for me? Could it? It was just so astounding. Every moment was incredible. I distinctly remember actually having my jaw drop by the time Tchaikovsky started playing. It would be hard for me to overstate how perfect this movie is and how much I adore it. Can't wait to watch it again.\n2. **The Vanishing**\\- just to clarify, I am referring to the original 1988 film. I have never seen the remake and I have no intention of ever doing so. That being said, for those who have seen this movie, it should be obvious why I wish I could see this again knowing nothing. One of the best endings in the entire medium. I can't recommend it enough. Be wary of reading descriptions and reviews online, though. The best way to experience it (with any movie, really, but this in particular) is blind. To be fair, sometimes I get a little bit annoyed when all anyone talks about in regards to The Vanishing is its ending. The entire movie is incredibly well constructed and written. One of the more tense films you are likely to ever see.\n3. **Seven**\\- this is a movie that I feel a little sad about. Not because of its content. It's because I can't help but think that it will always have diminishing returns. Maybe I'm wrong about that. I hope I am. Currently, it is my favorite Fincher film and I've seen it a few times. It still induces dread and terror incredibly well, but nothing will ever compare to that first time watching it. Similarly to TWBB, I went in basically knowing absolutely nothing. I didn't know the cast, the plot, the ending. Nothing. Thankfully, I think that Zodiac, which was my #2 Fincher, has more rewatchability.",

Psychological aspect of the film and the connection it had with mental illnesses also made me realize once more that the film gets its \"hatred\" mistakenly. \n\nI liked the character arcs and their stories. Finally, It was extremely atmospheric. The visuals create a mysterious setting that makes you invested in the story throughout the whole film.\n\nEasily, 8/10.",

I just knew about it because I wanted to study Kubrick's works.. so I downloaded all his filmography..\n\nAlso, when it's mentioned it's usually praised for the usage of odd lenses by Kubrick, candle lit scenes (which was not the case for all interior scenes btw) .. at least that's what you'll find by searching Youtube for essays about the movie, while most other good movies are widely discussed from all perspectives by said essays..\n\nThis movie has stunning visuals, great acting, superb music, the setting, costume &amp; set design, the story is engaging and tragic, I was deeply invested in it and it's a memorable story that I was touched with personally, but it's not discussed enough.\n\nI like talking about movies I like, and love reading and watching other people's perspectives.. every movie that catches my attention I spend hours after watching it surfing the internet watching essays, reading trivia &amp; goofs, searching for theories &amp; watching specials &amp; interviews with the creators of the movie.. I find most of my favorite movies covered, but not this one.\n\nSo, I think that's one example that shows that a critically acclaimed movie can be somewhat forgotten about, thus *feels* \"underrated\".",

        "text": "Before I Fall is certainly one of the strangest movies I have seen and I think this movie will be very polarizing. It deals with emotional themes and I know some people are uncomfortable with that, but I think it did that very well.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn the surface this movie is cheap rip-off of groundhog day with teenage girls, cheesy morals and boring/clunky dialog. It's a film that could fit in with your average girly TV and melodrama that has become standard such in mediocre shows. I know what you're wondering, why do I like this movie? I am obviously not a great fan of kitsch and this movie radiates with it. If you're planning to watch it, I will warn you: Don't turn off after the first half of the movie, it won't show you anything. You might think this movie is about your classic story of a girl that needs to grow up to finish high school and become a good person. And it is, but if you only see the first layer to it it's terrible. The movie needs time to establish it's play ground and it deserves my high praise because it uses that playground of teenage drama to slowly build up tension. It's like loading up a gun and firing it at right moment to hit a bullseye. Then the echos of that shot deliver what really hits home. If you aren't open to that, you probably won't like this movies. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn a second layer this movie deals with a girl that loses her ego and becomes a better person. A girl that finds peace and love. To be more precise it deals with the theme of how people mature. Everywhere there are these signs and symbols that hint to philosophy but they are placed so obviously and are so in your face that you basically ignore them. For example the theme Sisyphus looks like it's there because it kinda fits the whole groundhog day idea. Cheesy and boring. But it plays multiple purposes and hides in plain sight that it's also about the monotony of life. That we forget to love people we love that we get lost in a machinery life that makes us put one foot before the other, carrying our personal burdens, never sharing and never caring. Never allowing us to actually feel because we've become numb in our personal hell. Therein lies the brilliancy of this movie. When the pieces come together and you see that beautiful picture Russo-Young tries to paint. The movie definitely deceives it's viewers in that sense. You make expectations by what you see in the beginning and judge off that and wonder how the story plays out. The point is that this movie takes a more simplistic approach, it condensates what in principle all stories are really about: to sell an idea to an audience. What I mean by that is that the story is irrelevant, it's only the medium. That is of course very bold and is bound to backfire to some extend (bad reviews on rotten tomatoes and imdb). Our protagonist lives a very unhappy life but she can't figure out what's wrong. She gets more and more frustrated with life and takes an aggressive nihilistic stance. Her nihilistic approach then metamorphs into martyry, a bit like the ending from groundhog day. Russo-Young or Lauren Oliver or whoever came up with it, saw so much more potential after that. None of her actions really fix her. Now comes a key scene in the movie (for those of you who have seen it, I'm talking about when she finds out why the accident that takes her back happened at all). For the first time she tries to take an open look at her life. She objectively sees how she and her friends have been running over other people. How she caused harm and despair, that in her martyry she tried to fix the world and change everyone for the better and how she behaves towards them but never really herself. Then she accepts what I can only describe as positive nihilism. She loves other people in her life. She breaks down her own barrier and reveals herself to her loved ones. She accepts life and death. That is the final challenge she had to overcome.",

        "text": " Her. There we have, a movie that I really like. This film is absurdly postmodern, which is something I really like, since overall I guess I'm kind of a postmodern person (not in all aspects,but in a lot of them). The movie's beauty and sensitiveness shows a slightly brighter side to the postmodern persona that most people see of postmodernity; the movie shows it like I think I see it, melancholic, kind of nihilist and hopeless most of the times; but also sensitive and beautiful in its apparently absurd nuances.\n\n That's not my favorite thing about the movie I like the most, though. Since my high school literature classes with different romance stories of different types of movements (romantism,arcadism,etc) untill I played Doki Doki Literature Club, I discovered that I really like artworks that try to define love and try to challange its traditional meaning. Maybe that's because I think love is just like happyness, a concept everybody thinks that knows the definition of, but actually cannot explain or can explain only with vague and overly simple responses.\n\n Her is my favorite movie to do that does it, but I would really like to know other ones that do as well. I also wanna know your definition for love in our current context. Leave a comment ;)",

I got the satire, the characters and dialogues were pretty good, some themes like the name of the characters were certainly interesting etc, and it was a good movie. But that's where it ends. How is it 'one of the bests of all time' is beyond me. People really think this is one of the best movie ever made? Really? I understand that the context of when it was released was important, but there's supposed to be a point to 'all time bests'.\n\nI have found this to be the case with several classics. Many of them are great but I feel a lot of them seem to get overrated by people's nostalgia. Those who probably saw it during their hay day seems to remember loving it and slowing it becomes an 'all time best' when in reality isn't really. ",
