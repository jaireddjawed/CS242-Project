Before you post here, please be aware that this is not a \"parents helping parents\" subreddit.  The purpose of Internet Parents is to provide parental type support to people who need it and don't have it.  We're here to be parents on the Internet.  \n\nThe subreddit name doesn't mean \"parents helping parents\" it means \"stand-in parents helping people who don't have parents\" or, at least, not parents they can go to for help with a particular situation.  \n\nSometimes, these things do cross over.  After all, if I need parenting advice with my son, I might want to talk to my own parents about that.  Because of this cross over, we do sometimes let \"I'm a parent, give me advice\" posts stand, but **that is the exception, not the rule**.  \n\nIn general, posts by parents that are looking for child-rearing advice are considered to be completely inappropriate for this sub and such posts are usually **locked and removed**, no questions asked.\n\nIf you are a parent seeking help from other parents, try \/r\/Parents or \/r\/Parenting or \/r\/ChildCare, or one of a thousand other subs out there that exist for that purpose.  This sub is not one of them.  Thank you.  ","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1554608177.0},{"title":"We Need Mods!

In the fall semester I audition for honor bands. I've made it to all-state band twice in my two years of high school. I also do Student Council, which takes up 30 minutes a week. On occasion I help with stuff, maybe once every two months. It may take up an afternoon or a Saturday. I also recently got a part time job. I'm not 16 yet,  but when I turn 16 it'll probably be maximum 12 hours of work a week. Probably mostly on the weekend and a little on a weekday.\n\nI'm also probably going to be doing some ACT prep somewhere in there, and probably scholarship applications and college apps.\n\nAm I super overloading myself? I am looking into being a junior class officer next year, but might not. I'm not a stranger to hard work, I take honors classes and do really well (grades above 95%). I work really hard for band. Do you think I have time for extracurriculars if I use my time smartly and get my homework done? Do college classes even have that much homework? Will I still have just a little time at least to hang out with friends and family, and a little time to myself? Or am I doomed to be super stressed. Could I still get about 8 hours of sleep a night on this schedule? I could devote about half of my Sundays to schoolwork if I needed to.\n\nAnd answers are welcome, I'm sorry for the huge amount of text. I'm kinda panicking and feel like I might regret doing too much in high school.

Will he be mad at me for being such an inconvenience? What if he can't afford it either?

I\u2019ve blown her off not only the time last week, but also the countless other times that I didn\u2019t want to say her name to my mom. But once again I am afraid of mentioning her to my mom. Is it wrong for me to keep avoiding my friend just because of the discomfort of my mom ranting about her being trans?\n\nI can\u2019t drive or walk to the party by myself and none of my friends as far as I can tell are invited. As I see it my options are to either make up the 100th shitty excuse for why I can\u2019t go to something with my friend, to just ignore her invitation and not go, explain to her why I\u2019ve been avoiding her, or suck it up and ask my mom for a ride to her birthday party.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do.

I really need help and advice for something my parents just aren't able to.\n\nI'm 22F. My thoughts about this consume me constantly through every single day, especially the last year. \n\nI graduated college this past May with a biomedical degree. I've just been accepted to dental school. \n\nI am very happy but at the same time I'm so scared. In the last year, my priorities have changed a lot. All I want to do is see the world. I see people all the time my age traveling and I don't know how to do so. I'm scared if I go to dental school I won't be able to see the world for the next 4 years then I'll get stuck working a forever. I'm scared of the work-go to sleep life style. I am ok with it becaude I know it is a part of life, but I'm drowning being stuck in Michigan.\n\nI hate living in Michigan and my parents guilt me so horribly bad everyday about wanting to move. I want to move to Florida with every ounce of me. The only way they would let me is if my job allowed me to do so. \n\nBeing a dentist has been my dream my whole life, but I'm scared I'll be stuck and not be able to do what I dream of (travel and or move to Florida)\n\nI've thought of getting my piolets license but I won't be able to afford that in dental schools. I've through of switching to sales but I'm scared or regretting turning down dental school.\n\nWhen I see people working a normal job on the beach, I'm jealous. I don't need all the money in the world. I don't even care about having a lot of money. I just want to be somewhere warm and I want to be happy. I don't know how to be able to travel and I don't know how to leave mochigan or how to afford leaving Michigan because my parents won't let me. Unless I got into school or something down there. But they'd make me come back after.\n\nIs there just a normal job I can work that allows me to go to different parts of the world? I just want to be living somewhere with plum trees and an ocean. I'm willing to work any job. I don't want to finally get out of Michigan when I'm too old. I just want to see the world and I'm willing to do any type of work.\n\n\nI'm scared if I become a dentist I'll be stuck in one location and never be able to travel.  But I do love dentistry with all my heart. I'm scared that I won't be able to move to Florida after dental school because my parents are in Michigan and will guilt me if my kids grow up in Florida  while they are in Michigan. But I hate it here, I can't spend my whole life in Michigan. I'm so unhappy and no matter what is happening if I see people my age in another country or just living in Florida working any type of job I just can't help myself but be so jealous. I can't spend my whole life this way. Does anyone have any type of advice for me?

Since I was like 14 or 15 my mom started warning me to do not hang out with younger kids because someone might think I'm a creep. I have no idea where she got this idea at the time, because I was socially awkward, I still am, and was heavily bullied, so I wasn't hanging out with my peers, and even less with younger kids. She also started warning me about not being inappropriate or looking to girls in the wrong way. Again, I wasn't interested in someone and I dont think any women had interest in me. Her tone wasn't educational like \"respect girls\" she was always accusatory, like if I had a record, but no, I did never bring anyone home, never dated anyone, and had no friends.\n\nThis got worse as I got older, and became a legal adult, she constantly talked about news she saw of Pedos being caught and jailed, and always ended up with her warning me and telling me to behave because pedophiles get killed in jail. Again, I dont know where she got these ideas because I was never around kids, I dont like kids, I dont want to be a father, my job has nothing to do with kids, we dont live any near school, I'm a single child and have no relationship with my cousins. \n\nSometimes I can just forget that kids exist at all. But for some reason, my mom always warned me because if I looked at a kid the wrong way I could end up in jail.\n\nWhen I was 21, I tried dating a girl I've meet at college who was 19. We went to the movies one day. I made the mistake to tell her where was I going and she interrogated me about her. She told me I was creeping on her and she was too young. Anyway, we never dated because she wasn't really interested in me, as always, so we stayed friends until she dropped out and went to another college in another city. But I still think that was very hypocritical of her because my dad is 20 years older than my mom.\n\nAnyway, because of all of this, I have some kind of anxiety or fear when I'm near any kid, what if I look at them the wrong way and I end up in jail? What if they walk too close to me and the parents think I'm being a creep and beat me up? What if I'm looking into the void and some woman standing in that direction think I'm creeping out on her?\n\nSo, yesterday a neighbor of mine, who is a school principal asked me for a favor, to fix some software problems in the school computer lab. I wasn't sure, but sounded easy so I accepted. I went there, the kids where still in school but I managed to avoid them to go straight to the principal's office and then to the lab. When I got there were still some kids at the lab using the computers to finish some homework. I just sat and did what I needed to do, but I was nervous, at least the principal was there and only talked to her, but I was scared to even look in the other direction of make eye contact with some kid. I kept my eyes on the screen or my phone until the kids finally left.\n\nI did part of the job, but couldn't finish other parts because I needed to get more software, so I will come back tomorrow.\n\nMy mom haven't really made more of the comments in recent years, but they still resonate in my head, and yesterday I realized I need to somehow fix it, It is not normal to be scared just by being in the same 10 meters radius with a kid or a woman, because of this fear that they might think Im creepy. \n\nHelp?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678381031.0},{"title":"Mom and dad I think I might be having an existential crisis, genuinely worried and concerned.","author":"Antique_Crow_4252","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/11mvydt\/mom_and_dad_i_think_i_might_be_having_an\/","text":"\\*For background information you can look up my last post on this subreddit\\*\n\nMom and Dad,\n\nthings are confusing.

A big part of me knows that I might not belong here and maybe I should be studying somewhere else, but I am worried. I am worried even if i retake the entrance exam and somehow manage to get in my fav university things will be the same and I will not be able to fit in.\n\nnext thing that I keep struggling about is my dreams, most od my dreams are unrealistic, and big mostly scientific achievements which first I have no idea what is the path towards them and second am not sure if I have enough talent to get them, I might also add I do not trust myself because I feel like I am not consistant enough. It is a point of being extremely well-aware but putting zero effort to change yourself.\n\nIs it too bad that I don't want to include my family in my future? I get this guilt whenever I think about it, It is not that they are bad people or anything it is a sense that I don't feel that **I belong here**, and whenever I try to explain it to anyone they can't understand me because from outside with logical calculations, there is no reason for not wanting to include them but from the inside I don't want to.\n\nAnd lastly, is the act of chasing love.

I just want to start off by saying that I am not based in the US. I recently graduated with a law degree and in my country, one of the prerequisites for becoming an attorney is sort of a practical training\/intern year where you work at a law firm. It is incredibly difficult to find a placement and a lot of people wait years for a spot. \n\nI was lucky enough to land a spot at a firm at the end of last year. It\u2019s really close to where I live and the pay is very good. I started in January of this year, and have been here for two months. The firm is really small which means I get to work on a lot of different things on my own without much supervision. I prefer to work that way because it\u2019s the best way I learn. \n\nI\u2019m not a traditional candidate in the sense that I\u2019m almost 32, have previous qualifications, had a career, and decided to go back to university to study law. Most people in this type of role in my country are 23, 24, fresh out of university, with no real work experience. \n\nThe past two months at my current firm have been hell. When I decided to pursue law, I was aware of the fact that a lot of firms are toxic workplaces and that abuse was rife, but I never imagined it would happen at this level. There are only three of us at the firm, the director, myself, and then one other intern. From the beginning, there was a severe lack of training and no onboarding whatsoever. My go-to person for questions is the other intern who often doesn\u2019t know the answer himself. Fine, I can deal with that because I can figure most things out myself, it just takes me longer. \n\nThe worst thing about working here is the director. He is in his sixties and refuses to learn how to use technology. This means that I have to type his emails and his documents, which I don\u2019t mind doing because I am learning a lot but he takes \u2018breaks\u2019 every 5 minutes to have personal phone calls and watch videos on his phone. So I have to sit there and wait for him before I can get back to my work. He gets angry if a make even the slightest of typos or if, god forbid, Word formats something wrong. He also insists on dictating everything to me, but then gets angry (like red-in-the-face rage) if I spell a name wrong or if I mishear what he says. I\u2019ve asked him (politely) to just give me the paper with the information on it because it would reduce the number of mistakes I make significantly, but he refused and looked at me like I was an idiot. He yelled at me and accused me of putting the numbers on his computer in caps lock on purpose. I clarified and asked if he meant that it was bolded because it was, but then he went on a rant telling me that he knows what the difference is between caps lock and bolded and that I had capitalized the numbers on his computer. I just stared at him shocked.  \n\nHe constantly criticizes everything I do. Even if I do something perfectly, he complains because I didn\u2019t make enough space on the page for his signature. He constantly tells me that I work too slowly, that I look like I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on like my head is in the clouds, and that I\u2019m not working hard enough or quickly enough. He full-on screamed at me in my second week because I didn\u2019t know where a file was kept. Nobody told me where the files were kept. He gave me an hour to write something I\u2019ve never done before which has to adhere to a lot of specifications. I was so anxious that I made a lot of mistakes, stupid mistakes, that I know are stupid mistakes. I told him that I know that my mistake was rushing the documents and that if I just slowed down and focused I know I wouldn\u2019t make those mistakes. Again, he got red in the face angry and told me that I make mistakes because \u201cI don\u2019t have enough adrenaline running through my veins\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m terrified of my boss. His mere presence gives me anxiety. A month in I was hospitalized for three days because I had developed severe gastritis and an ulcer from the stress. When I got back to work, he yelled at me about work I didn\u2019t do while I was in the hospital. He expects me to meet targets but hasn\u2019t given me any tools or training to meet those targets. He constantly threatens my job. He constantly threatens to throw his phone\/glass\/computer screen at me. This is a huge man, double my size. \n\nI know myself, I know I make stupid mistakes if I\u2019m too anxious to focus. I work best in an environment with positive reinforcement. I know I don\u2019t always work the fastest, but I work hard, and I always give my best.  \n\nAfter I was released from the hospital, I decided to start looking for another job. Last week I got an interview at another firm. I haven\u2019t received an offer but it seems like they are really interested in me. The only problem is I\u2019m terrified of leaving this place only to step into something much, much worse. In the interview, they constantly emphasized how hard they worked, how much pressure it was, and how many hours they worked. The firm seems much nicer, there are more people there, and they seem a lot more professional but I\u2019ve encountered a few red flags during the interviewing process. I would also be doing a lot of work in an area of practice that I\u2019m not very interested in.  Leaving my current firm is also going to be a logistical nightmare and I\u2019m literally terrified that my current boss will harm me if I were to give notice. \n\nThe nice thing about my current firm is that the hours are fairly consistent, in that we finish at 17:00 every day and I get to work in an area of practice that I\u2019m really interested in. When my boss is in a good mood it\u2019s a nice working environment and he teaches me a lot but 95% of the time he treats me like I\u2019m an absolute idiot. My natural inclination is to avoid my boss because I\u2019m afraid of him, so sometimes I leave things too long which I know contributes to the problem. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve tried to learn to cope with my current boss but my efforts lead to my being hospitalized. I\u2019m terrified of leaving this place and then going to a place that\u2019s even worse. What if I can\u2019t cope with the workload and pressure at the new place and they fire me? Things were better this week but then again my boss was very busy and has left me alone for the most part. \n\nTLDR: I am a law graduate who has been interning at a law firm for two months. The director of the firm is abusive and yells at me for even the slightest mistake. I'm expected to know things but no training is provided. I've been hospitalized with gastritis and an ulcer due to stress and am genuinely afraid of the director. I had an interview at another firm but there were some red flags in the interview. If offered a position, I am hesitant to leave because what if the situation is a lot worse?","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678277533.0},{"title":"Please just believe in me..","author":"temporarilyinhabited","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/11mdjy1\/please_just_believe_in_me\/","text":"My parents, suck. I call my mom when I want to know what not to do. She's spiteful and impulsive. I call my dad when I want to know what to do without people pleasing, because he is ruthlessly narcissistic. \n\nRecently, I've had a downward spiral. I was living with my dad, trying to get back on my feet after a bad breakup, and he lost his mind one night. I was upstairs, and he came in screaming. I had forgotten to clean something and he was livid. I knew he wasn't actually upset about the unclean thing. He had just been told about an hour earlier that his brother was going to stop receiving cancer treatment and most likely die. I asked him not to yell at me, tried to reason with him, and he just screamed more. He backed me into the door, so close to my face that he was spitting on me, and I ran inside the door, locked it, and just laid on the floor crying. I was transported back to being a little kid, when he would actually hit me and hurt me, and I was so scared. I didn't feel safe.\n\nI ran away, to a friend's that I barely knew. It didn't work out there for more than a week or so. I moved around the country couch surfing, but mostly living in my car for about four months, until I just couldn't anymore. I called my brother to see if he had any space, he didn't and he's having marital problems. He told my dad.\n\nMy dad acted like I was totally fine to come back and work through things. That isn't the case. When I got there he just told me how badly I had hurt him by lying about the events that took place, and telling my brother and mom that he made me feel unsafe, when 'I knew I was safe the whole time'. I broke down. I told him I wanted to go to a mental hospital, that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. I drove to one that night and admitted myself to inpatient care. I couldn't stay longer than the 72 hour suicide hold because my insurance is in another state. \n\nWhen I came back to my dad's, he told me that he hoped that I had learned that mental health is a 'crock of shit'. He said he doesn't want to hear any more about my autism being a 'disability', and if I ever say I feel suicidal again, it's manipulative and he 'will not stand for it'. I don't know what that means, but I am scared to bring up my mental health now. He makes me come out of my room after I get home from working so he can tell me that he doesn't trust me and doesn't believe I can do it (get myself out of this hole), and reminds me that I'm only here because no one else wants me and 'he really doesn't either'. \n\nI have to stay until I have somewhere else to go and can support myself. That's what my mom, grandma, and brother are saying. 'Keep your head down' 'You know how he is' 'You wouldn't be here if you were independent' I understand that, and I'm working every day to get out, but how do I keep it together until then? I have some not-close friendships, but I don't want to always vent to them and ruin the friendships. I know when people say 'hey how are you' they don't really want to know. This just all feels like so much and I feel more like dying than ever. I want to be strong. To grow up and be an adult and support myself, but it feels like I'm at the bottom of this huge mountain and my own dad is standing at the top, spitting on me and throwing rocks. I need help. I need a real dad.

It\u2019s a short time, but I really really like him. The past couple of weeks have been rough. I was always worried that he wouldn\u2019t b attracted to women, and when I got curious and asked some of his friends if they knew if he was gay, they didn\u2019t react well and just awkwardly kept saying ummmm. Obviously I felt awful for even asking them cause I didn\u2019t want them to feel pressured to out him if he wasn\u2019t open about being gay - and so I apologized. \n\nThen, out of nowhere, last week my best frien and I saw him walking with a girl and when he was walking towards us he was holding her hand, and then introduced her. My best friend, being a social butterfly led the conversation. Meanwhile a part of me was listening to my friend speak to them in the background and a  part of me was blacked out. I really couldn\u2019t believe. It. \n\nWhen I saw my crush holding hands with her, at that very second I thought I was dreaming and I was hoping it wasn\u2019t him. It was like a scene from a movie wherein the girl actually runs into the girlfriend and not hearing about the relationship through the grapevine. \n\nI was in shock as I was so focused on him possibly being gay and the fact that my best friend asked him if he had a girlfriend a couple of weeks ago and he said no. \n\nNot surprising, I broke down crying when I got home. \n\nThis was last Friday, and I\u2019ve cried everyday since then. \n\nI know you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cIt\u2019s just a crush, you\u2019re overreacting, it should have taken you just a weekend to clear your head,etc.  \u201c\n\nBut if I think about it, it\u2019s a little more than that. He\u2019s in one of my hardest classes and it\u2019s hard for me to focus knowing that he\u2019s there. Also, I feel insecure a lot because he is one of the smartest people while I\u2019m struggling to b average and I feel like I don\u2019t deserve to be with him or that I won\u2019t be good enough. I\u2019m in law school so I feel a lot of pressure about doing well and being adequate. I\u2019ve spent a lot of mental energy because of my feelin for him and my insecurities. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to ask is, considering all the details above, how long until I don\u2019t feel the pain anymore? \n\nI\u2019m afraid that i\u2019m just being pathetic rn with the way I am processing this. \n\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far, thanks for reading. \n\n\nTLDR: really like this guy, thought he was single or not into women, ran into him and his girlfriend out of the blue, and not taking it well.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678264250.0},{"title":"I'm going to get my Master's degree next month and I'm relieved and scared at the same time","author":"soymilksoysauce","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/11kyjpn\/im_going_to_get_my_masters_degree_next_month_and\/","text":"I am 27 so I guess I should have eventually seen this coming.

I'd usually turn to my Dad with this question, but Dad's not around for me in this physical plane anymore. So I turn to you for guidance.\n\nRecently, a tree fell partially on our house from the recent rains and wind we've had in California. My security camera showed that it took about an hour to fall so it was a slow descent. However, it took down a support post for my unattached patio before it stopped moving. (So patio is destroyed.) The trunk is firmly on the ground, but the upper branches are on the roof of my house.\n\nI filed a claim for home insurance to do an inspection to come take a look and hopefully cover the costs of removal, patio damages (i'm not sure if that's covered though) and any superficial damages to house. However, It doesn't look like there's any damage at all, but I can't be certain. I feel like it's in my gut instinct to not touch anything until they look at it.\n\nHowever, when the incident immediately happened, we had someone come in to clear some of the   branches away because it was partially resting on my neighbor's power line. I didn't want this problem to get worse so it was immediately addressed. (I did take photos before they did that work.)\n\nOther than that, the tree is still mostly here... branches on the roof and all.\n\nI have to wait 5 more days for insurance to come out an inspect things.\n\nSo I'm wondering if it's at all worth it to get insurance involved anymore.

If my claim gets denied, would I be punished still with a higher insurance rate in the future? Just wondering if I should go out of pocket or let insurance handle it.

I read from the doctors' Yelp reviews that they had successfully cured patients' acne, helped women struggling in labor give birth more easily, all that good stuff.\n\nAnd what do I do, by contrast? Make slides, do Excel, and help businesses do headcount analyses (aka help businesses lay people off).\n\nI'm 23.

Ultimately, when I did get in touch with him he said \"oh you're still doing that?\" and it turned out the client backed out and they're delaying the project anyway. Nobody bothered to tell me. The spreadsheet I worked on for weeks had 0 views. \n\nMy supervisor said something to the effect of \"don't overwhelm (other attorney)\" and I said yeah, I don't think he's gotten a chance to look at the spreadsheet yet. My supervisor shifted to \"make sure you're concise for that reason\". I said to some degree, if I'm sending less information I'm doing my job less well (for this specific project due to details I won't get into) and it would be ideal if they have a large repository to reference. Supervisor's reply was \"could be helpful for you to organize info\"\n\nI was frustrated at this point because my spreadsheets were meticulously organized. My supervisor glanced at them for 4 seconds, not long enough to know if they were organized or not, and the other attorney didn't even open the file. So nobody knows enough about my work to even say if it's concise, or organized, or not. \n\nI get that attorneys are busy and don't begrudge it if someone doesn't have time to look, but I do begrudge my supervisor's automatic assumption that it was *my* fault if he didn't look, and the general leaving me out of the loop. (Which is consistent -- in other examples, people leave me out of an email thread so I don't see a most recent draft, then have me copy all my comments over because I missed the recent draft.)\n\nCompounding this, I find it demoralizing that all our communication is online and consistently I'll be mid-conversation with my supervisor at 10am and he'll suddenly disappear and ignore my question (on Slack) for 24 hours or more with no explanation, and not even as little as a \"let me get back to you.\" \n\nOf course, it's just a status\/seniority thing because it would be totally inappropriate for me to ignore an attorney's question for 24 hours or more with no explanation. It just feels disrespectful. \n\nI get that as an entry-level employee I'm low on the totem pole, but I guess I'm feeling frustrated because at the same time I'm in my late twenties, this isn't my first job, and I just want to feel like a colleague instead of an intern. \n\nGenerally my supervisor encourages me to go to him with any concerns, but I can't think of an appropriate way to articulate this problem that isn't offensive to him as my superior. \n\nThanks for any insight or advice.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677808031.0},{"title":"Need help \ud83d\ude4f","author":"Old_Bookkeeper_6829","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/11g4dh8\/need_help\/","text":"[In reference to the previous post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/118tj0m\/i_need_help_to_understand_what_is_happening_to_me\/) I wanted to ask you a question, a few nights ago I was coming back from an evening out with my friends and to put less time on it I passed on the road where the pharmacist in my small town had a fatal accident.

I would really appreciate some advice and feedback to see if I am making the smart move in picking the apartment that I have. I apologize in advance for such a long post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little backstory: I am currently living in what, in my area, is called an efficiency. I apologize if you are already familiar with the term, but I have found it is not very well known outside of my surrounding city. It is basically part of someone's house that has had a wall put up separating our two living areas. I have my own private entrance and a sizeable yard, but no kitchen. I currently spend about $600 or 11% of my monthly income on ubereats, not counting the few groceries I buy such as frozen snacks to prepare in the air fryer and ingredients to make sandwiches. It is incredibly frustrating to try and prepare anything that requires chopping as I don't even have a sink other than the one located in the bathroom. I would very much like to be able to cook for myself and my guests. The house is owned by a family member whom I love dearly but we argue constantly, and I think I must move out for the sake of my sanity as well as to preserve what is left of our relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe building I am looking at has two units available, a 1\/1 and a studio. Both have a 15 month lease. Neither includes water, trash, electric or internet. The 1\/1 has a washer and dryer, a tiny balcony and enough space for a decent living room and even a dining table. The studio has no w&d, no balcony, and would fit only my bed and my tv stand but is $350 less. They both have nice kitchens. My commute would remain unchanged as my current place and the new apt are both near my job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI calculated that my housing cost for the 1\/1 would be about 42% of my income which is more than double what I am currently paying, however with access to a real kitchen my food costs would be slashed in half, and I would have access to a pool as well as a gym.  It is a lot more than I am currently paying but it should probably be taken into consideration that my current price of rent is a steal, and the price of the apt is pretty average for my area. There are a few places that are about the same price and even larger than the apt, but the commute would be awful and frankly they are just not as nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter paying off my monthly bills such as utilities, health insurance, car insurance, gas, phone, groceries (I project about $300\/month however I really don't know), my ROTH IRA (not provided by my employer), investing an additional $500 monthly, my savings would be about $1k. Is that ok or should I opt for the studio and save an extra $350 monthly? If it makes a difference, between ubereats and amazon I don't currently have any savings outside of the total amount to move in. I have been blessed these last several years with high income and low bills and have gone on way too many trips, seen too many concerts, taken said family member on several vacations and to many nice dinners. However I have also been cursed because money seems to burn a hole in my pocket, lol. I believe that it is not so much that I am irresponsible as it is that I've just been spoiled to be honest and just didn't ever really need to think about how much I'm spending. I am positive that with finally having my own kitchen and being happy to have my own privacy for once, I will no longer overspend. For the record, I have good credit (744 TransUnion and 739 Equifax according to Credit Karma), no debt, and I only go out to dinner maybe twice a month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs this a good idea or am I crazy? I see only pros should I make this move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so very much for reading.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677722333.0},{"title":"Should I drop \/ withdraw from this class or should I continue to spiral?","author":"lecollegekid","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/11ftum8\/should_i_drop_withdraw_from_this_class_or_should\/","text":" \n\n>*Should I stay or should I go?*\n\nI am currently taking a gen-ed mathematics course and it is driving me insane.

Spouse and I are the only ones that know and I\u2019m not sure we if should inform everyone \n\nFull Backstory: My spouse and I are involved heavily in a club type sport where everyone on the team and adjacent to the team are friends or at least friendly with each other. We, my spouse and I, had one other couple we were super close with. Like inner circle close. And the wife let\u2019s call her \u201cD\u201d got a sudden cancer diagnosis. After hearing the treatment plan from her Doc D breaks down in tears to me about not having enough money to survive cancer and pay rent. So I jump into action and start a go-fund-me and get everyone on the team and in the periphery to donate. \n\nThankfully D has halfway decent insurance and through our efforts and a bit of extra money from us, we manage to cover all the costs of D\u2019s treatments. We even get D\u2019s partner a better paying job. We feel like hero\u2019s.\n\nWell, D survives the year long treatments and two days after her final treatment we learn from D\u2019s partner that they are thinking of buying a house and have $100k saved up for the down payment.\n\nSounds fishy, so I talk to D about it. It seemed odd to me that you\u2019d cry to me about not being able to pay for your medical care while you have so much money in the bank. D confesses that they had $40k before the cancer diagnosis and because of disability, unemployment and our go-fund-me they didn\u2019t have any other expenses so they just pocketed all the extra money. But that all of that is none of business because their finances are a private matter and none of our business. \n\nI was livid and ended our friendship right then and there.\n\nNow I\u2019m trying to figure out if I need to warn all of the other people that donated via go-fund-me that D lied about needing help. \n\nI\u2019m just so mad and frustrated and honestly can\u2019t even think straight.

Am I being used?","author":"leftover-pizza-","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/11egb69\/i_am_18_he_is_26_is_this_age_difference_always\/","text":"Really hope he isn\u2019t on this sub, but anyways. \n\nPlease help me judge this situation. I am very lost. \n\nI am an 18 year old girl, currently seeing a 26 old man. I\u2019ve known him for 7 months. We met through an exchange program where he works as a volunteer, and I am a student. \n\nWe kind of started out as friends. We share a lot of hobbies, interests and the same sense of humor. There was always this weird tension though, especially from my side, as I really liked him and therefore found it hard to fully relax around him. At some point I did notice he seemed to pay me a lot of attention. He would initiate basically all of our conversations, compliment me on outfits, and hug me a lot. He is very affectionate with all of his friends though, so I didn\u2019t read too much into this.\n\nOne day I apologized for acting off earlier that day. He asked to go on a walk and he then confessed his feelings for me, stuttering and stammering and all. I told him I felt the same way, he acted very relieved. Told me he had been feeling like that for months, had been throwing up from the anxiety of it, had tried to distract himself but nothing really worked. \n\nHe tells me there is \u2018something about me\u2019, that he thinks I\u2019m interesting, that he thinks he wants me and wants to get to know me and cares \u2018so fucking much\u2019 for me. I asked him about the age difference, he says he\u2019s thought about it and cares but he isn\u2019t \u2018that\u2019 old, is in his twenties, and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s purposefully going after 18 year olds, etc. He has told a friend of his, encouraged me to tell someone as well once I felt comfortable enough with that. \n\nI am just having a really hard time judging all of this rationally as I am so caught up in the emotion of it. On the one hand, he has consistently been there to make sure I\u2019m okay. The fact he told a friend tells me that he\u2019s not trying to be too secretive around it, outside the fact that this relationship is kind of taboo so we are currently hiding it from teachers and other students. But he told me that if it does get out, it gets out, and we\u2019re gonna have to talk about it with the headmaster, but \u2018we\u2019ll have each other\u2019. He has not been overly pushy about things like sex. \n\nOn the other hand, that is an 8 year age difference we\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s been through uni, I still need to apply. He\u2019s never been anything but nice and considerate but I can\u2019t shake this feeling of distrust, and I don\u2019t know if that is due to healthy intuition or my raging insecurity and trust issues. Or both. I\u2019ve tried discussing my worries with him and he\u2019s been responsive, but I am not sure if I feel fully understood. When I shared this, he said he thought it was because it will take time to understand each other. He does seem a little bit immature for his age, not necessarily in a bad way. Is he just an emotionally clumsy guy with the right intentions, or is he purposefully trying to avoid the discussion? \n\nAs for me, I do like him. The \u2018butterflies\u2019 and nervousness are all there, but I have wondered if this is because I really like him, or more the idea of him, or if it\u2019s rather because he is someone I crave validation from. I am hesitant to break it off because I\u2019ve spent a lot of time wanting this, and I don\u2019t want to ruin a possibly good thing because of what could be overthinking and insecurity. \n\nBut I guess what I fear is being used. I worry if I opened up too much about my past and my issues without fully trusting him and made myself more vulnerable. Please, help me judge this situation as you more experienced, less naive adults do. \n\nThank you.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1677609831.0},{"title":"How to come to terms with cutting a parent out of your life?","author":"pineapplez4dayz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/11er39v\/how_to_come_to_terms_with_cutting_a_parent_out_of\/","text":"I recently went no contact with my parents after many years of managing relational trauma and cPTSD.

Kinda an update, kinda me asking for help again but. Either way, not a super happy post. :'3\n\nSo a while ago I posted here and a few other advice subs asking for help to get on my feet and stay away from my mother. And I got some great advice back, I wrote everything down as best as I could, did everything I could within my ability to. Things were going okay-!\n\nAaaand then sht hit the fan. Again. \n\nMy Mamaw wasn't a super great person herself (which I didn't expect perfection, she's way older, but jesus christ). Was pretty controlling, and though it wasn't nearly as bad as my mother. It wasn't great. Pretty good for rent free though, and I feel stupid now for acting like I did. \n\nIt wasn't a superb situation but I was doing super well. So I thought maybe I could see my mom again, get a chance to check on my brother (who lived with her. He's her baby, he was fine) and like. Try to set healthy boundaries. \n\nShould've listened and waited, because she roped me back in with her the minute she heard i was the slightest bit disgruntled. Which is. Mostly my fault, I know. But I really did want to just have a relationship with her. She's the only mom I've got, ya know? It feels wrong to just drop her. And my bubba.\n\nBut point is. Because of this BS bridges have been burnt and I'm stuck here again. And now I don't even have my dog to get me through it (She's better off where she is- but it still hurts like hell). \n\nI'm broke again and trying to find remote jobs I could maybe learn to do (because my mom travels). I have a decent laptop, and thought math isn't my strongest point. I can figure it out. That or just somewhere I can go or be that'll help. I'm currently in New Mexico in the middle of nowhere but we've been moving around the country. I can try and pivot her in certain directions if need be. \n\nAnd at this point it's just me in the weeds so I kinda have to figure out something. My family was my lifeline and I screwed that up. :'3\n\nAnd please. Please don't tell me it's hopeless now that I'm back. I know I fucked up but I know it's not hopeless now too.

My 4-year-old brother has, on multiple occasions now, said that he's dead\/wants to die whenever he is reprimanded by our parents or otherwise feeling upset.\n\nFor some context, our father is pretty much incompetent as a parent (sleeps away most of the day, manipulative, possible narcissism, borderline emotionally abusive) and as a result our mom is at the end of her rope. So given the situation, I worry this is more than just a toddler not knowing how to express his feelings, but rather an early sign of emotional trauma.\n\nToday was a typical example of this. When my brother came home from school, he got yelled at by our father for being fussy. He then broke down into tears, curled up on the floor, and whispered \"I'm dead. I don't want to live anymore\". Our father, instead of consoling him\/digging deeper into the issue, simply told him to not talk like that. I then asked my brother to stand up and take off his jacket, but he kept repeating that he's dead and so he can't move. He's now asleep on the floor right in front of our door.\n\nI don't know what to make of this or what to do. It absolutely crushes me. When my brother is feeling alright he can be very active and curious, but when upset it's not uncommon for him to threaten things or otherwise be extremely unreasonable (which is likely also due to our father's behavior).

To this day she insists she loves me but has abused me all my life. A lot of the every day abuse involved manipulation and control, like going through my room while I was in school and confiscating things she didn\u2019t approve of or arguing with me about how I slept too much, going as far as dumping cold water on me to wake me up on the weekends. She regularly did this, was constantly putting me down and just being plain cruel. It could get physical and neglectful at times, but for the most part it was a barrage of emotional and psychological pain. During one argument she began hitting me with a desk lamp and when I curled my legs up to my chest to protect myself she fell to the floor and begged me not to hurt her, then threatened to call the police on me. She\u2019d speak badly of me to anyone who\u2019d listen and would then turn around to tell me how much aunt so and so or family friend such and such hated me because I am bad\/misbehaved\/ungrateful\/whatever. At worst she has threatened my life on two occasions when I was a teenager. I wondered why she hated me and was jealous when I found out other families were not like this. I could go on\u2026 her family in general is violent and dysfunctional, which is why I stay away from them now.\n\nMy dad on the other hand is a deadbeat and has never been around save for short phone calls.

I consider myself like an emotional orphan since I pretty much grew up alone.\n\nWhen I was 18 I received a scholarship to a top school in a field I was good at just to move as far away as possible. And after many years of a lot of therapy, medication, self-help, drugs, exercise, practice, etc I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I don\u2019t feel like dying all of the time. I\u2019ve been suicidal most of my life, but I can finally see a life for myself worth living for. But some days are very hard. I struggle to keep jobs for long as my CPTSD and depression can be overwhelming and I need a lot of time to recover. I worry about my ability to maintain a job and sustain myself to the point I\u2019ve considered applying for disability (I see now how naive that was considering the hurdles that entails.)\n\nI currently live with an ex boyfriend and his family. He was at one point abusive to me but that is another story. His family and I have a good relationship and they allow me to stay, and I have no intention of being with him again. Overall I\u2019m grateful to have a place to call home, but it\u2019s not great. It is very cramped, there are no windows, and the roof leaks. There is mold in some areas and I share a room with said ex. I get headaches if I stay in my room for too long so I\u2019m often out of the house. I can\u2019t afford to move out even though I start a position in a promising new career next week. I\u2019ll be making ok money but still wont be able to afford my own studio where I live. I\u2019ve considered living in my car but the instability of being homeless scares me so I stay. Most of all I struggle to see myself managing a full time job when I can\u2019t even really recover at home.\n\nI\u2019m turning 28 this year, and all I want in my life is some space where I can breathe, look out a window and see sunlight, where I can stretch my legs and not bump into something or someone, and where I can just be at peace. A pet to keep me company would be nice. I don\u2019t think that is a lot to ask but the people in my life say that I\u2019m asking for too much and the reality is that it\u2019s been so challenging to achieve. It could be worse, but I\u2019m very unhappy with life more often than not. I dont have a lot of close friends or family to talk to and maintaining relationships has been a struggle all my life.\n\nI woke up from a trauma related nightmare today to a leaky roof. This time I felt compelled to just shout into the void, thinking maybe I\u2019ll feel better since that wanting to not be alive feeling has been coming back.

In therapy we talked about the argument. He apologized for calling me a bitch. he claimed to not remember mocking my crying and laughed when I explained it to the therapist that he was acting like a toddler.   \n\n\nAt that point he said that I had wrote \"BITCH\" on his pillow in fabric paint. \n\nNot my finest moment. It was supposed to be dry by the time he went to bed. It got in his hair and he also laughed at that. The laughing just hurt. \n\nAnyways we played nice until the weekend. \n\nOne night he picked an argument with one of our boys over something dumb. I tried to quell it but doing that just escalated it. My son said something dumb and my husband rushed toward him yelling. I ran forward and grabbed my husband by the shoulders and tried pulling him back as he screamed in my sons face. As I was pulling back my husband pulled his head out and pushed me down. my body hit the side of a wooden dog kennel then the floor. I don't know if I lost consciousness. I remember my son yelling, asking why I fell like that. I heard him ask twice before I said I was pushed. I just responded, I didn't think of what I should have said.  \n\nThen I heard my 17 year old son start punching his father. I don't know how I knew, I just did. I got up and ran in between them. I yelled at my other son to call 911. That's what made my husband ( I am hating that term. lets say H. ) leave the house. Np one called 911, though I so wish we did now. \n\nThat night the boys and I watched a movie together before bed. The door was locked, we felt safe. The next morning, my jaw hurt so bad when I tried to move it. and I had what felt like a bruise right above my butt. \n\nI still didn't speak up to anyone.\n\nThe next morning my son brought me his Adderall that he takes daily. He showed me that there wasn't anything in the capsule. \n\nthat was the last straw. After the boys went to school I went to my PCM and told them everything. Structurally, I am fine, just bruises. I was assigned a victim advocate who helped me file a police report and helped my children and I get support and leave the house. \n\nI am saying all of this.... because it's the advice here that helped me realize where I was at. That it wasn't ok for H to laugh about him mocking me. That's when I started processing that I wasn't in a good relationship. I wasn't going to leave based on that, I was still making excuses\/reasons. But once I started added everything together, I can't believe how long I've been blind to the manipulation\/abuse. \n\nI always see \"oh everyone just says to leave\". Yes, A lot of people said to leave, but they gave valid reasons. Reasons I kept with me and recalled later. So thank you internet parents. I really didn't have anyone else to bring this up to.

My mom, although a sincerely loving mother, tries too hard to steer me in a direction that she deems fit for me, and hasn't always considered how I might feel about it. I witnessed a lot of heated arguments between my parents while growing up, and I've become very conflict-averse and am afraid to speak my mind, so that clearly doesn't help the situation. My family has never been one to express their true feelings & have vulnerable, heartfelt conversations, so I've never felt comfortable bringing up how I feel. I suppose thats why I've resorted to reddit.\n\n**Where I'm at:**\n\nI feel like I'm in the biggest rut of my life. I'm coming up on a year since graduating college. I don't have a job. Motivation is at an all time low. I'm not even trying hard to search for a job. I'm honestly nervous about getting a job because I feel so pathetic towards myself right now and I'm worried that I wouldn't be qualified enough for anything. I can tell my mom is getting annoyed that I'm not making any progress with my job search, and it's becoming embarrassing.  \n\nI have some really bad habits, which I'm utterly ashamed of but can't seem to shake (video games, adult films, mindless scrolling of social media). When I was much younger, it seems as if my mom was more concerned with being my friend than a parent, because there was no regulation around unproductive pastimes like gaming, or time spent on my phone. I know I can't blame her any longer, and that I need to adopt some responsibility and accountability for myself, but that hasn't happened. Recently, whenever I attempt to apply myself I end up getting really overwhelmed and frustrated, and I resort to my bad habits so I can distract myself from.\u00a0\n\nI feel like an adult who never fully grew up. On top of that, it feels like the worst case of cognitive dissonance I've ever experienced in my life. I know I have nasty habits. I know I need to find a job. I know I need to leave the house and take on some more adult responsibilities and become independent, but every day I wake up and I just repeat the same debilitating, emasculating, mind-numbing habits. I just... I don't know what to do. I feel so lost and oblivious to the steps I need to take to make some progress.  \n\n\nInternet parents... were any of you in similar, or even remotely similar positions?

I need you to bear with me as this story is a lot of cringe. I've been shopping at Whole Foods for 6 years at the same location (and occasionally others), I have been a paying customer for all of this time and have purchased a lot of items the majority of my shopping trips there. I also travel a bit out of my way to get there. I am struggling and I use a food stamp card most of the time, but sometimes use my debit, cash, or, more seldom, credit. I have never had any issues on the store's side, and when I first started going I genuinely felt refreshingly surprised that I didnt feel super judged or anything. I shop there because j have chronic pain and eating clean helps with that a lot, and I have always struggled with my weight and removing the temptation of junk food in the regular grocery stores helps a lot. I genuinely enjoy my time there and I have a genuine special interest in health foods now, though I do overeat, but I digress. I am autistic and struggle immensely with executive function. I usually don't keep as on top of what I'm putting in the cart proce wise as I should, because I just look for whatever I am looking for and then get what I can, and tell the cashier I decided against the rest. I definitely have had a few instances where I've troubled them asking to take stuff off, which I've always genuinely felt bad for and makes me nervous going in there, but it is still worth it to me health wise. Well, I have a boyfriend now and he is coming on grocery shopping trips with me. Today I went shopping thinking I had 300 on my link card, and then I remembered last minute that I was actually mistaken and wouldn't get this extra 280 until the 4th, and today I only had 108 on my card. Super inconvenient and I'm tired at this point, but overall no biggie I thought, these things happen, just gotta put stuff back. Since I had already spent hours and hours picking out the food, carefully reading the nutrition labels, I asked my boyfriend to just take the load off of me and decide which things we will get from the cart today, and which we will wait until the 4th for. I asked him to go put foods back and that I trusted his decision on which parts we'll get, I just wanted to be the one resting now since he was sitting down eating his sushi at the little dining area of the grocery store, he got to just chill out there while I shopped. So I thought it was fair that we now \"switched\", because teamwork. I did a hard task, now an error came up as they do for everyone sometimes, and I thought it would be a no-brainer that the boyfriend would reassure me and say hey it's okay I got it. He gets upset and is pouting around the store having an attitude and telling me to deal with it and that he doesn't want to go all around the store putting stuff back. I am embarrassed of his behavior but I realize we are both pretty immature and our parents failed us gravely. I think he also struggles with executive function a bit, but not as bad as I, or maybe we both do in different ways. So I ask my boyfriend to check out and choose what stuff we're getting and all that. Now, my boyfriend is the type to use self checkout which I've only been doing since we've been together, because my family just never did it growing up. I am actually really liking how much having self check out helps my executive function, because I get to organize the bags, take stuff off, put stuff on, and really exercise my options when I know I have a bit too much in my cart. So I have worried a lot about it looking suspicious that I would take a huge loaded cart to self check out, but figured that was a normal fear, that I'm doing the best I can for myself, and this was self care that I'm actually not going in a regular lane, since it's better for my exec function, and figured that every single person who uses these self check outs probably have the sameee fears, even if they're getting a normal amount of stuff. So okay, I push past it, I say it's all mental and I'm golden, and the fact that I have that little bit of paranoia means I have nothing to worry about. So, my boyfriend is flustered and tries to use the self check out that is supposed to be 15 items and under (and I admit I try to use it any which way and see if I can get away with it, since it helps me process what I'm getting so much. Sometimes it works, sometimes they will say no, I try to take it in stride when they say no, because I know it's not personal), he begins scanning the items while I now go over to where he was sitting at when he was eating his sushi, I of course left him with my food stamp\/link card and told him my pin number, and he then begins calling me back frustrated, asking me what I'm getting, I tell him again that I just wanted him to deal with it, that I had picked the food and was tired, and that he knows what I like so I trusted him to just choose which items we will be getting. He's moping all over the store and kinda whining, and we're trying to get each other to deal with it and he's kinda stomping around. This all gets a rise out of the one woman who was on duty to supervise self checkout today, and she starts getting incredibly impatient and hostile with us. I get it, it probably looks suspicious that we're doing all of this running around, and that you just heard me say I don't have enough money on me. I get why that would ring alarm bells, but the fact that this woman and I have seen each other plentiful times before and she knows I am a rightfully paying customer, even if a bit messy and dysfunctional, just made me appalled tbh. She started following us around the store, demanding over and over that we pick right now exactly what we're keeping and exactly what we're not. She grabbed another cart and told me over and over in a hurried way to start putting the stuff I don't want in her cart. I was just going to get the lowest costing thing of each item I had, so I needed to actually bring my cart around the store again to put the other items back so that I could compare prices, but I didn't want to say exactly that because I didn't want to be rude, I understand it can seem very distasteful to just say, \"I need to run back and check the tags because I want the cheapest\"- I know I am paying a premium to shop at a luxury store, that is a choice I made that I have settled on, and I understand there are class differences and just how crass it can be to outright say you want something, \"cheap\"-- so, I keep attempting to move my cart to the areas I've all shopped at, ex going to the chip isle to narrow my 4 bags of chips down to 1, and she keeps following me throughout the store. I get it, I must seem suspicious doing all this ranting and raving and bringing a full cart to self checkout, but she should know who I am by now, and I have been a paying customer for 6 years and have never tried any funny business, and they know that. However, the demeanor in her approach, while I understand her caution, is what made my jaw kinda drop. I was on the verge of tears and she was just talking AT me and not really trying to help me, I felt disrespected the same way a lot of people have disrespected and patronized me my whole life because they knew I wouldn't stand up for myself. I am meek, and just keep my head hanging low when someone is talking to me like a baby with no sense, just because I know that's how I act from being kinda awkward and being beat down my whole life. I am doing better at coping with anxiety today, but a few years ago this type of thing would have sent me into a full blown panic attack. I even debated today if what I had experienced was a mini panic attack, and I think it in fact was. I have had many people take advantage of me when I am panicking and am in, \"freeze\" mode, and it hurt that this would happen once again for the first major time in a while in the place I shop at regularly and know and trust and spend my time at, where I should be remembered on a first name basis tbh, but am not. That is how I felt today, I felt a bit like she took advantage of my vulnerability, because her tone and demeanor and sporadic approaching at \"helping\" (a.k.a. her listening to hear me, but NOT her listening to listen to me. Major difference) were just pretty nasty. I was so embarrassed and humiliated at this woman following me around the store like a thief and having this absolutely adjectives demeanor about her, this may seem kinda funny but she embarrassed me in front of the fish station, which was extra embarrassing to me because I used to shop that exact fish station A LOT and wanted to perhaps become friendly with the people there because I have considered applying for quite a while. The 3 men behind the fish counter looked at me with this look of absolute annoyance, and j just felt so humiliated and betrayed-- like, you guys KNOW I've purchased many, many, MANY salmons here a while ago, and I had a month of even being a pescatarian. In my opinion, one of the staff members should have called her out and said she's okay you know she shops here, she's just a bit ditzy and puts back items a lot. I am thinking of reporting her for her unprofessional behavior, because while there was a \"threat\", she handled the situation poorly, and with bad manners to a repeat customer, who, if anything, they should have cared MORE about helping me since they've seen me be a bit of a mess? Like, I don't disclose my autism much, but people can catch a vibe that someone kinda doesn't know how to life and may be on the spectrum or maybe even just a little slow and need extra help, and that's all the more patient you would want to be with them... I don't want to be Karen for no reason, but since I feel like my boundaries were pushed I feel like it would be a gross lack of self respect to not at least go to the customer service booth one of the next times I am in and just let them know my feelings about the situation and that I thought her behavior was very inappropriate. There is this one guy I always see there that has never given me any problems and I thought about going to him thr next time I see him stationed at customer service. I've never felt a warm welcome there, but I've never had any huge trouble either, just a feeling of coldness there, but whatever. I eat for myself and buy what groceries I think are good for me. I think my poorness shows on me not just with being thr token link card girl, but with me being only 5 foot for an adult, my demeanor, and in some of the way that I dress, though I am a little bit fancier lately as I've been shopping at clothes mentor (it's like a playto's closet for adults, designer thrift shop that is a little more picky about what they let in), so I always feel insecure about that when I am there. Still, I shouldn't be profiled unnecessarily unless I've shown that I give problems, but the only problems I've given have been the ones I've aforementioned, and that is within legal realm, even if annoying, and its not like I don't cringe at my OWN lack of function, it frustrates me too. Anyways, I am not sure how I should word my concern. I know it sounds petty but I kind of want her to get some kind of write up, because of how poorly she handled the situation, it just lacked a lot of people skills and listening skills and compassion, for a store that literally has certain values such as fair trade, integrity in the products they carry, etc. It really is a pompous atmosphere like the stereotype, but not AS bad as the stereotype. Which I find ironic from a store such as whole foods, but I am also not naive enough to be surprised. Anyways, how can I politely phrase my concern the next time I am there, and let them know that it made me really bad and that I didn't mean any harm. I also considered mentioning my autism, because they may get it then, it may click for them that I just lack executive function and am struggling a bit, but still a good and honest person. I only like to disclose my condition when the situation calls for it, though. I'm not sure I'd disclosing the autism would be a good idea though because I have long wanted to apply there and have been kinda too chicken, so if I do end up applying, which I know I will likely not get the job as I don't have executive function or math skills to save my life LOL, but if I did by chance get to interview (I actually saw they are doing interviews as of today), I know it is typically VERY ill-advised to let your manager know if you have autism, and for good reason, it is actually best NOT to disclose unless you really have to, and it is still advised not to, because you may think you need to when really it ends up hurting you. I feel like I would be very embarrassed to apply and interview there which is why I've put it off this long, but still, I have a genuine special interest in whole and natural goods and I feel like my knowledge and thirst for more knowledge could make me a great fit, and it would be kinda sad to not get in where I fit in. I know I kinda just went onto a second topic here, so I'll get off the interview topic since that is a side tangent. So back to this lady. After I had decided what I want to get and had only thr stuff I wanted to get in my cart, I asked my boyfriend to check out for me and asked him for the keys to his car and I went out there because I was already embarrassed, overwhelmed, and stressed, and wanted to get away from it all, and I shed a tear once I got in the car. He ended up calling me on my phone and saying there was still too much in the cart, and telling me to come in and downsize more, and I just kinda whined at him to figure it out himself, because I did not have the emotional capacity at this point, the situation had me near tears. I was hoping he would be more attuned to what I am going through, but he wasn't. I understood it was frusting for him to choose the groceries and put stuff back, but his making a scene about it and getting people on our backs made it even more frustrating for both of us, so on the way home we argued about how he should have just silently put away the excess groceries when I needed him to, instead of drawing a scene and making everything worse, because the groceries were going to need to be put back regardless, so sucking it up like anyone would would have been the way to go about it, and not making a target of ourselves, because the mission wouod still be the same, put back groceries. Anyways, after we got off the phone when I was in the car and he was checking out, he texted me saying that the woman told him that I should either come in or we should just leave, which absolutely pissed me off because while she had a hostile tone and approach with me, she didn't go as far as to say something specifically nasty to me, but she did when I was gone, to my boyfriend, which pissed me off because he is also like me and meek and I was so hurt that she would take advantage of being alone with my boyfriend and say things to him behind my back! I also DON'T like to be the type of person to drag race into things, but in this situation, I also wonder if maybe it was being my boyfriend is Asian, maybe it could have been a bit of racism in it that she would only go as far as to say something that explicitly basically stated that she didn't like us when I was away. I don't want to jump to any grand conclusions or make false allegations, I know there may have been absolutely NO racial bias behind it whatsoever, but it did strike me as odd that she was pissy at both him and I when we were in there together, but that the farthest she went saying things was, \"figure it out, I'll put it back, no stay here don't leave\" etc things of that nature, but went as far as basically telling us to get the f on only ONCE she was in front of my bf's face and not mine. I don't know, the whole situation was sketchy and I don't know how to end this paragraph, so I'll just leave it at this","upvote_ratio":0.18,"created_utc":1677297477.0},{"title":"I have mono, and I\u2019m lonely and scared","author":"the101stgec","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/11ahzrz\/i_have_mono_and_im_lonely_and_scared\/","text":"I tested positive for mono on Tuesday and the last three days have been horrible.

Been doing it since I was 17, so I'm familiar with ins and outs, no need for advice on this front. I'm also waiting to get assessed on possible personality disorder (I'm suspecting schizoid pd, but I'm not really qualified to make this assumption). Any opinions on that are welcome. And yes, I'm aware none of you can diagnose me, it's why I'm on the waiting list for an actual clinical psychologist.\n\nThis is mostly a rant, one that would usually go straight to my bff, but since he's in the middle of something and I can't decide if I want to hug him or kick his ass, this time Reddit will get a handful of crazy. Sorry.\n\nIt will also be long and random and confusing and all over the place. So just like me. Sorry again.\n\nAnd one other thing, this will include mention of self harm. DO NOT equate self harm with suicide. IT IS NOT THE SAME THING. I swear, if one more person says it's the same thing...BAM! Right in the kisser!\n\nSo, let the crazy begin!\n\nI'm all kinds of messed up right now. Just for quick (I hope) background, I got diagnosed with depression and general anxiety when I was 17 and finally lost my shit. Probably was depressed for at least a few years before that, but nobody's ever heard of mental problems where (and when) I lived, and especially not in a straight A quiet student from a stable home (I am sooo not opening THAT can of worms right now). The usual procedure was executed (school counselor, psychiatrist, meds, mental hospital... that's usual, right?) and my parents will go to their graves claiming there was nothing ever wrong in our house (I'm not even touching this can of worms). (I've got a lot of cans of worms. I don't like worms).\n\nSo yeah, clinical chronic depression for me it is. At least I managed to give my anxiety cold turkey (that's a phrase, right?). Also managed to not self harm for years. Until Sunday, that is (I tried once about two years ago, but there was not a sharp knife in the house, and then a friend came from the store and I had to stop because I was not in the mood for an intervention and also didn't want to ruin the vacation anymore that I already did). \n\nAnyhow, my personality is not the easiest to handle (even for me); there's the depression, occasional attention seeking, mood swings, jealousy, drama, pathetic-ness, bursts of rage (mostly toward myself, but no easier to handle for that), self isolation, bouts of resentment... My mood also greatly deepnds on my bff (too much to be healthy, working on it, but I could write a whole other post about THAT so I'll try not to go into too much detail here). Let's just say I've known him for more than 10 years, was in love with him at the beginning but now I know him a lot better than I did back then so I'm not in love with him anymore. Now I just love him. He's aware of that, we talked about it more than once (or twice). We are best friends (with benefits), which works great for both of us. He does love me too, in a way he is capable of (that is not an assumption or wishful thinking, he told me. Multiple times. With words.) But that is not enough for us to try anything more. What we have works, it gives us both what we want\/need and we are happy with the way things are. Also, our personalities are so similar (too similar) we'd just end up destroying what we have and it's just not worth it. Let's call this guy B, shall we? (If anybody's gonna go sticking their noses in there just be careful, I bite).\n\nWhere was I? Yeah, so, I've been having some tough months. I tend to swing between ''all the company'' and ''no company at all'' and I was in a no company phase. Some of it is because of winter, some because I get tired of people and need a break, some has to do with aforementioned resentment (this time it was because my friends make more money than me and because they tend to make plans without taking into consideration the fact that I need to find a pet sitter for a boxer and two cats before I can go anywhere and this things take time. And momey). So in the few months I was self isolating some thing happened I was not aware of. Like my friend N moving out and wanting a divorce from her husband (I talked about her in a post before). Now I know I was distant (and also had a minor freak out in December over a New Year vacation plans; I might have been a bit rude (short? Curt?) in our fb group, but as always B took the full hit (I often feel sorry for him for putting up with my shit)). \n\nAnywhore, nobody bothered to tell me. Not N, not B, not K (who is my brother from another mother and a different father). I mean, this is like, important, right? Something big happening with someone from our friend group? Maybe I'd be, you know, interested. But apparently this was on the need-to-know basis and I'm not on the list. Well fuck you. \n\nN called me a few weeks back, told me she moved out to a studio apartment K's familiar owns. She said her cat is still with her husband, that she got to the breaking point, that they are going to marriage counseling, that she hopes they can work it out but she's not moving back in the house with her FIL (he is a handful). She wants to fix this, she loves him, they both want this to work, they'll go to individual therapy.  Ok, good. I mean bad, but good. Then a week after that I asked B how N and husband are and he told me they are getting a divorce. I got all big eyed and naively asked ''wait, what about counseling? They were going to start marriage counseling...\" And he told me yeah, nah, there was nevere gonna be counseling, she was just not brave enough to tell her husband it's over so she used the first and only session to tell him she wants a divorce.   (They still both started individual therapy, so... I guess that's something). Well fuck you. (If you don't understand why read that again and\/or ask for clarification. I'll gladly spell it out because I'm still pissed).\n\nThen B wanted to lick my feet to which I gladly agreed. Then we talked random stuff for a bit but I was just getting angrier and angrier so I went home. Then I sent him a text saying I'm either having a really bad episode or I'm starting to hate all of them. Then I was quite for a day. Then I started sending explanations and clarifications in a series of texts of varying degrees of desperation and was just generally making a fool out of myself. He wisely never replied, but that only made me more angry. Then this Friday I went to their band practice. (N's husband is also a part of this band but is currently unavailable. He is also in our friend group and he's a good guy). B drunkenly told me he's not angry with me, which is good. \n\nSaturday I spent cleaning and being in a good mood and trying to set up meeting with B on Sunday about something very much not legal, but he told me he wasn't sure when he's gonna be home cause he's going to \"City\". Cool, he's got friends there. Then he told me he's visiting N. I forgot she now temporarily lives in \"City\", that's where the studio apartment is. Then I started thinking, he's going there on Saturday and he's not sure when he's gonna be home Sunday, where tf is he going to sleep (no, this is not going where we're all thinking right now). So, because I'm me, I started getting into a bad mood. But I'm saying to myself to stop being jealous and selfish and unreasonable, she's in a bad place and she needs friends, no need to go all batshit crazy over nothing (logically I know that, there is not a chance in heaven or hell anything will ever happen between them, I can explain the logic behind this later if needed). \n\nThen it was Sunday. In the afternoon I texted B if he's got an idea of when he's coming home, he said no. Ok cool, no problem. I texed him random suff over the course of day, he would randomly reply or not (which is normal, I often text him just random shit that pops into my mind and I don't expect a reply unless it's a direct question, the world does not revolve around me). After few hours (4 or 5 I think) I asked again if he's gonna be home soon (I go to bed early because I need to get up between 3.30-4am for work) and he said he hasn't decided yet and I lost my shit. Zero to 100 in a time it takes to read 7 words. I got really bad. I asked what the fuck is so special at N's place and he told me they are being lazy and watching series. So I got worse and asked why he even bothered to visit her. Isn't T (female, N bff since forever and also part of our group and a great person) enough for her or is she just not talking to me? And to stop by when he gets his ass back home. No reply (smart guy). \n\nI need to mention I also called K once during the day (before I lost it) to ask about him taking a look at my car, but he didn't pick up. I assumed he's either sleeping off a hangover or doing something around the house, no big deal, he'll call when he has time. He did. Yup, you guessed it. He was also at N's. Well fuck you\n\nI was beyond pissed. B not once mentioned they are all there. Nobody told me they are going. Nobody invited me. I was so hurt. In my head it means either nobody thought to invite me or one of them specifically said not to invite me. I don't know what's worse. At least I didn't lose it at K.\n\nThat was the worst I've been in a long long time. Both in a sense of how I felt and how I acted. I was watching Zombieland and then Hellboy and crying. Was trying to do diamond painting to distract myself. It didn't work. I was just going in circles of blaming myself, blaming them, hating myself, hating them over and over and over and over.... That's a part of me I really don't like and usually manage to keep under control. Well that Sunday I failed. And I cut myself. I'm not sorry. It helped.\n\nMonday I told my therapist what happened (shorter version, I was at work, it was phone session, and I really didn't want to cry where someone can see me). She changed my meds, now we'll try to regulate my dopamine instead of serotonin. I hope it works. God, do I hope it works. \n\nI also texted B to apologize and to say I'm on different meds and I might soon get normal again (because I wouldn't be me if I kept my mouth shut). He didn't reply and I don't blame him. He's got a bunch of his own issues, some of it because N's husband partially blames him for divorce (yeah, right. I wanna hit him. With a chair.) K looked at my car and he has to order a part to fix it. There is something wrong with him too, but he said he'll tell me when he sorts his shit out. Fair enough. I don't know how N is doing and I'm not sure I care anymore. \n\nSome days I just don't care. I can't. I'm sick of caring. I wish I was a socipath and only cared about myself. Sometimes I'm just so done with people and emotions and love and friendships. (I'm not suicidal, if someone's worried). I'm just tired.\n\nI'm also 5minutes away from having to get up and get ready for work. Guess who's gonna buy a six pack of redbull on the way...\n\nThere's probably a bunch of stuff I forgot to mention or don't have time to mention. Please feel free to ask whatever (see how I think people care about me?) And I'll probably answer in about 12-13 hours when I come home from work, because I like talking about myself (totally not self centered tho \/s). \n\nWell, see ya and thank you to those who got to the end. Fingers crossed I don't fall asleep at work!\n\nETA because I'm not done yet: I know my friends have their own lives and problems and cannot wait on standby for when I decide I want some attention and I want it right now, god dammit! I know I'm not the center of their universe (or any universe for that matter, because there isn't one, as far as we know). And I know I'm selfish for wanting some attention right now when so much is happening. But just once in a while I'd like for someone to knock on my door for no other reason than to spend time with me just for the sake of it. To just sit on the couch, drink coffee and comment on a stupid show or something. Be there watching tv or playing games while I do my diamond painting and just throw random comment out once in a while. Or just be on skype or zoom call just to be connected and have company without actually having a company (my favourite kind). And maybe tell me they love me.

It's been a year since I'd gone to the dentist. What's funny is that I spent about 10 years not going to the dentist, then I started going more regularly (once every 1-2 years). Last year I went to the dentist and started being more careful with my teeth. I used more dental floss and an interdental brush more than I'd ever used in my life. Unfortunately, I suck at using the dental floss because it is very difficult to do so. So I pick some parts with the interdental toothbrush, but don't use the floss as much. \n\nI'm not kidding, I've used both the dental floss and the interdental brush more than I'd ever had in my whole life during the last year.\n\nYet, I get to the dentist today... and I have a cavity. A small cavity between crevices on a front tooth. A front. tooth.\n\nI don't even know what to say. I'm upset and I'm scared. I don't want to have a filling on my front tooth. And I also don't want to have a cavity there. The dentist said to pay attention to it and go there if it grew. And she said to use dental floss and clean my teeth very well. I asked if that would reverse the cavity and she said no but it would prevent it from growing.\n\nI guess I'm here for a bunch of thoughts and I'd like your thoughts on them.\n\n1. Have you ever had a cavity in your front teeth? How does the filling look like?\n\n2. Have you ever had a small cavity that you didn't get a filling for? For how long have you had it and did you treat it well for all this time and it didn't grow at all?\n\n3. How do you use dental floss? Or rather, what do you use instead of dental floss? Because I have so much trouble using it. Especially for the back teeth. but even in the front teeth. I need to do strenght for it to go in between the teeth, then it hurts my gum, then I need to wipe down, and it slips from the teeth, it slips from my fingers. For the back teeth I need to open my mouth so much and I just drool, and it keeps slipping so much. I can't really use it on my wisdom teeth - they're so far back, there's no way to manage dental floss. And since my teeth are also a bit crooked now, it's even harder (I imagine)\n\n4. I know you're not doctors, but maybe you are. Has anyone had a caries that reversed? Maybe the doctor didn't know and that is possible? Maybe there's a way to treat a caries that will make it reverse before it becomes bigger? I mean, I don't want to just wait for it to grow - I can imagine that then, the filling would need to be much bigger?\n\n5. I hate my teeth. I've had 2 caries and 2 fillings on molars growing up, and now I have a third. I have all 4 wisdom tetth which cause me pain and I have TMJ dysfunction. I used braces, got them all nice and pretty, but years later they're crooked again (the bottom teeth), which also make it harder to clean them. Yet my brother has perfect teeth. All he needed his whole life were braces. No wisdom teeth (he had an x-ray). No cavities. And he hasn't even gone to the dentist for 15 years (more than I) before he did go this year and everything was fine. It's not fair that he got all the good genes.\n\n6. I feel ugly, even if the cavity is so small yet, now I can see it if I look for it in the mirror, and I hate it.\n\n7. Since I'm supposed to avoid it from growing more and worsen, I'm just scared of eating food right now. I treated my teeth better than I've ever done during the last year. I've even bought a new toothpaste and a mouth washer and I've been using those since January. Of course I'll have to eat, but now i'm just thinking that my smoothies have sugar (because of the fruits), etc, everything I eat is dangerous, because I have a cavity there, waiting to grow, let's not kid ourselves, it WILL grow, sooner or later, and then it'll be my fault, for eating, for not cleaning my teeth well enough, etc. So right now i'm hungry but I'm scared of eating to be honest.\n\nthat's about it, I guess.\n\nthanks for listening.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677085903.0},{"title":"How to stop feeling so guilty for leaving a job?","author":"throwawayeffigy420","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/119b2kd\/how_to_stop_feeling_so_guilty_for_leaving_a_job\/","text":"So I work at a small business, and for a little bit now Ive been considering leaving.

My mom abuses alcohol and drugs, while my dad is a PTSD vet. I grew up below the poverty line, lived in a shelter for a bit, house to house with different family members, but I finally moved out when I was 18 in 2020, and felt free. Was extremely happy, and had the best year of my life. I then had a really bad roommate situation and had to move back in with my mom as I had no where else to turn (other than no home). After some time it got unbearable once again, as my mom and I would get into fights all the time, and there would be dog feces and urine everywhere as she wouldn't take the dogs out when I was at work. But anyway fast forward now, I live with my dad now as he moved into town due to his father passing away. It isn't great, my little brother and I get into fights all the time with him, but honestly, I'm just glad I have a home to stay at at the moment.  \n\n\nThe reason why I'm reaching out for help is because I'm sitting in my room right now, and I feel very alone right now, and would just like some help. I know people recommend therapy and everything, but I'm not sure if that's my \"solution\". I know it would help, and I eventually plan on getting an appointment scheduled, but honestly, it just sucks not feeling like I have someone to really depend on\/look up to. Every role model I ever had eventually did, or I found out had done horrible things. The last real role model I had was my music teacher in high school, but he ended up having sex with one of my friends, and it really broke my trust.   \n\n\nHonestly typing all of this out right now just feels very surreal, but I just would like some guidance I guess? I'm not really sure what it is I need, but I just want something, any help at all I guess. In school, I at least would have teachers that would say they were proud of me and it would make me very ecstatic, and when I was in a relationship, it was the happiest I had ever been, but now after highschool at the age of 20, and not really getting that support, I don't even know where to possibly get that from. I could get into a relationship again, but I know I have a lot of baggage and I don't want to get into a relationship just for the support. It wouldn't actually fix the root problem, and I feel like that would just be taking advantage of someone for emotional support. Idk, maybe I'm overthinking it, but I just feel like my whole life has been a full grind with no real reward. Arguably, my point in my life right now is the best version of myself I've ever been, but without anyone to say \"I'm proud of you\" it just sucks. I can be positive a lot of the time, especially when I'm going to the gym, or hanging with friends. But at random times, memories of my life will pop up, or the realizations that I don't really have anyone to \"lean on\" will hit me like a boulder and just make me cry.  \n\n\nSorry for the vent, I'm really not trying to sound like I'm seeking attention or sympathy, I just really really wish I had a parent rn :(","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677044901.0},{"title":"I (16f) have been struggling to go into adult hood.","author":"hurtmelikeithurtsyou","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/118gm45\/i_16f_have_been_struggling_to_go_into_adult_hood\/","text":"I\u2019m 16 and still don\u2019t have a license, haven\u2019t started the program to, no ID (so I can\u2019t get a job) and I feel awful.

I asked my mom if she can take me to get my ID and have the papers ready and she always says she will later and never does. I really want a job like all of my other friends. I have no ride since I can\u2019t drive and I\u2019m so stressed about this job situation. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get one until I\u2019m 18 which doesn\u2019t fit my plan of moving out once I graduate (I\u2019ll be 17 when I graduate).

We are both married and our spouses have all hung out together. We see each other occasionally, maybe 3-4 times a year. He has a co-dependent relationship with me, often treating me like a family member instead of a friend. For example, he got upset when I didn't go to his mother's funeral to support him and often gives me very extensive advice when I haven't asked for it. He also will call me and complain about issues he has with his wife. He also often offers to help me with things but they never really make sense and if I accepted his help, it would be more trouble than just doing things myself. \n\nLast week, he called me after not having spoken for about 3-4 months. He made some small talk but seemed eager to get to a point where he could ask me to lend his friend \"D\" (60+,M) $40k. Apparently his friend's accountant made off with $100k and now he no longer has enough money to pay his vendors and keep his business going. My friend and his friend both live far more extravagantly than me, living in bigger houses in more expensive neighborhoods, have multiple cars (like 5+ cars) and in general live paycheck to paycheck. My husband and I live VERY frugally, spending only about 20% of our paychecks, and are trying to save up for an early retirement. My husband also often gets sick and I take care of my mother who is handicapped. I like to have a big emergency fund in case they both get worse and I have to quit my job to take care of both of them. I also recently won a large settlement against my hospital. (I am now healthy and mostly recovered, but still have lingering emotional and psychological issues). \n\nWhen my friend asked me to lend his friend $40k, I was really hesitant, but I wanted to help him out. I made several suggestions on where he could get money instead but for one reason or another they all won't work. I wondered why S. didn't want to ask his family members for help, because they are all multimillionaires and he even has a billionaire in his family. I don't know why I didn't ask, I think I thought it was an invasion of his privacy. Eventually I caved agreed to lend the money if we all signed and notarized a loan agreement. \n\nThe next day, we all drove to the notary to get the loan agreement signed. While at the notary, D. kept telling me about how all of his really big clients and how they provide a steady source of income for him. It sounded like he could easily make hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not a million dollars a year. He also talked about many of his very rich friends and how he has known them a long time. \n\nAfter the loan agreement was signed, both S. and D. kept pushing me to wire the money right away. I kept telling them I needed to finish out my work day as I had taken time away from work to go to the notary. After awhile, I started feeling really uncomfortable and finally texted them explaining that I was not comfortable lending money and that I was saving it in case my family needed it. I received no response, though they did stop rushing me to wire the money.\n\nIt's been about three days and I still can't shake the feeling that they were trying to take advantage of me. I still feel really uncomfortable. I also wonder if S. was ever my friend to begin with. \n\nAny thoughts, advice, similar stories?","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676927641.0},{"title":"advice on bfs parents wanting to provide an apartment for us?","author":"alternativeusertoday","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/118bhfc\/advice_on_bfs_parents_wanting_to_provide_an\/","text":"i\u2019m 18f and my boyfriend is 19m, we\u2019ve been together since sophomore year in high school. throughout our relationship his family was the same as mine: middle class\/lower middle class. his father just started making a significantly more amount, to the point they\u2019re moving out of the suburbs and getting a pool! they will be building their dream house in 1-2 years. me and my bf are currently in college in said-suburbs (i live with my mom, and two brothers) and this house is 35-45 minutes away from our campuses. because of this, and his fathers new income, they have explained to the both of us that they\u2019re in a financial position where they can lease us an apartment under their name and are wanting to provide for us like this because they have the spare money. \n\nthis scares the shit out of me because my mom is very strict and said if i ever wanted to move out i needed to \u201chave double rent, a stable income\u201d and she has to \u201capprove my roommate\u201d if getting one. this option i literally don\u2019t contribute anything besides id cover any expenses for my cat and id but my own soap and toiletries just because i want to. they have offered to cover literally everything else including helping buy us supplies and groceries when needed. i have no idea how to even explain this to my mom and have her be understanding. i\u2019ll say myself, from her raising me, i think i\u2019m taking advantage of them and maybe this will end badly. but i am aware that a parent can lease and co-sign, and there\u2019s things in place that they are legally required to pay if we can\u2019t. but something about this scares me and i\u2019m scared to tell my mom.\n\ni have 4 older siblings, 3 of which have moved out because of college (out of house living) and 1 that still lives with us. i don\u2019t have any siblings to look up to for a pattern on what will happen, or how this even works, when moving out with my boyfriend. i also use a family car, so no more car? and i pick up my little brother from school, so will i look like a dick just leaving him? i feel responsible. he can ride the bus, tho, been trying to make him since i started college but he refuses because \u201che\u2019s scared.\u201d\n\ni guess i\u2019m posting looking for advice on:\n\nhow to break this to my mom? \n\nwhat can i do to reassure her this will be okay?\n\nwhat can i do to reassure myself this will be okay?\n\nwhat can go wrong?\n\nhow to move out at 18?\n\nedit: more info i thought was important. i don\u2019t have a job, i was let off a seasonal job about a month ago and made the decision to not go back to work because i am in the medical field and this semester is a lot of studying and important learning so i\u2019m dedicating all my time towards this term. my boyfriend also doesn\u2019t have a job but he works for his dad and his dads boss (his dad does plumbling\/construction\/hard labor) and he can make easy money from this. he has also guaranteed a remote job in the apartment for this summer, he used to make $600 a week. i also receive money from my rich absent daddy weekly: $50 which i\u2019ve used towards gas since losing my job.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677001997.0},{"title":"Lost and questioning my relationship with my BF.

We've been together for over a year, we work at the same place (no power imbalance), we live together and have three dogs. \n\nThings were going really well at first, we just clicked and he made me feel so safe. My previous relationship was abusive and he would hold me through the flashbacks. He has never once made me feel pressured to do things I don't want to. We agree on every major stance. He told me he loved the way I spoke up for myself and how stubborn I was. His easygoing, social personality matched up so well with my quiet, sometimes divisive one. I could honestly go on and on about the things I love about him. I really think he's someone I could spend my life with.\n\nWe had to go long distance for 6 months, and it actually worked out really well. In a way, it kind of made me confront my insecurities from being cheated on. We wanted to rent from the same person when he came back and ended up just moving in together. It's a really nice place, a house and a backyard in a nice neighborhood, with affordable rent (very rare). \n\nEvery since we moved in though, we've been fighting pretty much constantly. It's hell. He'll let hurt feelings sit for days without mentioning anything, until I finally bring it up because I can't stand it. I do 95% of the housework, and he contributes more financially, but not as much as I work in at home. He's gotten better but it's like pulling teeth. Part of it is I have different standards, but I've tried not caring as much and it doesn't work. His dog is reactive and too big for me to handle, and he'll buy medicine but doesn't train him enough or put him on the lead outside even though he snaps at neighbors. It's making my dogs' behavior worse. He's defensive a lot of the time, and I admit I come at him hard sometimes but I don't think I am defensive like that unless I truly believe I am right and nothing can change my mind. He doesn't seem to believe me when I have a problem until he literally sees an example staring him in the face. I worked nights and he caused me to have the worst migraine of my life and call in sick for two days by letting the dogs bang around the house. The worst fight of our relationship, he ignored me when I was sobbing to play online and then go out with his friends. And he ignored me when I was crying again last night in bed. He doesn't take me out on dates anymore or give me the physical and emotional intimacy I need. I pretty much have to beg him to spend time with me when I can (he's asked me, but I wasn't able). I don't even know who I am anymore because I'm constantly cleaning and just feeling overwhelmed in my free time. I fix things around the house that he hasn't even noticed were problems. I took apart a table to move to a different room on my off day bc we don't have a dinner table yet, set it up so nicely, and he moved it across the room the same night just because he wasn't close enough to the plug on the wall. He \"forgot\" (I don't believe him) about valentines day until we made up after a fight a couple days earlier, and I got presents late, even though I had presents ready for him despite the fighting. I bring him home random stuff that made me think about him, but he doesn't do the same. And to top it all off, he's followed some softcore porn accounts on social media, which I told him very early on was unacceptable. I guess I checked because I wanted more reasons to be sad? \n\nIdk. This could turn into a novel. I just don't trust him fully anymore and I'm so emotionally raw that every small thing that happens just takes me right back. I'm happy when I'm distracted but when I get home I'm just so sad and almost empty. I don't feel like he cares about me like a life partner should. He keeps talking about our future but I'm having trouble imagining it now because I don't want this to be my future (especially with kids). I can't ignore it and be normal. I don't think he's cheated on me, but I'm going to ask him anyway bc of the porn accounts even though I know he will be hurt, becuase if I don't I'll always wonder.\n\nBelieve me when I say he's seriously amazing. You don't see all of the good parts on reddit, and naturally I'm sad so I'm going to talk about that more. Please don't talk shit because I do still love him. Idk what to do though. I need this place for my dogs, and we work together. We work such an odd schedule that there's no interaction at all with anyone outside of our workplace. As much pain as I'm in right now, it causes me more pain to imagine myself without him or going through a breakup when we're this intertwined. I know he's dealing with undiagnosed mental issues and he's currently being evaluated. I know exactly how it is, but I can't excuse it.\n\nWhat do I do? Individual therapy is covered by my job but couples' therapy isn't, and neither of us have the money for that honestly. I really don't want to break up with him. I still think we're honestly a really good match but I'm a fixer and I don't know how to fix this.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677035425.0},{"title":"My partner and I bicker like Bert and Ernie","author":"unoriginaloser","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/118gh02\/my_partner_and_i_bicker_like_bert_and_ernie\/","text":"is this healthy? i mean, to a tee, Bert and Ernie share the same dynamic as my boyfriend and I. i\u2019m Ernie, he\u2019s Bert.\n\nwe\u2019ve been together 3 years and still very much love each other, i\u2019ve just been wondering! i\u2019m 22, he\u2019s 27, and we have lived together through basically the entire relationship.

I loved the job but a series of changes and a traspher to new location affected my mental health along with some personal issues at home that shook the family and we are still navigating the fallout of while the main issues are under control now it's had rippling effects on my household and some relationships are heavily damaged.  \n\n\nI have had several job offers and it's been nice to be able to reject a few. I'm now trying to decide between two but they have both offered outside of what I originally applied for adding a bit of confusion. \n\n\nJob A: the interview went well and I liked both people that interviewed me. \nI applied for a team leader role and have been offered a lower role as a team member. The pay is still pretty good and I've been offered a slightly larger 24h contract over a 16h that would normally be offered for this position with a comment of \"I started in this role just over a year ago and look at me now\" from the new manager opening the location.\nThis is a new build so I would be part of the opening team and its walking distance. I have worked in this area before in a community centered business meaning I know lots of locals and they  know me and my family members. Hours would be midday to late  but could be between 6am-10pm.  Heavy lifting could compromise an old injury. I also have a connection \"N\" from the previous job in the local community. N knows something happened at the end of last year and was starting to press for information after my interview (I spoke to N in a second location that they currently have a team member role)  I don't want to talk about the issue it's had massive effects on my family and our relationships. N has got  the team leader role and would be one of my superiors at work....they are also a known gossip and part of several local groups.\n\n\nJob B: the Interview went really well I applied for a colleague role and have been offered a supervisor role. I was able to be a bit more honest about my choice to give up my last job, discussing some of the stresses of my previous supervisor role and wanting to stop being a \"yes\" person and that I am in a personal growth place this year and putting myself first...or even on the list of my priorities. I Connected with the manager at Job B like my previous manger but she feels a little more experienced and potentially better at guiding though tough situations. I would need to use public transport for around 30mins like before the transpher at my last job. I need to check pay I doubt it will be as high as job A's hourly rate.  Lots of learning optunity and a chance to build my own systems, more hours and higher targets and teach the team some new equipment I have some experience with. Potently better bonuses and discounts. Lighter lifting duties. More 9-5 hours but may need to check alarms out of hours. \n\n\nI have another interview lined up for later this week however I don't think hours will suit me and my transport situation but as it's a trainee manger role I'd like the experience and to find out more about the role, a forth job that was top of my list I'm still waiting to hear back from but not holding my breath. \nThe jobs were meant to be a fill gap as husband and I are planning on moving but the effects of the family issue has slowed this down and we have decided to stay and offer a family member support for the time being and to get a bit more financial security under us while reducing some financial stress on the family member....however I have been told we can just go but I don't think said family member has not fully processed what's happened and I don't want to leave them vulnerable. \n\nAny advice moving forward would be appreciated. \n\nThank you for reading and sorry if my dyslexia has made it difficult to get through.\nEdited some spelling mistakes.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676968225.0},{"title":"Cry for help, I need away from NFamily","author":"iamspencerhastings","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/117uj0b\/cry_for_help_i_need_away_from_nfamily\/","text":"So.

But above all, he is very controlling and needs everything to go his way because nothing else is right. I don't want kids because I am scared of becoming anywhere close to the type of parent he was\/is.\n\nI like to think that I was a good kid. Got very good grades, did extra curriculars when I was allowed, got scholarships, and didn't \"act out\". But he always assumes the worst from me and doesn't believe or trust in me. \n\nI have wanted to move out since I was young but never seem to have the means and I recognize that a lot of people my age are already living on their own. I am a recent grad and am newly employed but do not have a lot of savings nor do I have job stability which makes me hesitant to make the move out. I also have a very good relationship with my mother and sibling which makes me not want to leave home. In terms of alternative living arrangements, the only family that I'd feel comfortable asking to stay with doesn't have a lot of spare room and literally lives down the street which makes it feel too close.\n\nTherapy has helped me cope and I am better at controlling my own emotions around it but its exhausting and its more just being better at tolerating it since the problem isn't going to go away. \n\nIdk what to do and feel very stuck. \n\n\n\nTLDR: i have a good relationship with my family except my toxic father who makes it difficult to live in the same house. I'd like to move out but am broke with no job security.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676964819.0},{"title":"Options of owning a vehicle in the U.S.","author":"SpankoTheCow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/117mqfp\/options_of_owning_a_vehicle_in_the_us\/","text":"Hello all!\n\n# Context:\nI am about to graduate from university and have a pretty nifty job lined up for me.

I witnessed my parents cheat in person, hearing it from other rooms, and my mom would constantly complain to me about my dads cheating and his behavior at a young age. I've always had issues learning but since i was young as long as i pushed myself extremely hard i would be able to succeed, which ive rarely done to be able to avoid failure. but in adulthood ive only recently learned extremely important things. I've only recently learned all the names of months and their order, i didnt even know how to multiply by the end of my 4th grade school semester, days of the year.\n\nNow to add on to the next piece of important information, when i found out what computers were and started playing roblox i used it as an escape from what id assume was an extremely early depression? or maybe i didnt understand it all because i was young, but knew about things like sex, violence etc but i digress, I would play roblox a lot and be on and off with it, or i would play with legos a lot. Eventually my family would move to a different state with my grandparents. I started playing roblox again and another game Free Realms. my grandparents gave me more freedoms for the computer than my parents, and this led to unbroken cycles of addiction, my grandparents would yell at my mom for trying to get me off of it to the point where she would have to sneak behind the couch. I'm realizing that i was in such a toxic environment i only had two choices; to let me grandparents feed my addiction, indirectly making me socially inept or be around by abusive parents and a dad that constantly calls my mom a fatass, cow, bitch when she's fit. I would play roblox hours a day without eating a lot of days, i would be hunched over playing for hours and getting egirlfriends it was extremely cringe, but this is where it all starts, i was obsessed with this roblox girlfriend i had and when my grandpas computer fried i was terrified of losing her and i would use my mom to text her via the game. I went as far as to playing on my parents ipad with her, glued to it like a zombie, no breaks although it was harder to get away with playing on the ipad all day because it was my dads, I'd send messages every day hoping she wouldnt leave me. When she did i got very depressed every time, the thing is i was blowing my friends off constantly for this person i didnt even know and was extremely malnourished, barely eating and drinking tons of diet coke every day. After this i would have on and off obsessions throughout my years with the game. every time the same, no eating, etc. when we moved out my grandparents, i lost the only ones protecting me. I can't stop crying as i type this, as i believe it was my worst years and the downhill.\n\nIn my middle school years, my\n\nparents were ruthless, my parents shaped my bad behavior and would abuse me when i acted out. Here's a list of things i experienced:\n\n\\- My mom would punch me in the face and yell shut the fuck up for arguing with her multiple times,\n\n\\- My dad would beat mom, mom would hide behind me, i would watch my dad beat my mom , kick her down the stairs,  throw things at her, one time he threw all her clothes in a dumpster and she had none left\n\n\\- mom would take anger on me and everytime i wanted her to stop babying me she'd abuse me as a reaction. One time i wanted her to stop giving me showers at 13, so i locked myself in my bathroom, and after i got out the shower and left the bathroom she punched me in the face and said i didnt clean myself right so my dad came home and asked what was happening and when i told him he attacked my mom for babying me, this was the unpredictable state of my childhood\n\n\\- parents didnt understand discipline from abuse, when you spank a child or hit him with the belt, it should be out of the principle of making them fear the \"idea\" of getting hit by it, and lightly hit them. my parents straight up abused me, my mom would use an iron plug to whip at me for 30 minutes straight i screamed so long and so loud i could barely talk, one time she started whipping at my face and my eye was bleeding around the pupil and i had to tell everyone at school it was a baseball accident. My mom would punch me in the face when she got really mad and belitted me calling me a piece of shit like my dad, an asshole, the most awful son ever, and that she gets me everything she wants and all she asks for is for me to listen, then would act like she loves me and didn't just beat the shit out of me. My mom would make me hide in her car trunk so she could fake me to a race track as well, would also make me hide in her trunk while she cheated with my dad at a hotel while i was 18. My mom always gossips about how ugly people are to me and other crap 24\/7 as well.\n\n\\- dad literally assaulted me one time and just started punching the shit out of me, you know how Drax gets eaten by that monster in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and he starts stabbing at it like crazy? that was basically my dad for 10 minutes- after he choked me out and threw me to the ground as my mom watched with a face of contempt for me, as if she enjoyed watching me get my turn at the beatings.\n\n\\- parents would always pick on my appearance, skinny stature and shave my head, i had extremely low self esteem and was depressed\n\n\\- always got yelled at and abused for not doing good in school even though my parents would keep me up all night fighting each other and yelling\n\n\\- i used money to buy a pink jacket once and my mom ridiculed me and kept accusing me of being gay and yelled at me, until i returned it.\n\n\\- she hid money in a book of mine once and when she asked me where the book was and i said i dont know (i didnt remember) then she started throwing stuff at me, hitting me, smashing my legos, then i was able to remember\n\n\\- stole my TV that i paid for because i had bad grades\n\nEvery day i dreaded waking up, it was a nightmare, the only thing that quelled my depression was the online world. I would only be able to make close connections with people online in my life, with few cases in real life. In middle school the roblox addiction got worse, i wouldnt eat for days, soda, chips. I made a handful of best friends on roblox but no best friends in real life, no sleepovers, no hanging out outside of school. I had \"friends\" in real life but they were surface level. I've never been one to start conversations but when I do they're boring, gossip, or telling stories at inappropriate times, i have no hobbies or goals to talk about or share and fear that any secret i tell will be used against me, it's led to a kind of social awkwardness, i dont know where it started though because i have lots of memories of me having socially awkward moments in the past but i dont know if it was just me being dumb, like i have a memory i always remember when in third grade recess this gay friend i had named cole always flirted with me and said we should go to the forest and have aex as a joke and when i decided to play along and say lets go to the forest he tried leading me to it, i didn't go because i knew what sex was from seeing porn at a young age, and having gay sex didn't look appealing to me so i just stared blankly daydreaming what would happen because i'd only seen straight sex, then i walked off.\n\nI think i have a case of social awkwardness because i laugh at degrading jokes towards others or random things, hell even sometimes i laugh at other peoples inside jokes and end up looking stupid, in PERSON im a pathalogical liar, it's almost like instinct for me to lie, someone asks me if i know someone, i say yes instantly, someone asks me if i know about anything and say yes instantly, they ask me if i did something bad even if theres proof in fromt of both of us, no instantly. I'll exaggerate scenarios, and lie about my hobbies and skills, in my head im insulting towards others picking apart every insecurity of theirs, thinking of howd they react if i made fun of them, i constantly phase in and out of talking to people from daydreams and hold grudges, i'm a vengeful person as well and whenever im wronged i instantly think of taking out my revenge and daydream a murder scenario, after i leave the daydream i freak the fuck out because it all seems realistic, its almost like my inner self randomly jumps in a movie theater and lets my vengeful emotional side take over, just watching every possible outcome if i took violent action. In person im mentally and physically slow, i have a hard time reacting to things and i speak very crooked sometimes.\n\nMeanwhile online I can be a confident person, an outspoken person, charismatic while relying more on being social than laughing at everything, im quicker to respond to questions, i speak better, even over discord voice calls, I lie one in a blue moon and im usually honest, and overall I'm smarter and make better decisions, i can articulate my thoughts better. In person it feels like that online confident self is trapped behind steel bars, it's like my brain knows how to respond in a proper way but my body acts on its own as if i have no control. In person, I'm incredibly rude at times and can barely read social cues unless they're obvious. I always have issues with seeking validation, although i love the way i look i always feel like somethings wrong unless a girl i like hypes me up, i feel great, like a recharged battery, then i just feel bad and depressed again after a couple days. Here's more things ive noticed:\n\n\\- i laugh a lot at things people say when they arent funny sometimes, its like my thoughts know its not funny but my body forcibly laughs, I grew up laughing at my dad whenever he called my mom names like fatass and cow, i didnt learn how mean it was, now that i say this, im only now realizing the weight behind words, ive never understood the differences between \"attacks\" and \"toxic behavior\", i would always think acting toxic was normal, and funny, and id laugh at it. but would only have any other reaction to what i took as attacks, if it was towards someone else id take more time to judge if it was funny or not, if it were me i would be extremely emberassed and angry at that person, confused if they hated me or not.\n\n\\- In middle school by the 7th grade I would be known for being an insulting person and talking lots of shit about people's appearances and \"roasting\" them and stupid shit like that, and it carried on to highschool, i developed this abusive tendency called \"negging\" where you bully others for validation, and i ended up baiting a couple dudes into that and it really creeps me out. id neg them into seeking my validation and when they showed they CARED for my validation i'd get weirded out by them and see them as creeps\n\n\\- i wouldn't have any attention span in class, either joking around, going on my phone, or playing with my pencil or any object; or most commonly, just staring forward blankly stuck in my own thoughts for long periods of time, randomly comimg im and out, snapping back into reality at random or when someone says my name. I remember one time i was so stuck in my head, i didnt notice i was playing with a girls hair that was in front of me in class, it happens when i speak to people a lot, it doesnt take much for it to happen extremely early after the first five words of a conversation too. i just drift off and act as if i heard everything, just saying \"wow\" after. If im not speaking to anyone it gets bad and i can stare at nothing for hours thinking of anything from stories, how i shouldve said things, how i shouldve responded, how im gonna change, how tomorrow ill be different. Usually i get into these a lot with my mom, most of our interactions it's almost like it automatically onsets and whenever she interrupts me, i dont get pulled out of it, i just pause it and when i do, i get extremely angry, i start saying shut up stupid bitch in my head over and over again until she stops, then i continue what i'm thinking\n\n\\- constant paranoia that someones going to come in my room and kill me ever since i was growing up in middle school and i believe this is a subconcious metaphor for my parents.\n\n\\- chronic online behavior leading to a difference in online and real life personality and attitude\n\n\\- when i smoke too much weed i have violent intrusive thoughts when im not daydreaming, and when i am daydreaming it's of violence and murder, back and forth. and if theres music or tv playing in the background it gets intensified and it feels like a fucking horror movie until i look around and wonder if where i am is even real\n\n\\- i have this weird tendency to always want to switch niches, one day i want to be a youtuber, then a soccer player, then a baseball player, then an actor, then a game developer, then a pro\n\nskateboarder. These kind of cycle a lot but I think I actually do want to be an actor because that's one goal I haven't shaken and I really want to depict characters in a beautiful way, but it's always at the end of my list, like my brain knows to start training now but then something overpowers me and tells me it's not as important as making a stop motition lego youtube channel for now instead.\n\n\\- I don't know who i am, when i think of myself i can only think of a blank plane, or an empty shadow, whenever i think of my face i never see MY face it's always a disfigured rendition of me or an empty face. I don't even know if I have a personality.\n\n\\- im terrified to ask questions, i cant even ask my friend a simple question as where their charger is without feeling scared and doubtful, as if my body is purposefully keeping itself quiet when i want to speak.\n\n\\- always subconciously take digs at people or compete in \"who's better\" at something\n\n\\- i dont eat if i mess up my routine, which is every day. Ill eat at most one meal, because i believe that i have to save my food for the future.\n\nWhen I wanted to try out for sports in highschool, my parents were starting to disallow me from socializing from anyone due to bad grades, i wanted to run track and do hurdles but since i was banned from hanging out with friends i gave up, and i regret it everyday and it makes me sad thinking that if i were any luckier i could've been in it. My online escape caused me to drop out of college out of a mix of depression and computer gaming addiction.\n\nThere may be more that I'm forgetting but i was floating around life like this for a while only to end up making the mistake of getting a dating app. After getting sexually assaulted by a woman and attempts of trying to gaslight myself that it didn't happen, i've become excruciatingly depressed, i haven't told anyone and whenever i think about it i can't even look anyone in the eyes, i could be happy and then i think about it. i've fallen into an even deeper depression and I don't know how I haven't shot myself yet, and i dont know why i haven't because the pain of everything hurts so much. Too top it off a \"situationship\" with a girl i was attached to broke my heart and i'm in the D1 depression leagues now. but although i'm teetering the fine line of ending my life she made me realize everything I speak about now was important to how I am now, I just haven't been able to find help or talk about this so I want to hear what others think i should do because ive run out of  options.\n\nI personally don't know what to do. This is the first time ive let anyone read into my life and it's gotten to the point where i don't know where to get help. i'm scared to open up to my parents because Ive always seen them as unpredictable enemies and im scared. i visitied a mental health clinic and they only offered group therapy vs an analysis of my mental health which had a 6 month wait time. I feel like I don't have 6 months because i'm already starting to feel like the more self aware of these problems i have, the more i lose myself to delusion like daydreams, paranoia and ghosting friends, i feel like i'm being disconnected from my body and I'm going to be controlled by another soul when I wake up. My paranoia is so bad i can't say or type certain words without feeling fearful like word that starts with G and in the middle has an O and the last letter is what comes after C.\n\nLastly, could I have any mental disorders? or is all or just outcomes of mild experiences? i seriously cant tell. all i know as of now is that I'm depressed, but not sleeping in your bed all day depressed, it's like my body is an empty shell and just moves for the hell of it, not doing anything productive. im so sad and scared and i just want to see my grandparents again and i saw this subreddit had the word parents in it and i just want a parent to hug me and tell me everythings okay because i cant stop crying and im realizing how awful my life is","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1676917562.0},{"title":"Why will my parents not acknowledge how they've hurt me?","author":"SaladCats_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/117n13r\/why_will_my_parents_not_acknowledge_how_theyve\/","text":"Why is it that some parents absolutely cannot acknowledge fault or failure and accept to work on themselves and stop their horrible behavior?\n\nI'm at the point where certain family members are such a detriment to mental health every time I come into contact with them that I feel like my brain is both scrabbled and numb.\n\nI'm trying to unscramble my brain, but I know I'll need several days if not a week to feel better.\n\nWhy do parents do this after I've made it clear their behavior is hurting me?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676933128.0},{"title":"How should I go about this flatmate situation?","author":"Same_Ad5014","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/117jw5t\/how_should_i_go_about_this_flatmate_situation\/","text":"This is a long story.\n\nThere are four flatmates : me, Sam, Rosie and Dave\n\nTwo weeks ago, Dave made some comments which basically equated war with hist struggles as a working class person. Sam and I disagreed but it soon escalated and I decided that didn\u2019t want to be part of this so came out of the argument and couldn\u2019t hear anything since people were just talking over one another. Rosie who had basically brought this topic up also stepped back. Dave ignored is for the next week and half.\n\nThe same night, Sam called me telling me she had a plan to invite our friendship group to a hangout in her room. I was fine with this because I know all these people and it sounded fun. This was meant to be on Sunday but a girl could not make Sunday so it was moved to Saturday on the friendship group chat. She knew I could definitely make Sunday evening and I TOLD HER I could come earlier on Sunday for gamesnight. I told her I would be elsewhere but if it\u2019s late can try and make it. However, a few answer later she decided that we should invite people I know including people who I just met. I was reluctant and told her I didn\u2019t like the idea because I didn\u2019t want to mess up any relationships I had with people I just met by inviting them to a random hangout. I also agreed to a shorter hangout since I was feeling low in energy and needed to recharge. and she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer until I felt quite frustrated and told her I was being serious. She got quite serious and started saying \u2018whatever you want\u2019 and I was like \u2018okay\u2019 and then she kept saying \u2018whatever you want\u2019.\n\nAnyway, a few days later, Rosie, Sam and I were talking about the argument and Rosie said that Dave was angry with us because comments on family were made. I thought he was talking about him thinking we were dismissing his struggles as being part of a working class family but it turned out that Sam had made a rude comment about his grandfather. Sam tried to defend herself saying she backtracked but Rosie repeated it was rude. I was surprised because I realised that her comment was the main reason we were being ignored and stated that this had nothing to do with me and I was basically like Rosie, someone who stepped out of the argument. I also highlighted it was her comment which got us into her mess especially after since the fight she kept saying she was happy it was both of us in the mess. I told her I don't understand why I am being ignored as well as being dragged into his. She wanted us to both go and try and make up with him but I was annoyed at Dave for ignoring me even though he was more rude to me than him implying his opinion was more important than mine.\n\nShe told me to not say that because it stressed her out . I knew she was stressed because Dave had confessed to her in November which is what she always refers to when talking about her stress). I told her that I also have stresses in my life (parents arguing, ADHD diagnosis and paperwork, minor surgery). I was already annoyed with her because I was beginning to see that she just wanted me to do what she wanted and always say herself as above other.\n\nFor example, she kept saying that her visiting her mother who had just come back from a different country after seeing her sick grandma was a family emergency but my grandmother undergoing surgery for diabetes was not. What annoyed me more was that I had not seen my mother in quite a few months due to my parents separating.\n\nI was quite stressed and realised I needed to leave. At the end of the argument I told her I wasn't coming to game night because she knew I was in another city then I hadn't said anything on the friendship chat about not being here Saturday because it felt unfair changing the entire plan because someone could not make it but I kinda regret it now. I also told her that she always wanted things her way referring to her trying to make me bring people over because she wanted more friends. I told her having random people at the party twas one of the reasons why I didn\u2019t want to come to gamesnight.\n\nAs I got up she did ask me if I wanted to talk about this but from experience I knew it was going to be fruitless.\n\nThe next day (Friday) we went to a dinner. Dave didn\u2019t come because he was still angry. We were somewhat cordial and I asked her what times the games night was tomorrow (Saturday) to see if I could be back in time and she said she didn't know so I jokingly asked her how she wouldn't know which made her exclaim 'Why are you asking?'. I realised she was obviously distressed so didn't probe further. Rosie asked me when I was going and when I would be back to dorms. I said Sunday probably the evening. Rosie was originally also coming \u2013 though not part of the friendship group \u2013 but told me that she had to do work.\n\nI went back home and had a gut feeling about how strange they had no idea what the time was so texted another girl in my friendship group (let's call her Alicia).\n\nAlicia was confused when I asked her what time it was on Saturday and told me the thing was on Sunday. I was shocked and thought it was weird the girl didn't tell me it was no longer on Saturday especially since she lives next to me and knew I would be back by Sunday evening so would know if there was an event in her room. Alicia then told me that the girl had asked to do it in someone else's room in another location. Alicia also told me another girl had thought it was weird I wasn't on the group chat and that this girl had told them I was uninterested and was away for the weekend. The group chat also only had members from our friendship group. This conversation happened Thursday night after our argument. I felt hurt but worse because I feel like Rosie already knew about the location changed and consequently pulled out because obviously she would be aware of whether or not there was a game sight in a room right next to hers\n\nShe knew I was excited for games night and the reasons I became reluctant was because of the timings and there being new people which was not the case anymore so I don\u2019t know why she told them that. Just to be careful, I sent a message on our flat chat saying I would be back for Sunday morning and see if anyone wants to go to brunch which she saw in case she thought the timings was a major obstacle.\n\nAlicia messaged Sam telling her that I did want to come but seemed confused with the timing and she added me to the group chat but said nothing. I didn\u2019t want to go but after discussing with other people, I decided it best to go because I still like the others there.\n\nSunday morning, she sent me a message saying Alicia told her I want to come and the timings (7pm) and location.\n\nI came back at around 1pm since nobody was going brunch. Basically, there is a single, shared fridge in our kitchen but for some reason the distribution of shelf space is very unequal with one of my \"friend\" having an entire top shelf and me and another girl sharing half. Usually, this is fine with me and if people run out of space on their shelf, they move it to their people's shelf since people have more since that fridge belongs to nobody.\n\nAnyway, I came back to dorm yesterday and put stuff in the fridge. I had little space but this girl had plenty of space and people usually put stuff on other people's shelves if they have no space due to the unequal distribution of shelf space. I went to games night where she asked me how my weekend was and I gave neutral answers but spoke to other people. I also still feel ill because it's not nice knowing your own flatmate and friend did something like this. I also felt stressed because I think anther Rosie knew about the timings but don\u2019t really care anymore.\n\nUsually we go together but I went alone because I have to walk and need sufficient time. She cycled She asked me how London was and I have one-words answers because the whole group chat thing felt super toxic. Also, I think this whole situation made me ill and worsened my early Hay fever so I looked so out of it.\n\nAnyway, today, I come back from lectures and I see that my food which took up barely any space on her shelf had been moved to someone else's smaller fridge shelf. She still had plenty of space and mat on her shelf. I believe she knew it was mine because it had the snacks she knew I liked and often joke about. I also knew she had no allergies or vegan\/ vegetarian so knew I could put stuff on that shelf. She was also the person who I knew who had an entire shelf. I moved my stuff back because it felt too petty since we're 20. She doesn't own the fridge and this feels like she has a more of a problem with me than the fact U put stuff on \"her\" shelf. This is a UK uni flat by the way.\n\nAlso, I can now here talking to Dave and Rosie saying things like 'I don't know what's her problem'. Dave is obviously quite forgiving.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

We bonded over being the only new starters in my team. \n\nI noticed early on that my friend was a compulsive liar, but I have been able to tolerate it until recently. There are also a couple other traits I\u2019ve struggled with (talking over others + sneaky personality) but these are minor comparatively. \n\nI moved teams at the end of last year and I won\u2019t lie, was excited to get some space.  However recently he\u2019s been everywhere I go - tagging along to my team events and even gone out of his way to organise events with my new team etc and it\u2019s gotten to a point where I struggle to even speak to him. \n\nWhere I need advice is that I do believe he is a genuinely kind person. Last year when I was put through some very difficult situations at work, he was a pillar of support for me and I feel indebted to him for this. I\u2019ve also observed how giving he is with his time for others around us as well. I am in no way trying to excuse his habitual lying, I just want to paint a picture of why I am struggling with this.\n\nI feel so bad for wanting space because I know he clings to me because he enjoys my company and I don't want to hurt him for that, especially since he's gone through some tough situations recently.

I've had a series of really really bad apartments with terrible neighbors and bad landlords. So I'm being really careful this time around and looking to spend a bit more to rent a house.\n\nThe person listing the house on Zillow was actually located in another state. When we showed up, I asked the older couple showing the house if they are the owners and they said yes. \n\nThe owners really made it seem like this house was in HIGH demand. It was so difficult to even get an appointment to tour (and finally they were like \"we have an opening in 2 hours if you can make it!\" then during the tour they were like \"yeah there are like 50 people who want to apply for this, it will likely be gone by the end of the week, maybe even today\" and showed me a notepad with a bunch of people's emails on it. \n\nAnyway, when I toured it, I immediately fell in love. It was pristine. New everything. Freshly painted SPOTLESS basement (it was some sort of plasticy\/rubbery finish that looked like a gym on the floors and walls). Cute backyard with a patio and fairy lights. \n\nThere were a couple of strange things\/signs of a flip: they put a decorative \"repurposed wood\" accent thing on one random section of the living room wall, like, 6 feet by 6 feet. There was electronic entry on the front and back door, grey vinyl plank flooring, the front door was painted teal, etc.\n\nBut it was really really cute. Anyway, I went home and felt kind of stressed about it since so many people wanted it. They'd emailed me the application form as promised but I realized I didn't really have any good references and hesitated to apply since I didn't think I'd get it. \n\nThe next day, the owner called me and left a voice mail that weirded me out. He referred to the house as his \"project\" and wanted to know if I'm still interested and if I am, he'd send over the lease. I was like wait what??? I didn't even submit an application, why would he want to send me the lease already? It was also weird because yesterday their whole vibe was \"lol apply or don't apply, there are like 50 people in line so we don't care\".\n\nSo I looked up the Zillow listing for this house last year and found pictures of it before it was flipped. Oh man it looked different. The basement looked like a normal old basement with some mildew and stains, the walls and ceilings in the kitchen\/rooms looked kind of warped and dated, etc. So I really started to suspect that these people did a lot of really pretty cosmetic upgrades and wondered if the actual house would have problems at best and be unsafe (shoddy electric work) at worst. \n\nOh, I also realized the weird random 6ft by 6ft repurposed wood decor was on the wall where the fireplace opening would be. Why would they cover that up? Just weird.\n\nThe owner called me AGAIN today but I didn't answer.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676657830.0},{"title":"Furnace out on a weekend...not sure what to do.","author":"Elarionus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/115h6gk\/furnace_out_on_a_weekendnot_sure_what_to_do\/","text":" Our  furnace stopped working at some point last night.

I met her this school year and it's like we've been friends for years. However, she always sticks around her best friend R (they've known each other longer.) I sit near them or beside them in all of my classes because I'm in a program that takes up all of 2nd sem.\n\nR is supposedly rich from what she constantly makes us hear, and from the start, she always irked me. She's overly \"friendly\" because she talks to a lot of people (probably so she can have more people to order around) but she only ever talks about herself. The first time I hung out with them at lunch, R spent all 45 minutes talking about herself NONSTOP about how rich she is and K was actually listening and laughing along. I'm a mouthy person too but not to the extent that R is and I make sure to let people talk as well. All R talks about is her family's \"6 million net worth\" their 4 properties and how if she wasn't attending our public high school she'd be in an academy with 10k tuition a year. Despite all that bs she genuinely thinks she doesn't brag and she's being humble. It's like she thinks she's the rich girl in some sort of sitcom and we're her peasant side character friends.\n\nAnyways, the school started handing out honour rolls and I mentioned I was proud I was even part of that list and she scoffed and went on about how she should've had Honour Roll with Distinction because she has a 3.8 GPA which I think is funny. After all, so far on every test I've seen R peek at K's work and copy everything, but K just lets her. Every time we have a worksheet handed out she sneaks up beside me and copies from me or some of her other friends and refuses to do any work herself.

I recently got a tentative offer for a federal government job after just about 3 months of waiting. It amounts to low level admin work.. but it pays double what I made last year and I feel like it will have good benefits. Thing is I have read so many things online about offers being rescinded or terrible management or people being taken off a position at the absolute last minute after they had planted roots in a new city. I feel like I'll be another statistic in this case. My parents are absolutely extatic about me getting this job offer, meanwhile I've read a lot on it and feel I'm in a precarious spot until my butt is in the office and I'm beyond my 1-2 years of probation.\n\nI have never made more than 30k in a year, and this position will offer me mid 50s within a few years if all goes well. The key is everything going well. I am legally blind, and have a hard time reading\/writing on forms.. what if I mark something incorrectly and its seen as a lie? What if my manager turns out to be a vindictive person who puts all new hires through \"hell probation\" to make sure they meet standards? What if I go totally blind during the probation (I have retina issues) and I can't adapt fast enough to the workload?\n\nNow add on that I'm moving 3 states for this job to a VHCoL area, with not much savings. If anyone has worked federally and can comment that'd be super cool -. I don't want to give my life to the state, but I do hope to have a fulfilling career in public service and get myself stable before I go blind. That is kind of the key here, the health benefits and services are leagues ahead of what I have in the South.

I've got osteoporosis really bad, and it shows. \n\nI also have primarily inattentive ADHD not medicated and have only recently been in my 31 years (started at 30yo.) Real big eye opener, but afraid it's way too late for me to make any big changes enough for me to be independent. Meant to commit suicide at 18, but I just didn't, so here I am with absolutely nothing because of my inability to listen to good and helpful advice, wrecklessness, drug addiction, and suicidal ideation. \n\nKind of a hail Mary because >of my inability to listen to good and helpful advice, so I'm hoping something I read will actually and finally inspire me to go through with this. Especially because I know I should have stopped a long time ago, but for some reason, this time, I'm not able to stop. I did get myself to actually stop a few times, but something or someone always pulled me back into it. \n\nHell, I'm so into it and the idea of it nowadays, I don't know if rehab will pull me out of this (so here go the suicidal thoughts, YAY...) I'm so used to having these thoughts. It's something I've unfortunately grown to accept about myself \n\nI've got no hope left. I have no desire to live, and nothing interests me. Except for video games, but those only last so long, and I've been doing that since I was a kid. They dont get you very far as a non-professional. Having ADHD makes wanting other hobbies very difficult due to the fact that video games are instant gratification. I've got no motivation, none to even exercise to mitigate some of this damage I'm doing to myself. I stop for a few days and put my weight back on, and start to feel better. But that's when the urges REALLY hit. \n\nI can't stop myself. \n\nI feel like I'd be better off with a keeper or *something*, but who does that? I can't trust myself by myself, so being independent is a risk in and of itself. I feel like I've only one way out, and it's not the happy kind. \n\nADHD is really a huge impairment for me because it affects literally every aspect of my life. (I mean, obviously, but more so for me. I see functional ADHDers, and I applaud and envy them.) From the mundane to the more complex, I procrastinate, dread, and ultimately and reluctantly complete tasks. Even if it's something important. If it doesn't pique my interest, it can wait (so to speak). \n\nDrugs make having ADHD symptoms even worse (obviously, but don't tell ME that!) Everything is that much more difficult for me. Mostly because of the avoidance that accompanies drug use, so coupled with the pre-progammed ADHD avoidance, it's *DEADLY.* \n\n^(Obviously, I'm being overdramatic, but you get it.)\n\nI'm a classic, doesn't-like-state-changes, kind of ADHDer. If I can keep my routine from changing too much, then that's what I'll likely do. \n\nOne upside is I enjoyed physical labor, but nowadays, I'm too self-conscious about my appearance that I'm just basically a shut-in. It'll likely be upwards of the $50,000 for facial reconstruction surgery that I'll need to get a semblance of normal or at least that healthy appearance, but I lost my last job (which was actually the best job I ever had because I enjoyed it so much) because I succumbed to drug use after switching from that job (typical addicted me move) to a hotel job because of the allure of health insurance. \n\nIn hindsight, worst decision of the last couple of years. I lost the fillings I used my health insurance for, regained the depression I overcame after living with it for 13 years (which i now attribute the last 11 years of depression to drug abuse), and walked out of that job because they watched me like hawks and even blamed me for something I didn't do (even though the person responsible spoke up and had to absolve me, despite the 'hawk eyes.') It was then after my 2nd spiral to rock bottom that I had finally been medicated for ADHD. (Apparently, not having medication can lead to or cause depression)\n\nWhat. A. Fucking. Eye. Opener that was. Aside from the obvious mental focus benefits it provides, It was like everything I couldn't understand about myself and the reasons why I did things the way I did suddenly made sense. Why I was an angry kid grew more and more apparent the more time I spent with the meds. \n\nIt provided clarity. Clarity that has remained, even after discontinuing use (because of the no job, not because it's something I know I should continue using daily, obviously) Something I could have used literally anytime in the past 13 years (which I call my clouded judgment years.)\n\nI could have avoided so much pain and heartache had I not listened to my brother and his reaction to medication. He's primarily hyperactive\/impulsive. I believe he said he \"felt like a zombie\" because at that age, he was used to having so much energy, focus didn't matter to him, so he wildly went through everything. Having everything slow down and being able to breathe was so foreign to him, it was just incomprehensible.\n\nBeing somewhat of a movie buff, I was afraid of what Hollywood portrayed being a medically induced \"zombie\" would be like. I seent Girl, Interrupted. I did not want that. I was young. I didn't have much to reference, so I spent my 20s without much needed medication. \n\nHell, I would have benefited the most at a very young age, but my mother, being the one most involved with our education, failed to provide me with something that would have exponentially improved my life to the point where I wouldn't even be in my current situation. She said she didn't get me tested because I didn't display any symptoms despite displaying inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and hyper-focus, to name a few. She was comparing me to my brother, who, upon meeting, you'd think he'd be on something, but no, his mind will just not let him sit still for very long. He HAS to be handling something or looking for something to handle. He absolutely, most positively, HAS to interrupt or finish your sentence, despite having being told no to his many guesses to what you were trying to say.\n\nSo to those standards, despite having been told it's a hereditary disorder, I was good! I mean, it's not like she could really inspect me while I'm hyper-focused on video games, ignoring my homework in the other room my entire childhood. Or at school where I had to be bribed with cookies to get focused on class work (in 3rd grade).\n\nI mean, why wouldn't you do everything you can to help your kids excel at school, knowing, without a doubt that one has a hereditary disorder. (We (4) all have it, just varying degrees. He and I, the youngest, have it MUCh worse than our sisters)\n\nEven then, I was doing what I could to maximize my hyper-focus. I could have had the clarity, focus, the drive it could have given me to succeed! But yet, there I was, declining the spelling bee, declining the confidence she put on me. To play video games... \n\nOh, did I mention I'm really bad at making (good) decisions? Yeah, story of my life. I'm not THE brightest person, but I'm also not the dullest tool in the shed. Having ADHD does things to you... ^(if you know, you know) I guess I can attribute a lot of my early life to bad decision-making because of fear. Fear of not knowing the outcome. Fear of going out of my comfort zone. Fear of losing friends. But nowadays, I *would* make better decisions if not for this fucking addiction. Nowadays, I can't get the thought of using out my head for more than a week. Hell, even having the manual labor job (I went back to the same one) didn't stop me from doing it every (other) week. \n\nHad I not met the girl in high school ^((which i most definitely would have avoided had i had medication)) who introduced me to the guy who introduced me to this hellish drug, I would not be here typing this. I'd gladly trade having been her friend for my health and sanity. \n\nI'm not 20 anymore, I don't bounce back after a day or so like I used to. *I'm falling apart, and I'm scared.*\n\nI guess the thing now is that I have to deal with lying to my dad recently about using. He's the one I'd reach out to, but ADHD, guilt, and the desire to keep using is keeping me from getting to rehab (which would be in a town 2 hours away, one way.) He's the one who got me the manual labor job. \n\nI was even working with him for a while, which I'm sure he was really excited about. It gave us time to talk and connect with each other, which really never happened before because he was usually at work or working on some project. And I was usually out and about or on my console games (and he's not going to just initiate a conversation like that. He's old school and never really shown any interest in video games.) I'm not bitter about it, though. (ok, maybe a little bit. I feel some of my depression stems from not having a meaningful connection with any of my family) He's actually a chill guy if you're not screwing up. \n\nI even opened up to him about my suicidal ideation. We cried together and he asked me to stay here, alive with him, so I promised I would. It's getting worse, though. I don't want to live like this. I don't want to keep using. I can't stop myself from using. The ADHD is bad (and much worse on drugs), so the change of state (sobriety) is terrifying to me for some reason. \n\nWhat if I relapse? What if I ultimately believe any amount of rehab cannot change this? What if bad things (you know which)?\n\nI guess what I'm asking is, how do you make a time machine? ^(j\/k)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676607324.0},{"title":"Where can I put my money into that's not. savings or checking account?

I'm sorry that I'm asking for too much, but I really need to talk to people. I know that what I'm about to say is above the paygrade of this place, but I won't be able to go to a therapist appointment for at least another week, due to being busy with school and work. I just want to talk to people about this.\n\nMy parents came from a conservative background on top of being Christian. Despite this, I came out to them(not as lgbtq but as a crossdresser) because I wanted to be honest and truthful with them. I was hoping for reluctant acceptance. Here are some of the words they said to me:\n\n \\- Only psychopaths crossdress! I did not raise a psychopath and if you turn out to be one I am done with you! (Mom) If you crossdress or are gay I'm kicking you out of the house!\n\n \\- God gave you a man's body for a reason(Both).\n\n \\- Only creeps will look at you and compliment you. This is how you get molested! (Mom)\n\n \\- Do you plan to molest children? (Dad)\n\n \\- You need to respect yourself as a man and only dress in men's clothing! Crossdressing is sick and shameful! Never do that again! You disrespect everything a man stands for! I will be ashamed if you ever dress like that outside in public! (Dad)\n\n \\- Crossdressing is how sickos hook up with each other! (Both)\n\nAnd now for the most hurtful comment:\n\n \\- Should I have beat and cursed at you? Where did I go wrong? Maybe I should've abused you for you to become more like a man! (Dad)\n\nI don't think anyone I've talked to so far truly understands how much those words hurt me... Because all of this love that they previously showed me, all of the support and tough love, the stern lectures, it's all fake. This is the most vulnerable I've ever made myself to ANYBODY and they shat on that trust. The people who matter most to me in the world, the people who are supposed to love me the most; they don't even love me.\n\nThey don't love me, they only love the idea of me. My own parents despise who I actually am.\n\nWhat's wrong with crossdressing? I'm not hurting anyone... and how does it make me lesser? Is mom lesser than dad? No. And I'm still me when I crossdress. All the qualities I have which you say you're proud of, fitness, good grades, patience towards my baby cousins, respect and patience towards others, politeness, the amount of consideration I have towards others... I still have those on the inside. The only thing that's changed is the outside. Why do you think all of that changes when the outside changes? And isn't the outside supposed to be the least important part of people? Why are you so shallow? I just want to have fun expressing a cute and playful side of me...\n\nThe people I have talked to about this say that I need to consider their feelings too. They both come from a background where that's a huge nono. Being lgbtq means going to hell. I'm their baby and parents dedicate their lives to their children. Me coming out may have forced them to re-contextualize our whole relationship. Me opening up must've hurt them, and I think it must've shocked them to their core.(It seems like that was the case with my dad) I've also realized that when I get mad, I tend to hurl insults at people. I got that from them, and they were in the heat of the moment.\n\nI know that and yet I still can't understand them. I'm too hurt to understand them. I'm too hurt by their comments and the fact that they will never love me for who I truly am; they will never give up their religion. That idea is not worth entertaining at all. I'm in the process of grief because I don't love them anymore though I wish with all my heart that we could both love and accept each other.\n\nOne person(P1) I talked to says that I shouldn't burn down these bridges, but that's exactly what I want to do. The other person(P2) agrees. I think they're right but I can't help but tell them that that idea can go fuck itself. I can't stomach the fact that, if I want there to be a chance of my parents of accepting me(nothing is a given) I'm gonna have to go through so much pain. I'm gonna face constant threats, judgement, and disappointment from the people who control everything in my life, who I see every day, 24\/7. I'm gonna have to suffer so much just for only a CHANCE of acceptance. As the one without power in the relationship, I'm gonna have to feel the most pain. Maybe I'm wrong but I think it's so unfair that I, the one with the least power in this lopsided relationship, have to put in THE MOST BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS BY FAR just to have a normal relationship... that idea makes me sick. Do I really have to do this?\n\nAnd for what? Being lgbtq and a crossdresser isn't even that big of a fucking deal! I remember telling my friend that wow, I thought I would change after discovering this part of me. But no, I'm literally just some dude. Just a little different, but ultimately I'm just some dude. Why is this such a big deal!?\n\nI want nothing more than to just go far, far away and live a life where I'm not in danger for simply just being different.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1676509531.0},{"title":"My sister is being excluded in school","author":"Sure_Ad9924","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/113birl\/my_sister_is_being_excluded_in_school\/","text":"The life at home has been hectic since my parents divorced.

I had a terrible experience in school when I was younger and that led to a lot of trauma and trust issues around teachers so it's kinda been a rocky start. I'm 15 and a boy by the way.\n\nWell, so yesterday I had a really really bad day and I was having a really hard time with being trapped in a building I wasn't used to and didn't feel safe in. One of my new teachers (who knows about my old experiences and has been working with my mum to make the transition easier) saw that I wasn't going to class after lunch and immediately confronted me about it. \n\nI know I'm in the wrong for this part but I couldn't think straight and everything was so overwhelming that I just kept my headphones on and told her to piss off. Long story short, she called my mum and she came to the school to pick me up. She just dropped me off at home because she had to go back to work. \n\nI was really really angry and my brain was all wonky because I didn't even fully know what was happening and some of the things she said brought up too many bad memories so I got home really upset. I was crying and not really thinking straight and I completely lost it the second I came in the door. My headphones are now broken because I threw them against the door and my tablet is dented and shattered (still functional) because of the same reason. \n\nI also punched a hole in my living room wall. There was a painting leaning up against it anyway so I just moved it a few centimetres to cover it and it's been like that since. My hand is slightly bruised and there's a few small cuts but nothing major. My mum hasn't noticed. \n\nI feel absolutely terrible about it.

I feel like I can't see a career path that's both financially feasible and won't destroy my mental health, and I'm writing hoping you'll have some advice or just love to share.\n\nLet me get you up to speed. I'm still working my first two jobs out of college (the one on the crisis hotline, and a newer one in case management; 24 hours per week each). It's been good for a couple years, but the case management job just *retracted* one of my disability accommodations, and I can't afford to fight it. Luckily, the hotline healthcare is great; the only thing I'm using the case management job's healthcare for is... well, my therapist. I've been applying to other jobs, but it'd mean a pay cut of around $5,000-7,000\/year since part time jobs in my field are rare and even full time would be less hours. Plus, if I got a new job I might need to start over with a new healthcare team (because insurance), which is scary being disabled. But I'm not sure I can do both jobs much longer without completely losing it mental health wise, especially since I've been treated so horribly by the one.\n\nThere's one glimmer of hope: I'm enrolled in a career training program for a therapy certification that's expected to be in very high demand once I graduate in May. The catch though is that it's a totally new field \u2013 like, I'm in the first group of people who will *ever* graduate and be licensed to do it. Which is cool, but also means that, like, the director of our school has explicitly told us we shouldn't quit our day jobs. All my classmates are planning to become independent contractors, but I do NOT want to do that \u2013 thinking about having to track all my earnings and register a business and figure out my own healthcare and get my own liability insurance and market myself to clients all without having a guaranteed income basically makes me want to jump off the planet. I'm scared that it'll be much more attractive for employers to book independent contractors to minimize costs, and I'll be left behind.\n\nMom, Dad, what do I do? Should I quit the case management, try to scrape by on half my current income and maybe pick up extra hours on the hotline, take a bit of a break from working so much, and hope that things work out with my new certificate in May? Should I try to stick it out with both jobs for the money and healthcare, even though one isn't respecting me anymore and is destroying my mental health? Is being an independent contractor way easier than I think it is? Is everything gonna be okay?\n\nP.S. Full disclosure, I'm probably just spiraling tonight because I had to pause my [beta blockers](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/heart-disease\/beta-blockers#uses) to prepare for a diagnostic heart procedure tomorrow, but knowing that doesn't make things feel better. Plus, all this stuff has been bothering me since well before I stopped the meds, so it's real... just a lot worse tonight.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1675832901.0},{"title":"My son would be 4 tomorrow","author":"saftey_dance_with_me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/10vvqf7\/my_son_would_be_4_tomorrow\/","text":"I thought this would get easier over time but it hasn't.

I am planning to obtain full-time employment and begin a part-time master's degree this summer, but I'm having trouble deciding which degree to pursue.\n\nTL;DR - Should I pursue an MBA or a Master's of Applied Business Analytics?\n\nI am considering two different programs, either an MBA or Applied Business Analytics. The two programs are very similar - I could pursue either in a part-time capacity with a similar timeline and similar cost. The big question is which program would better equip me to reach my career goals?\n\nIdeally, I would like to be able to work remotely in a position with standard hours and time off. Think a regular 9-5 job, five days each week. While a role with higher compensation is obviously nice, the main priority is quality work\/life balance. In terms of the work itself, I currently have a general interest in roles with titles like business analyst, project management, or operations and logistics management. However, I'm open to any direction that is a good fit and I'd like to be able to grow in my career.\n\nThe MBA program has a set of core courses and then you can select one or two concentrations to add. For a concentration, I would likely pursue finance, human resources, or a pairing of international business and marketing management.\n\nThe Applied Business Analytics program is similar in that it has a set of core courses and a concentration. The main difference from the MBA is that there are fewer requirements for the core, so you take an additional elective and complete either a capstone project or an internship. There are two concentrations I would potentially pursue, either marketing or operations & supply chain management.\n\nI think the analytics degree would help me really specialize and define my career, and I also have the general impression that it would be easier to maintain work-from-home status? My biggest concern though is that it would lock me in to a specific trajectory, while the MBA would give me a lot more flexibility to change and advance my career. The analytics could also result in a position where I'm exclusively working with data and spreadsheets, while the MBA could provide a role with more broad responsibilities. I'm not necessarily opposed to data and spreadsheets, but I'm hesitant to pursue a direction where it would be my entire job.\n\nAlso, just for additional context: I am currently a full-time law student with a part-time job in college athletics. I've realized that those two directions aren't what I want out of life, hence the change. My undergraduate degree is business management, with a concentration in human resources and minors in accounting and business analytics. Most of my work experience is in college athletics, incorporating a variety of tasks with an emphasis on research and statistical analysis.\n\nSorry for writing such a long post, but thank you in advance for your help! I would really appreciate any thoughts you have on the topic :)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675816063.0},{"title":"Mixing bleach s? and ammonia??

I understood that I could not change people's positions and had a general idea that \"people are stupid\" so it was easy to engage and disengage when people were being unreasonable, etc. \n\nIn the modern era, however, being unreasonable (lying, manipulating, refusing to acknowledge reality) has become the dominant force of a major political party.  That has emboldened many members of society to continue this behavior in their personal lives.\n\nFrom my experience people have become significantly more resistant to changing their viewpoints or even **acknowledging reality.**  I have had exchanges both in person and online when I provide someone with the specific data to show that perhaps a 'feeling' is not always accurate.  I try to be gentle and sincere not \"gotcha\".\n\nAt this point it seems fairly clear to me that people just want to believe what they want to believe, regardless of the truth.  I am very affected when I see people **lying to others** or misrepresentation the truth in an effort to mislead them.\n\nI can no longer have civilized conversations with these people, and have started to become aggressive and genuinely angry when approaching them.  I no longer attempt to engage with these people online, but have found that their misinformation and manipulation is spreading both in my community and my country.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know how to interact with people who deny reality even when presented with the facts\/data.  At this point it makes me viscerally angry which is a disservice to myself and to others.  I don't know how to stop being gaslit by these people, but I don't feel I can ignore them for fear of the problem expanding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has been getting worse and worse over the past 4+ years.  I don't know what to do.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1675788060.0},{"title":"Thinking of ending my life but also thinking of my mom\u2026","author":"Cloud_light7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/10vclwp\/thinking_of_ending_my_life_but_also_thinking_of\/","text":"Just got dumped and now I\u2019m just so lost that I just want to end it all.

I've come to ask for advice on the same issue again. I've deleted my previous posts as it's been over a year now, but the situation is the same.\n\nI (20F) have a very strained relationship with my father(53M). I live with my parents, but I don't know how to get my shit together and finally move out. \n\nMy main reason as to why I want to move out is so I can get away from my father. He's been unemployed on and off for over 4 years now, working for a couple weeks at a time at most. I'm sick and tired of tolerating a man-child who can't take care of himself, let alone even help to support a family. Most of my wage and stipend from college has gone to his bills and payments, cause he doesn't maks any money.\n\nI really REALLY want to move out but every time I bring up the topic of it, he keeps telling me that I won't be able to live alone and why would I need to move out if I can just keep my job, help support the family and live in his house etc, etc. \n\nI was very close to just up and disappearing back in December after he lost his marbles at me and told me to get out and kill myself. Although I was kind of provoking him by saying that he's unappreciative of my financial support, I didn't think it would cause that kind of a reaction. He gave me a half-assed apology by saying he got upset at me by putting him down, but the only reason I even went back was because he threatened my mom with divorce and moving out if I didn't forgive him. \n\nThis is not the first time he's lost his tempter like this. It happens every couple of months and he goes back to pretending like nothing ever happened after a couple of hours of being upset.\n\nI feel really sorry for my mom that she has to deal with him. She doesn't want to get a divorce cause they've been in a relationship for 30 years now and they've committed way too much. My 29 year old brother also lives with us and is financially supporting basically the whole household. \n\nI'm gonna be graduating from college in June and I'm planning on writing a note and just disappearing. I have places to go and stay, worst case scenario I'll couch hop and rent a place after a month or two. However I feel like I won't have the guts to actually do it. I'm scared he'd somehow find me and drag my ass back home. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. Please, I just want this nightmare to finally end. \n\nTL:DR: My father doesn't want me to move out and it's draining my mental health and wallet.

It\u2019s embarrassing to admit, but I haven\u2019t even kissed anybody or even so much as held somebody\u2019s hand. I don't actually mind being single, I'm not really lonely, but it does bother me that I haven't reached this milestone other people my age have long since passed.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go into too many details about my childhood, but I was raised in an abusive household and was kept largely isolated from ages 13-18. It has definitely stunted me socially, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve spent the last 10 years recovering from. I\u2019m finally at the point where I feel I\u2019m ready to try dating, but I don\u2019t really know how it works or what to expect.\n\nI admit, I don\u2019t see why somebody would want to date me. I feel like I\u2019m a pretty boring person and that I\u2019m not what most men are looking for. I don\u2019t do much - just go to work and chill with my pets. I\u2019d love to do more things but I\u2019ve been very limited in what I can do by my anxiety disorder - I don\u2019t like doing things, especially new things, alone. Unfortunately I don\u2019t really have many friends so I don\u2019t go out much, though I have pushed myself out of my comfort zone and done things alone before, it just takes a lot out of me. I have one friend that I had from before I was isolated that I managed to reconnect with a few years ago.\u00a0\n\nWhen I told my friend I was interested in dating she said she has somebody she wants me to meet, and from what little she told me about him, he sounds like somebody I could really get along with. She wants to give him my number, but I'm nervous about it. I don't really text, and even online I lurk more than I post. I'm afraid that I'm going to come across as weird or stupid or just not know what to say. That happens to me a lot - not knowing what to say.\u00a0\n\nI also had some questions about dating that may or may not be really stupid that I'm too embarrassed to ask anywhere else:\n\nI\u2019m not sure what somebody really talks about on a date? What kind of questions should I be asking them? Usually, when I talk to people, I just find myself talking about animals, but I know I can\u2019t just spend a date talking about animals the whole time. I feel like I have less to talk about due to those years I was isolated from people outside my family - I don't really have stories from my life.\u00a0\n\nThis is probably a really dumb question, but how often should you try to see somebody you're dating? Once a week? Multiple times a week? I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m the opposite of clingy. While I don't like going out alone, I do like being alone. One of my fears about dating has been that I will find it suffocating because it cuts into my alone time.\n\nI don\u2019t use social media besides reddit and tumblr, which I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing. Should I make some sort of social media profile?\n\nI don\u2019t like makeup or other \u2018girly\u2019 things (no hate for women\/girls that do it\u2019s just not for me) and I\u2019m worried that somehow puts me at a disadvantage?\n\nSome random \u2018positive\u2019 things about myself since I was pretty negative about myself above. I love animals, plants, and gardening. I like hiking but I haven\u2019t done many \u2018real\u2019 hikes. I want to learn about foraging for mushrooms - I even attempted to train my dog to find truffles. I really care about the environment and biodiversity but I still have a lot to learn about it. I keep tarantulas and fish along with my dog and want to add more creatures to my menagery so anybody I date has to be cool with animals of all kinds. I also collect houseplants but I have a habit of neglecting them so I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a positive. People in my life say I'm very kind and passionate about things I care about.

Am I being irrational?","author":"LittleLumaCat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/10u4bsd\/i_think_my_childhood_friend_killed_my_cats_am_i\/","text":"Two of them, actually. The first one in 2014, the second in 2021.\n\n In 2013, him and his family lived with us while they were looking for a new place to stay. My stepdad agreed to letting them stay before he found out they had 57 housepets (animal hoarders). Their family, and the fifty seven (that wasn't a typo or exaggeration) pets moved in for 3 months. When they finally left, we weren't on very good terms terms. Shortly after, we found one of my two cats dead in the driveway. It was odd though, he was placed directly in front of the rear passenger wheel on a day my mother was supposed to work at 7 AM. She called in sick, when she drove me to school, I found my cat stone cold. Had she driven off to work like she was supposed to, she would have run his body over. He was young, but we didn't think anything of it. Just figured he'd eaten something poisonous or something. \n\nFast forward 7 years, to 2021 and I run into one of the kids from the family. I was more friends with his brother, he was a year or two older and bit of a 'bully'. I figured we could put all of that behind us, have a drink, and move on. He came over, and we got chatting. Things were going well for the most part, I showed him my three cats, the conversation was relatively normal until covid came up. Then, he brought up some new world order stuff and I kind of tuned out. When I tuned back in, he'd gone full Ted K, talking about how somebody needs to mail bombs to the US federal reserve (we're canadian btw). When we were kids, he'd say stuff like \"my grandpa can build a hydrogen bomb that would contaminate your property for a hundred years\" (y'know, normal 10 year old stuff, right?). As such, I didn't think a whole lot of his unabombish comments, I just attributed it to him being edgy\/attention seeking like he was nearly a decade prior. He asked me to ask my stepdad to put a word in for him at some local small hangars\/regional airlines (in northern ontario, operating bushplanes built 70 years ago, nothing big or pressurised). Needless to say his recomendation didn't go anywhwere. \n\nTwo weeks later, one of my three cats goes missing. I took time off work to call her, I even bought a megaphone. I live for my cats. It took me a few days to find the body. It was in a garden across from my makeshift summer bunkhouse. Eyes and mouth open. Same position as my cat John, no signs of injury. I was heartbroken and devastated. I adopted her as a bit of a therapy animal during the beginning of covid, she'd go everywhere with me, from the bank to shopping. I went into a spiral that took me a long time to crawl out of. I'm an avoidant person and I'd chosen not to put too much thought into how my cat died. I was more disheartened than anything and didn't even think about placing blame on anyone. I attributed it to a respiratory illness since she was still a kitten. \n\nLast week, we put my dad's dog down, and as he took his final breaths in my arms, I couldn't help but think of my poor little Luma. I felt sad that nobody held her as she took her last gasps. That night, I kept ruminating on that thought until the dots felt like they connected- it was like memories I forgot I even had came back. Since then, I haven't been able to shake the thought that my cat(s) may have been killed by my childhood friend. After thinking about it some more, I can remember him mistreating his animals. He grew up around animal neglect and abuse. I've seen him grab chickens by the feet, swing them around, throw them, and then laugh about it. He also threw kittens that could hardly walk off the roof of his garage onto the trampoline when he was 10-12. He was babysitting us (we were 10, 9, 7) and encouraged us to do the same. \n\n\nAm I thinking irrationally here? I'm trying very hard to compartmentalize the emotions I have towards the situation. Given the time that's passed, I'd like to think that I'm thinking logically, but I'd really appreciate some second opinions here.

There's a lot to it, but I'm not struggling with the material or the work itself - it's more of an issue of getting the work in on time. While this seems like an obvious requirement of college, there's more to it than just poor time management or something like that. I struggle with my mental health (treatment-resistant depression, panic disorder) and was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago, and in the past year I've been having a few chronic\/medium-term health issues that are too complicated to really get into here. In the spring of 2022, I ended up taking incompletes in two classes for the semester due to these health issues. I really thought I would have no issue getting what was a substantial, but not colossal amount of work done by the end of the fall 2022 semester, at which time they would lapse to an F on my transcript. But again, sh\\*t hit the fan with my health and they did. I also ended up having to take incompletes again in nearly all of my classes for the fall semester, which I have to finish this semester. I know there was so much that happened for me to end up in the position that I'm in right now, including not having the option of medical withdrawal for financial reasons, but I'm still really upset at myself that I got myself in this situation. (For this reason, I do ask that people try to refrain from offering advice along the lines of 'you shouldn't be in college right now until you're mature enough to handle things' because this and worse are very much a part of my negative self talk right now and very much not helpful for self reflection right now. As I'm trying to remind myself, a lot of the factors leading up to this were outside of my immediate control.) Things are more under control, though not perfect, with my physical now than the were a month or two ago.\n\nFor the incompletes that lapsed to Fs, I spoke to the academic advising office at my college and they said that while they appeared on my transcript like that at the moment, I could file an \"extension of incomplete\" petition and it would change back to an incomplete. They said that this petition would very likely go through given the circumstances, but I need instructor approval to submit this petition in the first place. This means reaching out to the two instructors who gave me incompletes in the spring and explaining my circumstances and BEGGING for their approval here. I am thinking that it would be best to get the outstanding work done first and then reach out to them with the completed work so that they're not left wondering if or when they're going to receive it. I'm having a bit of trouble completing the work right now as I get so anxious that it's not going to be accepted every time I open it, but hopefully I'll be done with it soon, as there's not too much left. My question here is wtf do I say to them??? I feel like I had all this time and I didn't communicate to them as this was going on, which was dumb, but at the time I felt like I should focus more on getting the work done than explaining to them what was going wrong.\n\nOne of the instructors I think I might have a decent chance with. I did very well on the tests in that class and participated in class and came to office hours, and we generally had a good relationship, though it was a big class so I didn't get to know him that well. He was extremely accommodating in giving me the incomplete in the first place and was very supportive and willing to help. But I'm worried since I didn't communicate here and didn't show him a serious commitment in the fall semester to getting it done, he won't be as inclined to help me this time. The other I feel less confident about - for her, it was only a small amount of work that I had to get in, but we were originally thinking I'd get it in by the end of the summer, and I didn't stick to that timeline (I got the majority of it done and then things got bad with my health). I'm registered with the disabilities office of my school and have some documentation of these issues, so hopefully that should help, but I really don't know what to say at this point when I haven't communicated in so long.\n\nThe outcome of this will seriously affect my decision to remain in college after this semester or drop out for the time being. I really do want to continue college, but if I fail classes, it will 1) eliminate my chances of transferring colleges, which is somewhat important because I'm unhappy where I am right now and would like to be closer to home in case of health emergencies, and 2) just make it really difficult to move forward with my classes and really f\\*ck with my confidence. Thankfully, though it will really tank my GPA, I will narrowly avoid academic probation still.\n\nAlso, I don't want to cut my losses here because this is so significant to me, but I need to get a grip on this situation soon because I have to handle my incompletes from last semester now too.\n\nI'm just panicking and I feel like I've spent so much time overthinking this that I'm losing my objective perception of the situation.

There is so much complexity and not enough staff to handle it all in my department.  And it's all been weighing on me hard.\n\nSo, I went on LinkedIn and indicated that I was looking for work, despite only being at my current job 7 months.  And I got contacted by someone about a job that is currently only a year assignment.  A really great job.  At a really great organization.  So I interviewed and they want me!  Here's the thing, it is a temp job.  So everything goes through the agency that was recruiting me.  I'm in my early 50s with health issues, so I am starting to worry the health insurance at this agency won't be good enough to help me through this year.  I do expect this temp assignment to turn into something permanent at the end of the year, but I am not sure the wait is worth it.  I also won't get any PTO, but that's not a big deal.  I can roll with it, but maybe not, if I get sick?\n\nI talked to both of my parents today about this and I'm still not sure what to do.  The thing is I really really want to quit my current job.  So I don't know what to do.  I have 2 more interviews on Monday, but with recruiters, so I'd still be at my current job a bit longer.  I suppose it's worth it in terms of the insurance and stuff.

I don't venturing out of my comfort zone, although I know it's necessary for change and I know nothing in life can stay the same forever. I (20s\/F) and my mom have always been super close and now she is moving out with her new husband this month. It's hard for her because she also has anxiety and a hard time with change. Living alone is also a slightly scary thought to me, but I think I could adjust to it with time. \n\nMy LDR partner and I will have been together in June this year. We would like to close the distance and we have plans of moving into his state together, I'll be moving from Michigan to Arizona. Besides some trips, I've never lived outside of Michigan or far from my mom. I'm experiencing a lot of anxiety at the moment alongside all of the excitement. I feel stable in my relationship, but there is always the little voice in the back of my head that says \"you will only have been together for a year, do you really feel like it's stable enough to take this jump?\". Which I do consciously, but there is still a tiny voice of doubt because I'm scared of taking such a big leap. How do I maintain my relationships with my family, especially my mom, if I'm moving so far away? It's all I've ever known and thinking about it makes me so upset. \n\nRegarding a new job, I am in the process of changing companies right now. There is always an accepted risk of leaving one job for another. I'm leaving a large, well-established company for a smaller startup. What if the company doesn't do well and gets sold, etc.? What if I'm unhappy in this new position? I don't want to change jobs too quickly because it doesn't look good on a resume to leave jobs before the year mark. Leaving current company after only being here for 9 months due to how burnt out I feel here. I'm looking for lower stress in my life since I spend so much time at work. Trying to find somewhere with better processes and a non-toxic working environment so I don't leave work everyday burnt out dreading the next day. I'm also trying to constantly find pay increases in my salary due to fear of inflation. Recently I took on all of my bills that I need to live with no safety net, realizing that I'm 100% financially responsible for myself makes me nervous. I know I can do it though.

Long story short: my relationship with my parents, especially my mother, has always been a complete shitshow and I could never figure out what it was. I realize now that she fits the description almost exactly for a codependent. Rather than this turning me codependent, it has turned me \u201ctoo independent\u201d\u2014 i absolutely freak out at the idea of anyone controlling me, manipulating me, or asking me to compromise in any form. I see it as an attack on my individuality and freedom. This extreme tendency has led me to have commitment issues in romantic relationships and fear of intimacy. I still also have an unhealthy relationship with my mother where she tries to insert herself in my life, micro manage or \u201cmother \u201c me, which I respond to with refusal and argument at every turn. It has led to us having constant fights my ENTIRE life bc I will never EVER let her consume me completely. I have given years and years of my life since I was a child to her and her tendencies. These fights have gotten worse ever since I moved out in college, grad school, and now that I have a new apartment. She\u2019ll try to come bc she\u2019s attached, but she\u2019ll also try to barge in or stay longer when her relationship with my father is not going well. This interferes with my life and my job! I feel like the state of their marriage determines the state of my sanity\u2026so I constantly feel insane \ud83e\udd13 I do believe a large part of this is my father\u2019s fault as well, but don\u2019t get me started on that. \n\nAt the age of 26, i feel 80. I feel like I\u2019m the mother to a needy child (my own mother) who has become impossible to placate. I\u2019m so extremely patient with her until she breaks me down, so I am leaving my angry rant for Reddit. What do i read? Where do i start? After 20+ years of suffering, i am at the end of my rope. All i want is peace. I gave up on her being a mother a long time ago. I\u2019m just tired of being her mother, marriage counselor, therapist, and her physical and emotional caretaker, all while being guilted, tortured, and gaslit. Sometimes she acknowledges that she\u2019s acting like a baby and just pretends that it\u2019s cute, to guilt me into allowing her to do what it is she wants at that given time. I can\u2019t take it anymore. \n\nI don\u2019t want to get married or have kids and subject them to my mother\u2019s behaviors. Or my father\u2019s outbursts of wrath. Enough is enough, I need to fix this bc no one, not my mother nor my father, will.\n\nOn another note, for those of you who grew up with a codependent parent: how do you forgive your parent and mourn the loss of your childhood and younger years? I was always a \u201clittle professor\u201d or \u201coddly patient\u201d as people describe me. They think it\u2019s bc I was raised well. But I know the truth: it\u2019s bc I had to be the \u201cmature\u201d emotional rock of the family. \n\nIf I didn\u2019t, my mother wouldn\u2019t wake up in the morning and function or would cry for hours and days, and my father would physically hurt us, trash the house, and wake up the neighbors. I had to be the one to mediate. I had to be the one to insert myself between them so someone wouldn\u2019t hit someone or choke someone. I often ended up angry, on edge, and choked\/hit\/insulted as a result. I had to cover up bruises on my face, neck, hands sometimes with foundation when I went to school so my boyfriends and friends wouldn\u2019t see and know the truth. I have always felt like the protector of a house on fire. \n\nIt has turned me emotionally into a steel tempered woman in real life, but it has left me with residual anger and sadness for the life and childhood i never had. I am envious of people who got to have their childhood and their carefree teens and twenties. I\u2019m about to be 27. It\u2019s too late for me, and it hurts so bad. I don\u2019t know how to move on from that feeling of loss.

At first it was short, terse responses that I guess were meant to end the conversation...so I gave him space. I texted him on holidays. I had a nightmare last night that something awful happened to him and I just couldn't find peace without knowing he was actually okay. \n\nKnowing he's alive and able to see messages makes me feel both better and worse. He hasn't blocked my phone number, I think. It rang. I was seriously concerned that maybe something bad had actually happened to him, but he seems okay? Our mutual friend said he was his nice helpful self. \n\nMy C-PTSD is running rampant in my mind now. Intellectually I realize that something has to be going on in M's life for him to ignore me (but not block my number). It's not about me. I still have this panic screaming \"Why does everyone leave you? What did you do?\" And it's very difficult to live with right now. After both parents abandoned me, my sister didn't talk to me for years (unrelated mental health issues of hers that have been addressed), my grief counselor died, and a previous boyfriend stole all my belongings and kicked me out....it makes you wonder wtf everyone hates about you and thus M ignoring me must be caused by this defect.\n\nI don't know how to live with this grief. That's what it feels like. This is like when my mom died.

My sister is 31 and from her first marriage, I\u2019m 21 and my partner is 22. I also still live with my parents because I\u2019m a full time student right now. \nWe were expecting this to be a lighthearted outing considering the fact that she gave absolutely no advance warning but then during the middle of it she quieted us down and told us that she had something to say. She looked me in the eyes and asked if I know she loves me. I was thinking she had cancer, then she told me that she\u2019s leaving my father and hasnt been happy for years and is happy now for the first time in so long. She also said that he doesn\u2019t fucking know yet. Naturally I didn\u2019t exactly take this well, despite their relationship having been rocky for years I thought it was getting better. And she said that she invited my partner there so I could have a support and I just went limp and hid my head behind his back to cry. My sister was trying to console me saying that if I needed to talk I could talk to her (she already knew all of this was going to happen) and I just told her to get off of me. My mom said sorry and that she wanted us to be able to stay and enjoy our drinks and have a fun time and at that point I finished crying and was just angry and took my partner and left. Immediately I started to panic because if they sell the house my own life would be turned even more upside down and I\u2019d have to quite my current drop to find one to actually afford to support myself and everything else and it\u2019s just be a mess. Incredibly selfish, I know. \nAnyway, I\u2019m also fucking stressed because she has yet to tell my father and he\u2019s not in town. He\u2019s visiting his mother who has terminal cancer. I get that this is her choice and whatever else but fucking I don\u2019t understand why she had to tell me FIRST?

I\u2019m incredibly lucky that my partner is letting my stay with him otherwise I would be so much worse off. I\u2019m so goddamn conflicted because she said not to say anything to him about it and that she\u2019d tal to him when he gets back but how dare she tell me and expect me to just live with this until Tuesday??

What do I do?? I feel like I should tell him or warn him or something but not only will my mother get upset but he\u2019s several states away and getting told by his hysterical daughter that his wife is going to leave him isn\u2019t exactly super helpful when he\u2019s so far away and can do nothing about the situation because he mind is apparently already made up !75 if I don\u2019t tell him when he gets back or gets in my car that night I\u2019m going to explode and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to keep it in and I\u2019ll feel incredibly guilty for not telling him because I feel like he has a right too know considering this is his marriage and I\u2019m so goddamn passed at my mom for dropped this shit on me and my partner first and the fact that she invited him there at all is just so uncool and ridiculous and selfish of her to a subject him to that level of torment like yes we\u2019ve been dating nearly two years but still this is an INCREDIBLY Private matter. \nPlease help me.

Usually a weekend at an amusement park or a few days at the beach, both within a few hours of home. I know it's a privilege to have yearly trips. Especially now as an adult, 27, not having to pay my way. So I don't know how to tell my parents I won't be going this year. Since it's just my parents and I, there's never been serious talk of someone not going. I've already hinted all this with my mother and she's brushed it off saying that I would be going with them.\n\nSeveral family members are immunocompromised. That includes my father, and my grandfather (who my mother is a caregiver for). I'm the only family member who's taken precautions during all of this. I wear a mask everywhere, avoid crowds, skip church, and don't eat at restaurants anymore. The rest of the family ditched all that a year ago. They think this is all over, despite a number of them getting sick. \n\nI personally don't want to risk my health to go on a trip. I've already tried easing my parents into taking some easy precautions, such as getting takeout and going somewhere less crowded. This year, my father decided himself that we will be going to the most crowded beach nearby, on the busiest weekend of the summer, and that we will be eating inside every restaurant for every meal. He's not even joking and is unwilling to compromise. \n\nAnd, to be honest, I've been looking for an excuse for years to not go. I haven't enjoyed a vacation since I was a child, and regard it as one of the most stressful times of the year. My father is anger incarnate and has a hair trigger temper. He is \"king baby\" and must be pacified at all times. Nothing can ever be his fault or just no one's fault in general, somehow, I'm always at fault. He'll scream if his coffee isn't hot enough, the food doesn't come out immediately, if the restaurant is a right turn but he wants to turn left, etc. There's just no making him happy, no matter how much we try or don't try. \n\nThey're already talking about making plans and reservations, so I know I can't wait. I know I won't be giving in. I also know they won't compromise. When I tell them I'm not going, what they'll hear is \"I'm banning you both from going anywhere and doing anything at all for all eternity\". Like most things in the past, they'll likely try pressuring and bulling me into going.

TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n\n\nLet me put up some context for you:\n\n\n\nBack when I was a senior, I got into a relationship with a girl I was neighbors with. Things went well, I honestly think it was the happiest I ever was; we dated for 2 years and a bit more before breaking up because I had to move away from home for college. At the same time things got rough, to say the least, inside of my family due to my parents separating and so on.\n\nCollege was hard for me, with everything going I developed depression and it happened that I externalized it by drinking till blacking out every week, self harming and getting laid with basically everyone and anyone that wanted to. Eventually as things settled at home and I approached the end of my bachelor's degree I managed to pull myself together through therapy and support groups. I graduated and landed a scholarship for a master's degree overseas and a job to support myself.\n\nAt this point (m24), a few months after moving, I got lucky and due to sheer luck I found the same girl from high school, who happened to have picked a field similar to mine and moved to the same country as I did. As one thing led to another we have been dating ever since.\n\n\n\nHere is where the problem lies:\n\nEven though we lost contact during my college years, she knows most of what I did thanks to mutual friends. Normally this wouldn't be a big problem but every time we have had a disagreement or issue her mind goes back to that phase of my life. I even tried to fill her in on what really happened so nothing was left to overthinking or speculation, yet still on the slightest mess up or if I'm referring to something that happened during that period in order to explain why I know a person or an event, she goes back to that. Worse yet is that even after talking through some of those occasions through we don't seem to move past them.\n\nMom, Dad, I'm not going to lie, she is the one. I write this beside her while she sleeps. There have been talks about marriage between us and we both favor the idea, but I really don't want to enter a marriage with issues that haven't had closure. I know eventually everyone has ups and downs in their relationship but I need to get rid of this pile of shit that is my past so that I can open a new chapter of my life.\n\nTL;DR: I (m26) got back together with my gf (f24) from high school after finding each other overseas. Even though we lost contact after high school she knows the messed up things I did in college and every time we have an issue she compares my behavior to that of my past self. We could be settled down soon but before that I need that we, as a couple, give closure to my past so that we can start on a clean slate.\n\nAny advice on how to really solve things for good?","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1674955640.0},{"title":"feeling useless after first day of work :(","author":"uhmthinking","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/10nqb25\/feeling_useless_after_first_day_of_work\/","text":"really need some advice or reassurance rn\n\nSo I had my first day at work today, it\u2019s an on-campus job at the auditorium and I\u2019m working as a stage hand. today was cue setting and I felt so useless there\u2014for the most part I was just sitting around waiting for little tasks like \u201cunplug this light and move it here\u201d \u201cput this tape away.\u201d I modeled for the person light designing for a bit which is the most useful thing I did lol.

I wanted him to go climbing with me for a while now. I used to go when I was a kid but stopped because of health problems, and then when he was older he started going and still goes with his friends. I recently got back into it because my problems have subsided to a point where I'm able to, and I managed to convince a friend to go with me occasionally, but our schedules don't match up often enough to go as frequently as I want to (I'm pretty out of shape and want to get a bit fitter so I don't die lol). \n\n So I've been trying to convince my brother to go with me, partly for pragmatic reasons (we both like climbing, we both still live at home, we get on well enough that we've never had a serious fight before, just typical sibling disagreements and rivalry), and partly because I like doing things with people that I care about and I want to spend time with him. But he's been adamant that he doesn't want to go with me and refuses to explain why beyond the fact that I'm his sister. \n\n I figured it was probably a smidge of insecurity on his part and his typical unwillingness to try new things without being pressured into it a little bit. So, when I did a favour for him (one of many, might I add), we both agreed that he owed me one, and I asked that in return, he should go climbing with me for the same amount of time I spent doing the favour for him (~an hour and a half). He agreed even if he was reluctant, but I was pretty reluctant to do the favour for him because I was exhausted at the time and it was a pretty huge inconvenience, so it seemed fair to me to ask for something he was reluctant to do in return. \n\nSo, yesterday, he agreed to go with me, and ended up having a nap instead even though I'd been looking forward to it all day. We rearranged to go today instead, and we ended up arguing all the way there, with him ultimately saying he would go into the building with me, but refusing to actually climb *with* me (e.g. belaying and going around together) and saying he was just going to go bouldering on his own and ignore me the whole time. I'm not good at bouldering, I don't enjoy bouldering, and besides that, I get quite anxious in the climbing centre because there can definitely be a bit of a 'bro-ish' vibe that puts me on edge and I didn't want to just go on my own (I want to work up to it one day, but not yet!). \n\n That proposed arrangement made me feel extremely anxious, and also it seemed like he was going back on the whole deal we had, so I said I'd rather just go home and not go if he was going to be like that. So we went home, and that ended up just confirming all the things I'd been worried about. I tried to explain to him that him refusing to do just one thing that would mean a huge amount to me made it feel like he didn't love me very much (I know that sounds dramatic - but doing things for people that aren't necessarily *fun* has always seemed to me like a pretty standard way to show someone you care about them), and I pretty much begged him to explain *why* he was so adamant about not going with me, and he just yelled that he doesn't want to go climbing with his sister - which isn't much of an explanation, he's perfectly happy to do other things with me, and he refused to admit that it had anything to do with being insecure about it. \n\nSo I got extremely mad at him. He knew how much it meant to me. If something meant that much to him I would go along with it in a heartbeat, even if it *wasn't* something I already regularly did with other people! It felt like he just didn't care about me and was unwilling to communicate on the issue or compromise. So I haven't talked to him all evening, and am currently refusing to do so until he apologises, if for nothing other than promising to do something then breaking that promise. \n\n I feel extremely hurt by the whole thing and rejected, it feels like I'm constantly going out of my way to be a good sister to him, but he isn't doing the same in return. I'm terrified though that this is going to impact our relationship in the long run or expose fissures that were already there. I don't know how to handle this conflict when he won't even try to work with me. I just want him to do *something* to demonstrate that he cares about me more than he cares about looking cool or whatever his issue is - I don't even know because he won't communicate with me. More than that, I want us to be okay in the long run. I love him, and I'm scared of losing him when he goes to uni next year and we don't have physical proximity keeping us close. I don't know what to do to fix this, I don't know what to do to get my brother to want to fix it too. It seems like a stupid thing to argue about, but I've never felt this deeply hurt over something he's done before.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674701970.0},{"title":"Elderly father is delirious after his hospitalization.","author":"workinfast1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/10lbxzu\/elderly_father_is_delirious_after_his\/","text":"Hello.

So this literally just happened, and I have no idea what to do. I moved to my new high school last year, and on the first day I met Chloe. We connected instantly from shared passions, and we started talking. We both do theater together, and we were in the fall show. One day we were talking, the next she stopped responding. I noticed that she started to walk past me in the hallways without saying hello, and she was ghosting me over text. This happened out of nowhere. I sent her another message asking if we were okay, and she send a long text back. This message detailed that she has felt guilty for things she shouldn't have to, and that I \"say things that pick at my insecurities\". She concluded the message by saying \"I can't stay in a friendship that is affecting me mentally and I don't feel like I'm in a place to be friends like we have in the past.\" I was completely, and am, shocked. Over 18 month friendship we had, she never once said a thing to me about being hurt by my words. I never got an indication, and she never once communicated with me. I sent a message back around the lines of \"Hey, I'm sorry this is happening. Can you please tell me what I did\/when did this start?\" Apparently this has been happening since Last January, and she never mentioned it to me. When she got into last years show and I didn't, I apparently made her feel guilty about getting in and she couldn't enjoy the show. She stated that when she was trying to cheer me up about it, she left feeling guilty. She also mentioned she wanted to let me down easy and gradually stop talking. Without telling me, at all. I was really, really, hurt by this. I apologized for causing her to feel upset, but I don't think it's my fault that she never once told me she was feeling this was. She allowed it to fester, and she just decided to ghost me one day. I'm so upset about this, I'm losing someone I knew for so long, just out of the blue. One day we were fine, the next we aren't friends anymore. I don't want to be angry at her, but I can't help but be. We could have fixed things if she just told me. Instead, she is blaming me entirely for the end of our friendship, and that I am completely insensitive (she said that it is her fault that she didn't communicate, but then proceeded to blame me again). I don't know what to do, at all. I am starting a play with her, and now I can't talk to her or her friends (which were also mine).

I (25f) feel very hopeless about the future, particularly my ability to find a good job. I currently work in the service industry. The only other experience I have is a small handful of internships at different non-profits over the years, but nothing that could lead to a job I think. I really have no career path and am totally directionless. I do have my bachelor's but just in name, I don't have any particular field or much applicable experience or networks.\n\nI don't think I've ever not been struggling. Even when I get into jobs, I lose my steam eventually and don't enjoy it. I feel that even if I am qualified for jobs, I expect to lose the opportunity because I struggle to connect with people. I get very anxious for interviews. I also have social anxiety, as may be evident, though I am working on it.\n\nIn general, my struggle to connect with people leaves me feeling lonely and puts me at a disadvantage I think. I haven't really accumulated the knowledge about working professionally that I should have by now. As I said, I just have a service industry job. The job doesn't really lead anywhere (don't really want to stay in service anyway) and I don't know where to go from here.\n\nI'm also lonely. I don't make friends well. I think really poorly of myself and I think that affects my ability to maintain relationships a lot. I find it very taxing. Ofc I also don't date or anything. My social circle doesn't extend past my old friends and my job.\n\nI feel hopeless and don't want to put effort in. Especially because I am living at home comfortably (which I am grateful for, but it means I won't push myself in the way I should be). I just look into the future and I see nothing for myself. I'm okay right now, at least I'm working, but... everything just seems too hard and overwhelming. And the future of the world doesn't seem very bright either. I am also depressed and I need to get back in treatment for it, but I don't think I'll ever not be depressed (I'm also going to lose my mom's insurance in a year, so less likely to get treatment anyway). So even if this pessimism is due to depression, I have to function regardless bc it won't go away.\n\nI'm just really lacking direction and hope and don't know where to find it.

She apologized, then a month later she gave me unsolicited advice on how to better round myself as a person as he felt that I \"lacked character growth,\" because I don't have too many hobbies\/conversation starters besides work, school, and friends. Again, she apologized because she meant that she felt that I could benefit from the advice and maybe take this chance to venture into new hobbies that I would have never tried before.\n\nWhat really set it off was a few days ago, she mentioned that he feels immensely guilty over not being so tunnel-visioned for me and having crushes\/attractions to other women that she would find hard not to resist. She told me she would always choose me but her mind would often wander and sometimes she'd feel tempted.

We've all been there. Probably somewhere around high school: You're stuck in a group where no one else is taking it seriously or is as competent and it makes you want to scream.  The difference with this is that it's my job *and it's really friggen important*.\n\nBackground: I'm a community health worker. I've also worked in commercial kitchens, including a hospital dietetics program. I'm fairly knowledgeable about food and nutrition, but I am in *no way* an expert.\n\nI work for a nonprofit that has a program aimed at reducing food insecurity and increasing nutritional awareness.  I and two other coworkers expressed interest in getting more involved in this program.  I have always been skeptical about the expertise that one of them claims to have because I have seen how she eats, but I figured maybe it's just a case of \"do as I say, not as I do\". \n\nAnyway, the three of us were pulled together and given extremely short notice on a presentation that the director wants us to put together.  We had less than two weeks and will be expected to put together multiple of these in the future.\n\nWe sat down and tried to brainstorm, but issues became immediately apparent.  I had to step in frequently to get things back on track, to narrow our scope, and to basically do all of the structure. I don't mind doing this because it's a skill that I have and I was able to take their good ideas and fit them into what we needed.\n\nThe main issue is that I found out neither one of them knows how to cook.  Neither one of them knows very much about nutrition (the vegan is better about this than the third person).  The omnivore says she has worked in kitchens before, but it's clear that it was something that everything was prepackaged, premeasured, and on an assembly line.\n\nShe does not know how to measure.  She doesn't know what a cup is.  Her meal ideas are nutritionally incomplete and focused around unhealthy volumes of meat (i.e. more than 2\/3 of the calories in a meal are from fatty meats, mostly pork and fried chicken). \n\nThe vegan admitted that most of his meals are vegetables that he adds to microwaved meals. \n\nNow, I am not the food police.  Eat whatever the hell you want, however the hell you want.  I'm also not some kind of food saint who never eats anything I shouldn't.  However, we have been tasked with each coming up with a clear recipe that will guide people through saving money, learning about how to use seasonal vegetables, and eating more healthily.\n\nThe two of them are not qualified to do so.  I like both of them just fine and they have some great ideas, but they do not belong in this department.\n\nI gave them a deadline to get me their basic ingredients, rough instructions, and a picture of the finished product. I told them I would write their recipe out for them and make them a nutrition facts table for it.  They have not gotten me anything.  Neither one of them are reachable on Slack. We have our final meeting on the project tomorrow and I'm trying to calm my tits about it.\n\nWhat's worse is that, because of her insisting on her expertise, the least qualified person *has been tapped to lead the program department*. \n\nThis is something that is important to me and I'm freaking out internally. I do not want to take on *another* department (I lead the community health education program), but I am literally the most qualified person in the organization. I don't even know how I would approach my boss about any of this.  I am deeply concerned about harmful information being taught to a vulnerable population.\n\nI know that I cannot control other people (despite the insistence of my autism) and that I can't do *everything* (despite the insistence of my anxiety), but this is something I can't just ignore while she leads classes telling people: \"Get 5 lbs of pork ribs, about *this much* butter, about two fists of boxed mashed potatoes\" etc, etc. \n\nHelp!","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1674493594.0},{"title":"Moving states","author":"Synth1337","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/10jiq03\/moving_states\/","text":"So I moved states a few days ago and I have to get my license both renewed and the address on my license changed.

And what do I do?\n\nTL;DR - my parents always nag me and cause me great stress because of this so I actively try to avoid them my working the night shift at my job, staying up until early in the morning then sleeping all day.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674479832.0},{"title":"How do I deal with this tricky situation at work?","author":"Particular-Bat-8286","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/10j64b6\/how_do_i_deal_with_this_tricky_situation_at_work\/","text":"So I've just joined this company for about three months with another new hire, but it's been a very difficult few months. \n\nThings started a few months ago when I got given one of the hardest jobs to do in the whole team. \n\nI was given this just when people were going for year-end holidays, so they were rushing through the tutorials. There weren't even clear instructions written in the task. Most of the instructions in the task were plain wrong. \n\nWhen I did ask for clarification, I was told by the seniors to ask the boss. So I did. \n\nThey then got upset that I asked the boss since it reflected badly on them, and have been even more hostile since. \n\nAfter that, when I've asked for clarification, I've been told that things are self explanatory. When I asked the boss about it, she took half an hour to explain. Clearly, it was anything but self explanatory. \n\nAfter this happened, I've been taking the last two months quietly trying to figure things out on my own and been successful. From taking 9 hours to do the task, I did it in 6 and now 3. Basically, I'm working at 3x speed and believed everything was going well. \n\nA couple weeks ago, one morning I came into work after dealing with family and personal issues and wasn't talking too much since I was trying to focus on work to get everything done. I was talking, just not more than necessary since I was trying to focus on work. \n\nI didn't want to give them another excuse to criticise me for not doing work properly and so on. \n\nAt lunchtime, the other new hire then complained to me that I was clear I wasn't happy at work and it was affecting team morale. \n\nI was upset by this since I had already done everything they asked for up to that point. As far as I was concerned, I wasn't even retaliating to their snarky comments. I was simply keeping to myself. Yet it was a problem. \n\nWhen I explained I was dealing with more than work at the moment and that I was not angry at my colleagues, i was then told that I shouldn't let other things affect my work. \n\nI got slightly annoyed at this point as I WAS doing my work, on time and relatively mistake-free just as they wanted. So how was my work affected?\n\nAfter saying this, I told the other new hire that I didn't want to talk about this anymore. \n\nThis week, that senior began trying to instigate problems again by highlighting my work mistakes in the group chat. Yet when I asked for help, silence ensued until the boss stepped in and told someone else to help me. \n\nI'm getting properly sick of this passive aggressiveness and unconstructive criticism. Given that I have to stay in this job for a bit more than half a year, how should I deal with this? It feels like no matter what I do, someone seems to criticise it.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1674456318.0},{"title":"Taxes, tolls, registration, license\u2014which do I have to pay first?","author":"CategoryFearless4257","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/internetparents\/comments\/10iwzpz\/taxes_tolls_registration_licensewhich_do_i_have\/","text":"SUMMARY: \n\nI have 2 years of unpaid taxes, I have unpaid toll road bills, an expired vehicle registration, and an expired license.\n\nWhy: poverty due to mental disorder symptoms.\n\nI need to know what to do in what order in the most economical way\n\nFACTORS:\n\n-I have reasonable need to have use of my car, so the car-related tasks\/obligations are seemingly most urgent.\n\n-I currently have little $$$ and make little $$$.\n\nQUESTION:\n\nIs there an order of operations for how I should handle these things and am I able to utilize monthly payment plans?\n\nFor example\n\nToll road bills (monthly payment plan)-> Taxes (monthly payment plan) -\u00bb Registration (vehicle inspection and those related expenses first) -> License renewal\n\nLike, is it a legal requirement that I have my car Registered before I can renew my License?
