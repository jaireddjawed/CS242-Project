With this in knowledge, I ask, why do we not reforest the land? From my time living around the area and speaking to its inhabitants I found out that the land, (in the words of a couple farmers who own land there) is pretty much worthless and only good for sheep grazing (partially due to legal reasons, and partially due to environmental factors)\n\n\nSo if the land is left un-managed it could turn back to forests, so why don't we just reforest the land? To my knowledge it would make so much more sense, both financially and environmentally, surely the potential income for future generations from logging outweighs the small profit possible from grazing a small amount of sheep? Combined with potentially huge new areas of natural land, increases in wildlife populations ,potential for reintroduction of lost species not plausible with our current lack of natural land to sustain populations of things like the Lynx, wolves and boars.\n\n\nThen there is the global benefit of carbon capture, climate stabilisation, soil strengthening so that the land can become more fertile for potential future farming. Along with simply making new large areas of nature currently not available in the UK for wilderness activities like treks, wild camping, hunting etc. The Re-wilding of Britain seems like a popular idea, everyone I have spoken to about this seems to be in support of it, even the government seems to be in support of it with projects like the national Forest and that new forest wall in England that they want to create.\n\n\nWhat am I missing?

But what determines an inertial reference frame?\n\nDo inertial reference frames depend on the existence of lots of matter out in the universe \"holding steady\"? For example, if there were only two particles in the universe and those particles played out a scenario similar to the twin-paradox scenario, would there still be a meaningful difference between the frames of reference?",

        "text": "Here is text from the website of Alley Cat Allies, a prominent cat protection group.\n\n&gt; It is a fact that the removal and killing of outdoor cats that animal control has been pursuing for decades is never ending and futile....Each time cats are removed, the population will rebound through a natural phenomenon known as the “vacuum effect,” drawing the community into a costly, endless cycle of trapping and killing.\n\n&gt;The vacuum effect is a phenomenon scientifically recognized worldwide, across all types of animal species\n\n&gt;Well-documented among biologists, the vacuum effect describes what happens when even a portion of an animal population is permanently removed from its home range. Sooner or later, the empty habitat attracts other members of the species from neighboring areas, who move in to take advantage of the same resources that attracted the first group (like shelter and food). Killing or removing the original population...only creates a “vacuum”....\n\nhttps://www.alleycat.org/resources/the-vacuum-effect-why-catch-and-kill-doesnt-work/\n\n- - - -\n\nEntirely true. But the difference is that TNR people are *feeding* the released cats. TNR cats are not competing with feral (non-TNR) cats for food in the natural environment; indeed the non-TNR cats are now raiding the food sites, with the potential that the ferals might breed even faster. \n\n*Discussion might touch on the efficacy of culling.*  Lately some environmental groups have tried to discredit the principle of culling, noting, for example, how difficult it is to cull coyotes, which reproduce rapidly.  Entirely true.  \n\nQuote from Alley Cats:  \"But scientific research, years of failed attempts, and evidence from animal control personnel prove that catch and kill doesn’t permanently clear an area of cats.\n\nCulling is a suppression effort, not an eradication effort. (Those are much more difficult; New Zealand and Australia are now attempting pest eradication on some islands.)  \n\nCulling never stops (though it can be applied highly intermittently).  Humans have been culling rats for thousands of years.  Yes culling can be expensive to administer.  Nature of the thing. ",

        "text": "It is my understanding that hydrogen basically serves as a liquid battery. It is (or could be) generated by using electricity for the electrolysis of water, while it releases energy by 'burning' it in a fuel cell. The main issue seems to be the low density of hydrogen. It requires enormous pressures to be stored, while even then, it still doesn't contain that much energy by volume.\n\nA quick search on wolfram alpha reveals that the density of hydrogen with a pressure of 70 MPa and a temperature of 293 K is roughly 40 kg/m3. This multiplied by the energy content of hydrogen of 142 MJ/kg results in an energy density of 5.7 GJ/m3.\n\nThe density of methane at the same pressure and temperature is 312 kg/m3, while the energy content is a little bit lower at 142 MJ/kg, but this still results in an energy density of 17.3 GJ/m3. The same calculations for propane result in an even higher number, 29.6 GJ/m3.\n\nIn other words, a fuel tank filled with methane contains 3 times as much energy as a hydrogen tank, while a tank filled with propane contains over 5 times as much energy.\n\nThis begs the question, why focus so much on hydrogen fuel when methane and propane contain so much more energy and seem much more suitable?\n\n**For clarity, I am talking about synthesizing fuels and using fuel cells to burn them, resulting in no netto emissions.**",
