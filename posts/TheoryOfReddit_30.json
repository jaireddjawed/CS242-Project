This is not a theory. Shilling is an openly stated fact. \n\n**There are a few reasons why people are ignorant on this topic**. Three reasons I can think of are 1) Reddit moderators like to censor this information and 2) this information is locked up behind a lot of search terms that are not well-known, which means that a curious person will not easily find the information that they seek by using google, unless they are aware of all of the terminology of this trade. Finally, 3) Reddit's vote counter on the side of posts is an inaccurate representation of the amount of people who view a post. Reddit reaches many, many millions of people. An imgur image that was just uploaded can hit a million views on Reddit after 4 hours or so. You can verify this by looking at the view counter on an imgur image and the date it was uploaded. [Reddit is the 9th largest website in the US](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com) and ranked 27th in the entire world. *Of course* there will be shills here. \n\n**Terms to search for**: Social media marketing or manipulation, astroturfing, shilling, reputation management, public relations, paid trolls, paid posts, fake reviews, crisis management, political bots. I've done the bulk of the work for you in the aforementioned link [Astroturfing Information Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/). \n\n**Is it worth the money?** As I said, this is the 9th largest site in the US. This site is one of the best ways to target younger people with advertising and propaganda, especially because the younger crowd is shifting away from television ads. \n\nA random billboard I found gets 30-60 thousand views a day and costs about [15,000 dollars a month.](http://www.imaoutdoor.com/content/view/17/33/) Reddit's front page draws between 100,000 and a million views per post per day. A shill at 15/hr at 8hr/day would cost 2400 a month. Also keep in mind that shills can erect a hundred \"billboards\" on Reddit during an 8 hour shift. \n\nCompared to billboards, a shill is a fraction of the cost, can advertise way more content per day, and people actually read the posts. Many people are used to billboards and don't pay them much attention. ",

Most articles on the front page aren't really about either of them at all.\n\nDo you think there's any truth to this rather subjective claim?  Any way to prove or measure if it actually has any credence?  If so, do you think it actually has anything to do with his digital team (or, very recently, his lack thereof)?  Some contend that this is why articles that were actually against Sanders could be upvoted greatly by taking quotes of context to look as if they were supportive: the program only looked to the title.\n\nIt's all very interesting to me because maybe it had to do with the tragedy in Orlando or the drubbing in Washington DC, but I'm not really sure it did.",

Half an hour to an hour, if even that long. Now, I am lucky if I find out about something within five hours, or longer, if I am using reddit as my primary news feed. To me this is unacceptable and is in direct opposition to the reasons I started browsing reddit in the first place. \n\nIn my personal life I went from informing the people around me of stuff that is happening to them informing me and seeing it on reddit, finally, a few hours later. I'm only pointing this out as a benchmark. \n\nAround the time of the mass subreddit bans, maybe right before this time, I had started to notice this change. I'm not sure if it was some kind of change in algorithm or code or what, but it absolutely needs to be corrected/changed back. \n\nOn that note, moderator interference has gotten ridiculous. Removal of threads and comments and bans and shadow bans. This all contributes to the problem, and this debacle with /r/news proves it. The moderators need to step back and let the users moderate the subs. That is the entire reason the up and down vote arrows exist. If you have a subscriber base in a sub that wants to talk about something, then let them! The votes used to speak for themselves, now they don't, now we have problems. \n\nTL:DR-  change whatever you need to change to make sure the front page is fluid and acceptably updated, force mods to step back and be mods of technical problems and flagrant site abuse and let the users moderate themselves, stop with this quarantine nonsense unless the shit posted in those subreddits is actually against the law, and let's make reddit great again. \n\nEdit: Also, get rid of this automatic downvote crap. Let the user up and downvote.",

A vocal minority is quite obviously able to spam the front page with enough voter participation.\n\nWhat if we were to change the /r/all algorithm to weigh votes from non-subscribers more heavily? Perhaps it wouldn't affect the actual vote count, but maybe it would affect the \"/r/all score\" more heavily, for lack of a better term. So if the majority of users who are not subscribed to a subreddit (innocent bystanders) dislike certain posts, then they are much less likely to hit /r/all.\n\nThis allows very vocal \"special interest\" subs to remain active, but prevent them from dominating /r/all when public sentiment generally disagrees.\n\n**This would:**\n\n* Allow \"fringe\" communities to continue to exist as they do now, and to continue to cater to their own audience\n* Prevent said fringe communities from gaming the system and subjecting the majority to their unpopular opinions\n\n**Potential problem:**\n\n* Users could use alternate accounts that are not subscribed to the special interest subs to continue to manipulate the votes. Not sure how to handle this.\n\nAny thoughts? I feel like it's a pretty good compromise and should prevent small, vocal sectors of reddit from dominating the discussion.",

I am almost certain that at least one of the two new news subreddits I listed will become very right-slanted (not necessarily bad) and extreme (probably bad), as most people forget about or more likely become apathetic and dismiss the whole drama and migrate back to /r/news.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI mean, already on uncensored news: \n[It's Muslim law to kill homosexuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/4nvag7/killing_homosexuals_is_not_isis_law_it_is_muslim/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd Full news putting up [the full mod list of /r/news ~ to presumably start a which hunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Full_news/comments/4nqzfp/the_full_list_of_mods_at_rnews/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlthough both subs contain people trying to avoid turning into a very unbalanced news space, I think after this whole thing blows over, only extremely opinionated will remain in the sub, creating a hivemind. /r/news will return to its former strength, primarily due to already having the most people posting a variety of news so their is at least some semblance of balance. And I think for most of the reddit population that didn't really get too involved in this whole drama, they are aware that /r/news much like /r/politics has a slant in what gets upvoted. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen this whole thing blows over, I am almost certain that it will, it'll be another chapter for /r/museumofreddit.

The top comments indicate that the breaking news thread on this topic in the r/news sub-reddit had some problems: the mods removed many, many comments in that thread. Many users claimed that posts that were not anti-Muslim (e.g., comments linking to blood donation sites) were removed. I'm really not sure of all the details of this (how, exactly, was it decided to move the \"breaking news\" discussion to r/Askreddit? Was this a top-down decision? A collective decision?), but it got me thinking about the unique character of discussions of breaking news that involve some politicized element (e.g., Islamic extremism). \n\nWhat would you say is the point of those threads? Do they do more good than harm? Do you see a trend in the balance between negativity (e.g., hate speech) and positivity (expressions of support, accurate information) over time or between sub-reddits? I'm largely ignorant of this aspect of reddit, as I use it more for looking at funny gifs and discussing movies and science and not as a source for news.  ",

It's surprising that she managed to get her exact name.

I asked a followup question to get more information and got a very general response. I then asked another followup question and got nothing. Shortly thereafter, not having received any other attention, the author deleted the post. It smelled fishy so I checked the author's history and he/she has a history of posting antagonistic comments. I suspect the author wanted to raise hackles.\n\nMy line of questioning was intended to lead the author to the line of reasoning I had in mind via the Socratic method. Use of the method has the side benefit of deferring the need to write a lot, while also allowing me to collect information to better understand what the author's position is so the discussion can be more fruitful. But until today I hadn't considered that it could also frustrate someone who was looking to pick a fight, with very little effort expended. Even better, it also improves legitimate discussions: A win-win that elevates honest threads while at the same time not feeding the trolls.\n\nI can link the thread, but there isn't much there.
