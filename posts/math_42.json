I did courses in general topology, metric and normed spaces, but the different proofs of Borsuk-Ulam theorem seem to be quite challenging.\nDifferent proofs seem to take different approaches, and I do not know which one to follow.\n\nSo, if anyone could recommend which proof of Borsuk-Ulam to stick with (or which one do you like the most), I would be really thankful. I am also thankful for any advices/comments/hints about the theorem. It maybe should be mentioned that I will have about a month to study the theorem and all the background I need for the proof, so I'm not even sure if it doable.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "As an older student who returned to college later in life, I was determined to succeed in Calculus. However, my journey has not been without its challenges. After withdrawing from the class the first time, I went back and retook Algebra, earning an A. I then took Pre-Calculus for the first time and, despite failing the final exam, managed to earn a C in the course.\n\nI was determined to do better in Calculus this time around. But, as fate would have it, my personal life took a devastating turn. In the first week of classes, my beloved dog of 16 years passed away, leaving me reeling. Despite this setback, I persevered and continued to do my coursework.\n\nUnfortunately, I failed three exams in Calculus and struggled to keep up with the homework, despite meeting with a tutor once a week. The tutor was nice, but his method of basically doing the work for me when I got stuck, didn't help me understand the material. I let him know that I didn't feel like it was helping me.\n\nTo add insult to injury, I had trouble accessing my graded exams throughout the semester and had to repeatedly email my professor to resolve the issue. It turns out, the due date on mymathlab was set to sometime in 2023! This was yet another reason I asked to take an incomplete, as I couldn't see where I was going wrong.\n\nNow, I have a second chance to pass Calculus, but I have only three months to study for the final exam. The pressure is immense. If I don't pass this class, my financial aid won't cover me retaking it. And I still have more math classes to take as a Data Science major, with only 16 credit hours left to graduate.\n\nI'm feeling discouraged, stupid and like a failure, as this class is a stark contrast to the easy A's I received in my other courses. It's hard to refrain from comparing myself to others who seem to get A's in math without trying. But I'm determined to succeed. I've spent more than the recommended time studying and reached out for help, yet I still struggle.\n\nI'm reaching out for advice and suggestions on how to overcome this obstacle and excel in math. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What helped you?",

        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nAs the title says, I'm curious if anyone knows of any cool applications of techniques in optimal transport onto ergodic theory.  I'm coming from an optimal transport background and am hoping to give a talk to some people mainly concerned about ergodic theory, so I was hoping to find something interesting for them while also being in the realm of what I'm somewhat comfortable with. \n\nI saw this paper about ergodic transport ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.5301.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.5301.pdf)) and it got me curious of whether such applications exist. The paper itself seems to be more on the side of doing Optimal transport in an Ergodic theory setting, so I'm not so sure if this is exactly what I should be looking at, but please correct me if I'm wrong.  \n\nThank you!",

But I've come across a formula that I didn't annotate with a reference, and I can't find a google result to my query to make sure it's correct. \n\nI have a irregular quadrangle in 2D space, and I need to determine if a measured point lies inside or outside of [this quadrangle.](https://imgur.com/a/vOSLk1H) \nThe x,y coordinates of the vertices are [here.](https://imgur.com/a/sj6RI77)\n\nLet's call the line between P1 &amp; P2, L1, between P2 &amp; P3 is L2, etc.\n\nI'm treating L1 and L2 like vectors and checking to see if the point lies on the plane created by the two vectors. If it does, I get a true (1), if it doesn't I get a False (0). I repeat this for each pair of consecutive \"vectors\" on the quadrangle. If and only if at the end of my calculations I get a total of 4, the point **is** within the quadrangle. \n\nHere's [my convoluted formula](https://imgur.com/a/sj6RI77). To simplify and reword it in non Excel-ese, I'll just take the first part of the following formula (that is repeated 4 times for each pair of \"vectors\"):\n\n    SIGN((Px2-Px1)*(Y-Py1)-(Py2-P1y)*(X-Px1))\n    where (X,Y) are the coordinates for the measured point\n    where a positive value indicates that the point lies within the plane created by the two vectors\n    where a negative value indicates the point lies outside of the plane created by the two vectors\n    the SIGN surrounding the entire expression is meant to output a 1 if the parenthetical value is positive and 0 if the parenthetical value of the expression is negative.\n\n\nSo my questions are, is this the correct formula to determine if a point lies between two vectors (AKA on a plane created by the two vectors)? If so, what is the name of this formula? or Do you have a reference for this formula?\n\nTIA",

On a sphere, I can argue to myself that the circumference of such a circle drawn on the surface is less than if it were drawn on a flat surface. In my argument, I imagine the sphere with circle drawn on it shrinking with the value of R for the circle held constant. The circle is forced to shrink in circumference until it is zero for some small enough sphere. So, if I lay a \"flat\" circle on the surface of a sphere, I suppose that the circumference will be less, as the circle has begun the process of shrinking (for an infinitely large sphere, the surface will locally look flat and the circle will have the same circumference, but for finite spheres, the circumference starts to shrink as the curvature bends R on the surface, \"pulling in\" the circle towards the center on a plane some distance from that center). However, I need help understanding why the circumference for a given R would be greater on a hyperbolic (saddle-shaped, say) surface than it would be on a flat surface.",

        "text": "Let's say I have an equilateral polygon, which we'll call the parent shape for understanding. I want to connect X amount of corners together to form an X sided polygon, called the child.\n\nWhat I want to know is NOT how to calculate how many possible children can be made from connecting the parent's corners (for example, a twelve-sided equilateral polygon can make 792 seven-sided polygons from connecting it's corners). What I actually want to know is, of the possible child shapes that can be formed, how many have a unique combination of angles?\n\nFor more clarification, if I had a 12 sided parent shape, I can form 4 unique equilateral triangles as children, but I've only identified one particular shape, which the equilateral triangle, as depicted here:\n\n[Equilateral Triangles on a dodecagon](https://preview.redd.it/7iazrhyb82ba1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4021bade8cd1de1cbaa706e65e5cbe4b82f48968)\n\nI'm pretty brain dead right now and I really want to figure this out for personal edification. Help and a proof is much appreciated!",
