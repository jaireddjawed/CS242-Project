        "text": "I'd just completed a delivery in one of the further parts of our delivery area, and I noticed a cat to the side of the road in someone's driveway... as I'm sure most of us are quite used to cats' usual response to a car coming up the street it was decidedly odd the cat decided to begin approaching me as I started up the street, I steered wide around it and pulled over just past it, as the cat had turned to continue walking toward me as I passed. As soon as I hopped out the cat picked its pace up and nearly trotted to me. As with typical friendly cat behavior it did a few figure eights around my ankles, and then promptly jumped into my car and [made herself comfortable on my driver's seat](http://i.imgur.com/70t6o83.jpg). The blurred right paw being due to the fervent kneading action she was doing just after getting comfortable. She had no objections to being petted, of course, and I had the opportunity to notice some of the signs that, yes, she'd been out in the Vegas heat for a while...a bit of crustiness around the eyes, fur while groomed was a bit dirty, especially around the tail, and she had a slight wheezing in her breath. I decided there's no way I can just toss her back on the street and pick her up and plop her in the passenger seat so I can sit back down. Again, no real objections from the cat, just a mildly cold stare...standard for a cat that just got uprooted from 'their comfy spot' and nothing more. \n\n   Upon getting back to the store I got let off a little earlier than planned, cashed out, and snagged a small cup of water to take back to my SUV... upon being presented with the water she drank for a good solid minute, maybe two. I was rather surprised the little 2oz cup hadn't got licked dry after that long. I headed from there to a 24 hour vet nearby, it being about 9pm at this point and a Sunday most others were of course, closed. They scanned her and found a microchip in her neck, I'd kinda expected as much, she was way to friendly to be a random stray/feral cat. The vet called Avid, who then started trying to contact the owners. After waiting for a bit (about 30 minutes) I checked back in with the vets to see if they'd been called back, they hadn't but gave me Avid's phone number, and the microchip number so i could follow up with them. I did, and they confirmed what I'd suspected, she was indeed a lost cat. She'd been reported missing on June 24th and not been seen since, and they said they were going to try a few other methods of contacting the owners again. By this point the little sweetheart had [made herself at home on my work jacket in the back seat, and was dozing quite nicely](http://i.imgur.com/Kpn24rU.jpg). A short time later one of the owners called me to confirm what Avid told them was true... yep I had their \"extra toed kitty\" with me at the vet's parking lot still. She informed me that her husband would be right there to pick her up shortly, they lived on the very street I'd picked her up from they confirmed, so I knew the drive well. And sure enough about 15 minutes later they arrived and picked her up, groggy being woken from her nap, but looking pretty excited at the prospect of some wet food in her near future. Sure, some folks would probably scoff at the $25 the guy had quickly given me, but the way I figure it it more than covered what I'd of made in the final hour of my shift, and I'd of done it for nothing just as happily, seeing as I've got my own 'fur baby' ([obligatory cat tax of mine](http://i.imgur.com/DJR8A.jpg)) at home that I love to death.",

        "text": "A medical office put in a huge advance order for their office party. I work at a local Italian place so they ordered large trays of pasta, garlic bread, pizzas, salad trays, chicken fingers, etc etc. The bill ended up being around $900.                \n                \nWe were told was that the delivery was for 2:00pm on Friday. So, that Friday, I help my manager get all this shit together. Making salads, pouring dressings, packaging and loading $900 worth of pasta trays. My little car was completely packed with food.               \n                      \nI park and I'm just about to start bringing in the food when I get the phone call. I was a little suspicious because there were only two cars at this supposed party. \"Hey man, did you deliver the food yet? Yeah we fucked up, that order was for NEXT Friday.\"                    \n             \nLuckily a fuck up of this magnitude wasn't my fault, so even though I was annoyed about loading everything and driving it, at least they weren't mad at me.                  \n                 \nA week passes. I again find myself loading these pasta trays (the trays are like 2 feet wide and 3 feet long each) and getting the leaky alfredo all over my upholstery. Drive it over there and arrive perfectly at the requested time.                   \n                \nBoss Lady asks me to put everything on the back table, so I arrange it all nicely back there. I have her sign the prepaid receipt so there's proof of delivery. She then says that she wants to tip me 10%. I thank her profusely, and she says she wants to put it on the card.                 \n                  \nProblem: the order was already closed out at the time of payment, so I couldn't add a tip. I call up the restaurant and ask what I should do, and my manager tells me to just ring up the tip as a new transaction and have her swipe on my card reader. I explain the situation to Boss Lady, and she says she doesn't want to do that. She assures me that she'll stop by the restaurant later that night after the party and leave the tip for me there. I thank her again and take my leave.                \n                \nWith a heavy heart I drove back, knowing full well that the owner of a medical office isn't going to give a fuck enough about the pizza guy to remember to go all the way to the restaurant later to tip him. And sure enough, she never showed up that night or ever.                  \n                 \nMy manager said that she was informed at the time of purchase that she wouldn't be able to add a tip, and she said she'd just give cash. So anyway, that's how I ended up getting stiffed on a $900 order I had to deliver twice.",

        "text": "So I'm a delivery driver with a large chain. We had a torrential downpour of rain today in my city so, of course, we were insanely busy. As in so busy that I hit out on a quad, the other driver was out on a quad, and we still had roughly 20 deliveries in the store either on the hot rack, in the oven, or being made. We also had to call in an evening driver early just to make it.\n\nSo as this huge rush is finally slowing down a tiny bit, there is a mix up with deliveries. I accidentally had one of the pizzas that was for an order the other driver took. (Which wasn't really my fault since my manager just handed me a stack of food and said \"Here's your triple.\") Anyways, I bring the pizza back and put it back on the hot rack.\n\nAs I'm waiting for my next couple of deliveries to be ready I answer the phone. It's the customer that didn't receive one of his pizzas. Before I can say hardly anything he loudly grumbles \"Y'all didn't give me all my damn pizzas!\" I'm irritated by his nasty attitude but apologize and explain the mix up and that we were very busy on deliveries. Still in the nasty tone he demands to know when he'll get his pizza and I let him know that as soon as the driver gets back she'll be on the way back  with his pizza. He grumbles some more about \"fucking bullshit\" and then says \"Ok bye!\" and hangs up on me. \n\nI leave on my next couple deliveries and when I get back I find out some crazy stuff has gone down. While I was gone the nasty customer showed up at the store and demanded a cash refund for his pizza even though he had paid with a card. My exasperated manager explained that he would refund him for the full order on his card but he couldn't give him cash back when he had ordered on a card. He gets his card refund and then on the way out the door threatened my manager by saying \"I was about to jump over this counter and beat your ass and just take my money.\" At this my manager informs him he will be calling the police and the customer acts all tough and says \"Go ahead!\" before storming out. Remember, we have his name and address because he originally ordered delivery. So that's how stupid this guy is. He had the police called on him and they were given all his information. Today was a crazy day but I'm glad it was busy because I made some good money.",

When I hear little ass kids on the phone I know that it's either going to be a prank call or just a horrifically shitty order that's going to end up with no tip.\n\nSo I do my usual. Delivery or Carryout\n\nThis kid legitimately gives me his address. It was kind of funny actually because I could tell he wanted to go to some joke but was intimidated by me because I have a very aggressive voice (One of the new guys that got hired while I was gone thought I was a manager because of the confidence in my voice).\n\nSo we're in the system, and I mentioned to him that he had an order last time of one pepperoni pizza\n\n\"Nah I'm not gonna do that\"\n\nokay, let's begin.\n\n\"Can I get 6 pizzas and 2 orders of wings\"\n\nI realize at this point that god is dead and that life is a living hell. Usually at this point, I'd get hung up on. But no, this kid has gone further than any other prank caller. My record was getting past the address and getting asked to prepared a \"Jewish Pizza, well done\"\n\nSo he asks for the pizza. And I'm deciding that the best strategy is to take this kid as seriously as possible (Plus this was when there was nothing to do so it wasn't like I was ignoring deliveries or duties).\n\nGonna code this now. M is Me and K is Kid\n\nM: \"Sure man, I can get that for you. 6 pizzas, what kinda toppings would you like on the first one?\"\n\nK: \"Uhh can you make sure they're boneless\"\n\nM: \"Can do, what kinda toppings would you like!\"\n\nK: \"*silence to contemplate defeat* uhhh just make all 6 pepperoni\"\n\nM: \"Fantastic, ill get that in right no-\"\n\nK: \"and can you make sure they're boneless\"\n\nM: \"Can do, man, now let's get onto those wings\"\n\nK: \"Oh and can I get a. . . uh. . . soda\"\n\nM: \"Can do man, we got pepsi, mountain dew, sierra mist, and mug in stock\"\n\nK: \". . . can I get a 2 litre of coke\"\n\nM: \"Nah man we only got pepsi products\"\n\nK: \"Fine, whatever, pepsi. . . and can I get 2 orders of wings?\"\n\nM: \"Sure man, you want those boneless as well, or you wanna do 1 bone-in 1 boneless\"\n\nK: \"Boneless\"\n\nM: \"So you want 2 different sauces? I can just do one large bonless wi-\"\n\nK: \"Hold up, give me a second. . . *obvious ruffling* . . . \"WHAT MOM?! WE'RE NOT GETTING PIZZA?!\". . . h-h-hey u-hhh s-s-sorry m-man my m-mom said w-w-we're not getting p-piz-\"\n\nM: \"Nah man I knew you were prank calling. Don't do that *hang up\"\n\nWHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BONELESS PIZZA SHIT I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD IF ANYONE ASKS FOR A BONELESS PIZZA I'LL TAKE A BONELESS SHIT ON YOUR NEXT ORDER",

That said... here's my latest contribution.\n\nLike many families, we ordered pizza yesterday for dinner. The store is only a few minutes away so I generally will stop in for a carryout from Papa. Yesterday was no different with one exception. When I went in the store, it was vacant.. abandoned. The ovens were running, the prep area was ready but not an employee in sight. I waited patiently, while the phone rang on the counter, for a few minutes, toying with the idea of answering and asking them to hold but I didn't. \nAnyways, minutes later an employee approached from the back area. She apologized, got my order, and I departed. I sat in my car for a few minutes thinking of how easy it would've been to walk in and swipe any order which had been sitting nearby to mine. There was no bell on the door, so really, nobody even knew I was in the store as I also didn't see any video surveillance equipment.\nSo please, everyone, stay vigilant while working and always keep an employee at the front of your store. It could save you a robbery or worse.",

That feeling that the person who just walked through the door is gonna do something stupid, annoying, or dangerous. You can also get this feeling for phone calls but today I'm going to tell you about a carryout customer. \n\n\nI got the vibe as soon as my till person gave the man his total. A tad under $20. The man tries to hand the till dude a $100 bill. \"I'm so sorry, sir. We don't accept any bill larger than a $20.\" This policy is posted online (which is how this particular customer had ordered), on our door, and on our counter. So the customer is obviously upset and confused that we're springing this on him. \n\nAt this point I decide to do some busy work next to the till. I don't like to step in if my employees can handle things. I trust them and their judgement and jumping in early can undermine that trust. \n\nWell the customer wants to try paying with a check now. Till guy turns to check with me because he knows that sometimes we take 'em and sometimes we don't. He's not sure the exact criteria for checks and wants to make sure he doesn't tell a customer the wrong thing. So I let the customer know that we only except checks from organizations such as schools, churches, Boy Scout troops, etc. \n\nThe customer tells us that we can keep our darn pizzas, he'll go to one of our many competitors. Cool. I was hungry anyway. So I void his order and I'm about to grab a slice of his pie when he comes storming back in \"do you accept credit cards?!\" Yeah...we have over 5,000 locations across NA, Europe, and Asia. We take credit cards. \n\nThe customer starts slamming his fist on the counter, punctuating his yelling. We were incredibly incompetent in not offering him the option of paying by credit card. He will be contacting corporate. We should all be fired. His fist keeps slamming down on the counter. Right on one of those pretty, little signs that say \"We Proudly Accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover\". \n\nHe eventually paid via credit card and tipped $6. \n\nI was so proud of my till dude. He handled an angry asshole well, followed company policy, knew the appropriate time to defer to a manager, and somehow made this dipshit customer happy enough to leave us a good review. ",

        "text": "I relate to this sub a lot as a delivery driver of 2.5 long years. I thought I'd share a particularly aggravating moment from a few weeks ago. \n\n\nSo its a few Sundays ago (Father's Day) and I come in at two. Its slow so I answer the phones, which I generally try to avoid at all costs. I happen to take a delivery order for a bunch of subs and pizzas and strombolis and what have you and his final total is $125. Sweet! I'm up next and its been slow so I'm hopeful this will be mine. About ten minutes go by and then I hear the receipt machine spit out a delivery order. Horrified, I see that its for one pizza to this guy who rarely gets food and when he does, he doesn't tip. As in gives exact change and not a penny more. Hes the most condescending customer I have, and we really don't have many of those. So naturally his pizza comes out first, just ahead of the big order and I'm forced to take it. Miraculously I get tipped .03 cents. \n\nNow we're a local shop, and so we have credit card readers. One of the features is that I can see any transaction that any person makes on either a delivery or in-store purchase that uses a card. So being the curious and now-salty driver that I am, I decided to see how much my co-worker who took the big order got tipped. Our readers have four percentage tip options, plus a 'none' and 'custom tip' option. Turns out they tipped him 30% on $125. A $37.5 tip to drive two miles (if that!). I screamed. \n\nMoral of the story: Worry about you. And don't dwell on what could've been. ",

Some can be useful some are dumb as fuck and a waste of time to even read. This was not one of those situations. \n\nA couple days ago it was a standard shit doing my driver thing making boxes delivering pizzas then i get a double. One of the orders states \"send 911 to me\". \n\nWell here i am like wait WTF ask my manager if hes called yet, hes like its probably a prank and to do a security call back and verify if assistance is needed. So i call the guy and ask if everything was okay and if he needed help still, he tells me he does need 911 called and hangs up. Well fuck me right?\n\nI call 911 and give all the info i can and am told if I'm not comfortable going up to the house if officers haven't arrived yet feel free to wait and make contact with the officers. I decided i don't know the situation but they are expecting me  so Ill do my standard go to the house and do it like a normal delivery and get as much info that might be needed for the officers. \n\nI get to the house and up to the door and the guy comes out and  going through the whole pay for the pizza business, he tells me he messed up and ordered the wrong size so he needs to pay with card. I told him i needed to call the info in and asked if he wanted to walk down to the car so we weren't bothering the other people in the house and he says sure. \n\nGot to the car offer him a seat and tell him officers are on there way, asking if everything was fine in the house and trying to get more info in case they take to long and i need to call in a hostage situation or something. (IDK what i am doing all i know is i am just trying to make sure everything is safe.) \n\nHe tell me he needs to relax till officers get there so i call the store and start feeding the card info to my manager.\n\nthe officers took over and he tells them he was having mental health issues and his parents weren't doing anything to help him with it so he reached out the only way he could, through a pizza order. \n\nI'm not sure how it turned out in the end for the guy but i hope it is going better for the guy but it shouldn't have gotten to the delivery driver to do something about this. \n\nPutting call 911 on an order should be taken seriously and dealt with right away. This could of been a lot worse and I'm glad it wasn't and i was able to offer what little help i could to the guy. ",

I can assure you with this phone call that I was pretty much certain it was a prank when I took the actions I did, so I'm going to share it anyway since I think other people should be made aware that this may make the rounds.\n\nI got a call from a kid today, talking in an obviously fake voice from a blocked number. Kid asked for a large cheese pizza, no biggie if the voice hadn't been so fake, I get parents asking kids to make the order quite often. Then I hear another faked voice from obviously away from the phone yelling at the kid about how he (or she) was ordering the wrong pizza, the sound of a stick slapping against wood at about the speed of a very excited puppy's tail smacking on the floor, and the fake-voiced kid fake crying and apologizing. Since I was prepared for this to be a prank from when I first heard the fake voice and the hesitation over the phone number I hang up. Few minutes later same kid, pepperoni instead of cheese, same everything else, so I pull the \"officer please trace this call\" move and hang up. Nothing more so hopefully this won't happen again. Still, very bothered by this prank. Very distasteful and disrespectful. I hope this one isn't going to try making the rounds.\n\nEdit: Just want to add I called the number they were giving. It was some other pizza place. No way it was a legit number or order.",

        "text": "Tonight I had to deliver in a part of my area that requires a bit of extra caution. It takes me a minute to find the house because it was dark and the number on the mailbox was faded. I get out and go up to the porch which has zero lights on and had the front door of the house left wide open. All of the lights inside were off and I couldn't hear or see anyone. I deliver to sketchy areas and houses without lights all the time, but this time made me pretty nervous so I go back to my car and try the number on the receipt twice to no avail. I stand for a second considering my next move and then it suddenly gets darker because the lights from the apartment complex across the street start turning off. However I, already being nervous, assume the worst and that I'm about to fall victim to a robbery or something along those lines. So I quickly get in my car and go to somewhere safer so I can call the store and figure out what to do. They tell me to definitely not go back and to come back to the store. When I get there, the man who ordered calls and says he'd been sitting on the front porch and didn't see anyone. So I'm like shit I had the wrong address, which is quickly confirmed not the case because I ask the man to repeat his address and ask him if he has a red mailbox. He says he does, so then I tell him that's confusing because I was at that exact house 10 minutes ago and there was no one on that porch. He's getting aggressive at this point and asks to speak to my manager. My manager just tells me to go back and that she took off the delivery charge so I needed to reprint the receipt. And then of course when I get back to the same house there's multiple lights on and at least four people out on the porch. So I apoligize and say that it didn't seem like there was anyone there earlier so I took caution and left. But that doesn't stop them from berating me and saying the pizza is now a health hazard and demanding the receipt so they have proof they paid for it or whatever. It was all just very wacky and anyway I just eventually said that if it didn't look like their house was abandoned then none of this would have ever happened. Which they took as me insulting their house and didn't fail to call back my store multiple times stating that I was \"extra\" and \"was cussing them\". The dude also shorted me 75 cents which I didn't realize until I got back because I got out of there as fast as possible. Fuckkkkk white trash hillbillies man.",

        "text": "Today I headed out on a single to a old rundown hotel that is used as housing for immigrant workers. It hasn't roomed anything but these workers for the past 8 years that I've worked at my shop, probably much longer. It had been raining all day, and because of that we were pretty busy. This order was close, but knowing that I'd have a run of 5 when I came back I was walking at a pretty good pace. It's to a room on the second floor, but no problem. I've been to this room a few times in the past. \n\nBefore I get any further, I want you to imagine how wood logs or downed trees feel when they've been under water for awhile. If you know what I'm talking about, you know they're basically the most slippery, slimy things known to man. \n\nSo I'm Olympic Speed-Walking to this room and turn a corner on the outdoor balcony. It's not carpeted or anything, just old and basically rotted wood. Before I know it both feet slip right out from under me sideways and i'm going down fast. There's no catching myself on anything; so I eat shit pretty good. Lucky for me there was a chair sitting outside the nearby room and I somehow managed to land my hot-bag in the chair, but as I do so I fuckin' karate chop the arm of the chair with my hand and forearm. Soaked the ass of my shorts and shirt too.\n\nSurprisingly the pizzas survived the fall despite the heat bag holding them landing 90 degrees rotated. The worst part of it all though is that the rooms these people are housed in are so small they always hangout outside their rooms chatting with one another. In total probably 4 different groups of Jamaicans, or about 15 people watched me crash and burn. Naturally they're all howling with laughter. \n\nThe other driver working with me tonight had another order to the same hotel 20 minutes after this occurred a few rooms away. I hadn't had a chance to tell him the story because we'd both been running, but he told me the customers warned him to \"watch his step\" because it was slippery. I'll be the laughing stock of the place for the next little bit. I don't blame them though, I'd be the first one to laugh watching something like that. That's why i'm sharing with y'all.\n\n",

As I felt myself feeling worse and worse , I called other stores and asked them if anyone would be willing to come in and be a closing driver for the night. \n\nFound someone willing to close, and took another delivery. When I got back from my delivery, I asked my manager if another store had called about a driver to cover my shift. \n\nThey told me that since I had not said anything about it to them first, they told the other store that they didn't need a closing driver. At this point my heart dropped...basically I was stuck at work in 95 degree weather for the next 5 hours, running a fever. So I dragged through the shift and made it home.\n\nThat night I started really getting sick. 103 temperature, cold sweats, sick stomach, vomiting, etc...\n\nThe next day I called at 9 am, 7 hours ahead of my shift to let the managers know I wouldn't be able to make it in. I'm sure no one would've wanted me to be there to spread something around.\n\nTheir response was \"you need to find someone to cover your shift, or you have to come in\"...\n\nHonestly, I've always been under the impression that a shift leader/manager is supposed to be the one finding people from other stores to cover for sick employees. So I went back to bed and immediately started trying everything I could to start feeling better.\n\nNext day came around and I was still very ill. Nothing had changed and I called again, 7 hours before my shift and got the same response. \"You have to find someone to cover your shift or come in\".\n\n2 sick days...the first time I'd ever been that sick that I couldn't make it into work.\n\nI came back to work after the 2 days, and all my closing shifts were gone. All my hours were cut, and the managers kept referring to my sick days as a \"no call no show\"...even though I called both days 7 hours in advance.\n\nNow 3 weeks after the incident, i was nonchalantly asked to get on the computer and look at something. The manager rushed me through it and then just told me to give them a virtual signature at the bottom.\n\nIt was a write up...I was written up for being sick.\n\nCall me crazy...but isn't it a shift leaders job to find someone to cover a shift...not someone who is sick and can barely get out of bed...let alone call multiple stores begging for someone to come in?!\n\nI'm curious about the sick policy entirely...I made sure to call plenty of time in advance. How does this warrant a write up and losing all my hours?!!! Im quite upset about this and I've always been a great worker. People get sick...how does this warrant them getting written up for it?!!!",

I've considered applying for a delivery job but I have a few major questions/concerns.\n\nFirst off, what kind of flexibility can you get? I'm going off to school in a little over two months, and I don't know if that's too short a time to hold the job for. Additionally, I have summer classes, but these are mostly in the morning and really only a few hours a week.\n\nMy parents are also very concerned about the safety of it. I'm not very concerned about this but I'm not sure how to assuage their fears. Have any of you ever been mugged/assaulted, etc? I live on Long Island, and the area is very safe in my opinion, but hearing of your experiences would be cool.\n\nTLDR: 19, going to college in a few months, kind of overbearing parents, would delivery be an OK job for me?\n\n",

It was to a hotel, and of course they have the do not disturb paper hanging off their door. This happens all the time so I knock anyway. When the guy answers the door I greet him as I would any other customer, but he just stares at me blankly, almost looking irritated. Pretty quickly I realize he didn't order so I say \"You must not have ordered pizza huh? Sorry to bother you, I must have the wrong room number\". And that was it. \n\nNow when something like this happens, the first thing I do is call the number on the ticket to talk to the customer to figure out where they're at.

Glance at the tickets and realize I have another order to the same room at the hotel where I bothered the guy earlier. Not to be a nuisance I called the phone number on the ticket as I'm leaving the parking lot. A man answers, and I say my name and the company I'm working for. He cuts me off, and explains he's been anticipating my call, an ensures me that the order is right and that \"I'd made him hungry\". \n\nI get to the hotel and hes waiting outside, walks up to my window and hands me money for the order.

Chris answered the door with a very satisfied smile. we applauded his performance. He had a quick slice of pizza, finished his rounds, then came over for some more pizza. \n\nTL;DR: ordered pizza to my house before I got home.

I'm talking kids cutting school to smoke weed, halfway houses, dope dens, crack houses, drug dealers, prostitutes, dirty cops- you name it. In fact, we had one incident where a guy nodded off with a needle in his arm in the restroom. \n\nWe were all working between 65 and 85 hours a week. My pay, before taxes, was around $400 per week. That blows, until you consider the tips you get from repeat customers seeing the same guys in the same car every single time. A guy I worked with would borrow my car on my day off or if he needed to get out of the place for a bit. We'd pool our tips, which would come out to at least sixty bucks per day. \n\nWhile a lot of the on-the-books money went straight into the car, I was living rent-free a mile from the place. When you cook and clean and run errands for people, they don't seem to ask for money. I had a bit of money saved up once the most dangerous winter of my adult life had ended and I had stopped using some very dangerous drugs. It's amazing how much extra cash you wind up with when you work off your rent, quit smoking, and stop going to bars. \n\nAnyways, I have lots of stories. \nAny interest?\n",

It's less dramatic than the title makes it sound, but still weird.\n\nI get a delivery for a house and recognize the address, but I just assume I had delivered there before. As I start to get closer though, I realize that I had stayed here over Christmas! My parents had rented out this house for a week when they came to visit me and my sister where we go to college. I knock on the door and exchange hellos with the guy who answers, then while he's signing the receipt I ask him if the apartment is still a rental. He says yes, so I tell him that I had stayed in this exact rental last Christmas with my family.\n\nApparently when he said yes to it being a rental though, he meant that they don't own the house, but that they definitely do live there year round, and that they hadn't rented it out for Christmas. At this point I'm very confused but also trying to mitigate being a weird pizza guy as much as possible, so I just apologize and say that I must be thinking of another place, then leave.\n\nThis was FOR SURE the house that my family stayed in for Christmas though. I have no idea what happened, but I figure it's either a., somebody rented their house out over Christmas while they were away without them knowing (unlikely), or b., my family slipped through the fabric of the cosmos at some point and celebrated Christmas in an alternate timeline (highly likely).",

        "text": "Okay, so some context first: in college I worked at a pizza shop owned by a family of Cuzcatleco Salvadorans. The owner was a crazy workaholic. I'm talking \"built a loft above his office so he never has to leave his place of work\" workaholic. I was also being paid under the table on a day-to-day basis, so was often threatened with not being paid that day if I didn't exhibit a similar degree of workaholism.\n\nAnyhoo, it's 2:55AM on a Sunday morning and we get a delivery call. Normally, we do not accept deliveries after 2:30AM (we close at 3), but this order was especially $$$ so my boss takes it. He tells me I'm the one taking it out, and tells the other delivery guy working that night (my roommate, more on that later) to head home. I'm already pretty peeved, because now I have to sit around for 20 minutes while the order is made and then do the order. Earliest I'm getting home is 3:45. \n\nI take a look at the delivery slip. It's 3 towns away--normally we didn't even deliver outside of our home town--and about a 45 minute drive. I bring this to my boss' attention, to make sure there's no mistake, to which he responds \"we're making a lot of exceptions tonight, just roll with it.\" So now I'm crazy pissed off, but if I refuse I'll probably only take tips home that night.\n\nSo I drive out there, it's almost 4AM at this point. I pull up into a pretty fancy neighborhood, and the supposed address is one of those cookie-cutter rich folk homes. I'm starting to get concerned: what kind of person lives in a place like this and gets 5 pizzas delivered at 4AM? Worse, all the lights are out. But, the address matches the slip - according to my phone's GPS - so it must be right, right?\n\nI knock at the door. No answer. Ring the doorbell, same thing. So I take out my phone and call the number on the slip. The moment the guy picks up, the lights in the house's atrium (or whatever) turn on. I finally realize what's happened.\n\n\"Ish thish the fuckin' delivery guy?\" says the obviously drunk individual across the digital divide. \"I ordered that shhit like an hour ago, man, I could've walked there and back quicker!\"\n\nAs the understanding of the situation grips me further, the door to the house opens. In the doorway stands a middle-aged, milquetoast looking man who has clearly just been woken up. He looks pissed. \"Can I help you?\"\n\nWhile the drunk bro is still berating me on the phone and complaining to his drunk bros, I'm trying to explain my situation to Mr. White Guy. He doesn't seem to be liking it.\n\n\"Is this some kind of prank?\" he asks me angrily when I'm done explaining. \"My toddler is up, now, *(I can hear it screaming under the sound of his scolding and over the sound of drunk bro)* it's going to take at least an hour to get her to sleep again. You've woken my whole family, to deliver a pizza we didn't order?\"\n\nAs Sir Whiteness is threatening to call the cops on me, drunk bro is demanding a refund. I begin to back away from the doorway, as Whiteness calls me an asshole and demands to know who I work for. I tell him I'm sorry a bunch of times, which was pretty much killing two birds with one stone because drunk bro thinks I'm talking to him.\n\nSafely back in my car, I tell drunk bro that I'll be there in about an hour and he should take it up with my boss. At about 5AM, I make it to the actual address (which was not given to me by drunk bro, I just assumed it was in the hometown of our shop and was correct). The door is opened by a swarm of drunken, angry bros who are all ganging up to harass me like the pack of apes they are. I hand them all the pizzas, and they obviously don't tip. They slam the door as I turn to leave.\n\nAs I'm walking back to the car, the door opens again. One of the bros, who I can only assume was the one on the phone, shouts at me: [\"YO, BRO, WHERE'S MY DRINK?\"](https://youtu.be/jVGfuQKCSgc?t=1)\n\nSure enough, there's a 2L bottle of Diet Coke on the receipt--my boss didn't give it to me, and in my livid departure I stupidly didn't check that part of the delivery slip. As I drive away, the whole group of bros is shouting at me that \"I better\" come back with their soda.\n\nBack at the pizza shop, I flip my shit at my boss - who not only sent me on a wild pizza chase, but forgot to send me off with the drink. His only reply? \"Well, you've got to bring them their drink.\"\n\n\"FUCK YOU!\" I reply, \"YOU BRING THEM THE DRINK!\"\n\nOf course, this doesn't pan out. As implied, he threatens to withhold my pay for the evening if I don't deliver the drink. So I do. By the time I get to drunk bro's (it was no more than a 3 minute drive from the shop), they're apparently all passed out, because nobody answers the door. I profusely shake the bottle, and leave it on the stoop.\n\nI finally make it home at 5:45AM. My roommate and our friend are still up playing League of Legends, and I immediately recount to them the story of my worst delivery ever. My roommate hands me a packed bowl, tells me to smoke it to my face, then shows me a delicious-looking blunt and tells me I'm going to face it after the bowl *(I didn't)*. I pass out maybe 30 seconds after we finish the blunt, and quit the pizza place the next morning.\n\nTL;DR go on a 2.5 hour delivery to the wrong house, and piss off everyone I come in contact with. [Get to the house, and the drunk bros that ordered the pizza want their soda.](https://youtu.be/jVGfuQKCSgc?t=1)\n\nFuck soda.",

I pulled up beside him and without stopping he yelled \"must deliver pizza,\" turned the corner and ran up to the customer's house.  When he got done I found out that his car had failed to start at the first house and he decided to run about 3 miles with several pizzas rather than screw around looking for a phone.

        "text": "I've worked as a ~~wage slave~~ cashier at a mediocre pizza buffet for several years now, and I've encountered more than my fair share of irrational customers, but the one I dealt with today really takes the cake. Here goes:\n\n\nA lady strolled into my store around 5 o'clock with two other customers. I rang them up and entered a coupon that the lady handed me. I also activated a rewards card for the lady and ran through the basic layout of the buffet with her, since this was her first time eating at my store. Completely normal exchange that I have multiple times a shift.\n\n\nThen, almost immediately after I finished ringing her up, the lady returned to my register to tell me that she needed a gluten-free pizza prepared for her. I informed her that, unfortunately, gluten-free pizzas have to be purchased in full off the menu for about the price of an adult buffet. I then said that I would be happy to have my manager void our first transaction and ring up a gluten-free pizza for her, pointing out that she might end up saving a dollar or so in the process. She sneered something along the lines of \"it's a little late for that, don't you think?\" in my direction and walked away. I felt terrible for approximately 4 seconds before I realized that I couldn't care less about this customer or her problems, so I continued on with my shitty day.\n\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the lady strutted back up to me and flicked her recently-activated rewards card onto the front desk, saying \"I won't be needing this anymore\" in the most passive-aggressive tone I've ever heard before returning to her table. I instantly recognized this as her attempt to make me feel bad by implying that she'll never return to my store, which was funny to me, because I would've left this store for good months ago if I weren't so desperate for money.\n\n\nAnyways, a little while later, I began to notice that the lady was dishing up a decent amount of pizza from the buffet, which surprised me considering her apparently debilitating gluten allergy. \n\n\nThe lady eventually returned to the front desk once again while I was halfway through a phone order. She stood there with her arms folded, waiting for me to hang up. Once I did, she told me she wanted to speak to my manager without even looking in my direction. \n\n\nI retrieved my manager from the kitchen and introduced her to the lady, who instantly started tearing into me and my apparently lackluster service. First, she accused me of incorrectly applying her coupon to the original ticket; fortunately, my manager stood up for me and told her that she just didn't read the coupon correctly.\n\n\nThen, she had the audacity to say that I rang her up for a normal buffet knowing that she was allergic to gluten and refused to correct my mistake, while the exact opposite was true. She even said that all she'd eaten was salad and soup even though I'd watched her dish up pizza with my own eyes. My manager apologized and refunded her entire meal, which really pissed me off. The lady started to walk away, but not before muttering something unflattering about me under her breath.\n\n\nAt this point, I arrived at a critical crossroads in my pizza career. I asked myself if I could justify freaking out at this lady if it would mean losing my job. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), my rational side took control and I kept my mouth shut as this witch of a human being slinked out of my store with the most aggravating smile on her face. I've never been closer to just giving up and quitting on the spot.\n\n\n**TLDR:** Evil woman harrassed me for doing my job correctly.\n\n\nPS: I know this story is far from the most interesting thing to be posted on this subreddit, but I felt like anyone who's ever worked in the food industry could relate  to my experience of dealing with an irrational customer.

I say \"You didn't order a cookie. I don't know what to tell ya.\" She starts cursing and yelling about her cookie and her order being late. I checked the receipt again and no fucking cookie was on there. I told her that it was her fault since she made the order herself through our website. Oh, she asked for her fucking $0.25 tip back. She insisted that it was my fault. I walked away because I couldn't stand her foul mouth anymore. As I get into my car, she chases after me and superman punches my car and stomps on my bumper. I fucking burned tire getting out of there. \nWhen I get back to the store, my manager approaches me about a complaint. Turns out, it was THAT FUCKING LADY. She told my manager that I was being rude.

        "text": "Took a delivery to some project townhomes in MN. Parked in the lot and walked up and knocked on the unusual glass patio door with slightly open vertical blinds. I could see through the blinds on the door that there were people/ (kids) inside who were not reacting at all to my knocking. After a minute or so I decided it must be a prank call and I left. I got back to the store and was told that the customer had torn the blinds off the door trying to answer it, although I did not see this happen and I was careful to watch the door as I left in case someone came out at the last minute.\n\nI was given a fresh pizza (a freebie for their \"trouble\", no less) and instructed to go to the back door, which was a long walk through a dark-ass courtyard. There was a huge screen door on a spring and I propped it open with my foot and knocked.  As I handed over the pizza, the woman opened the box and basically screamed at me: \"Why's it always gotta be SO COLD?\" as she put her finger in the middle of the pizza that was freshly out of the oven. \"OWWW\" she screamed as she pulled her finger away and put it in her mouth.  I smiled and told her to have a nice night and let go of the door, which began to swing rapidly.  I caught it with the pizza bag and let it close more gently but it still made a bit of a bang even just swinging a couple inches.\n\nI got back to the store and she called and complained I was rude and that she now had broken blinds and a broken door because of me -  her claims were false, she just wanted a free pizza and was willing to go to great lengths to get it.

        "text": "I work as a cook at a Pizza Hut in northern NJ: my job is to basically put sauce, cheese and whatever toppings on pizzas and put them in the oven. However, having worked the job for a bit, I know how to do most other things too. \n\nOne day, right after we were done basically closing the store (putting all the ingredients in the fridge and cleaning up our workstations,) a guy calls in and tells me about this coupon deal he found in a magazine for $8 medium pan pizzas. I confirm that the coupon works, so he goes ahead and orders 21 of them. Take a second to appreciate the magnitude of this - he could have called in a couple hours earlier and said he planned to do this, but there was no reason to apparently (we had time to make them all at 11:45 pm, right?) \n\nSo we break everything outta the fridge and start making pizzas. Guys stay past their shifts to do it all, and against all odds, we have 21 medium pizzas ready to go. The guy comes in with two other people, each of whom carry three pizzas, and he somehow expects me to carry the other 12 to his car with him. Unfortunately, he was getting angry, and I didn't want to bother my manager at the end of the day, so I keep my mouth shut and do it. \n\nWe're at the parking lot at 12:15 am, and this guy starts complaining that the pizzas will all fall off his seat. \"I paid good money for these! You guys need to make customers like me happy!\" he remarks. My manager point-blank says no to his request of three driver bags ($6 each,) and the guy walks out in a huff that we didn't do our jobs.\n\nAnyone else have customers like this?",

He tells me to come into the house and place the food on the table for him, and when I politely refuse saying its company policy he goes on a tangent about how times have changed and how good service is no longer around etc etc. \n\nI give in and come inside, where he proceeds to close the door behind me (wtf seriously dude). Already feeling incredibly uncomfortable, I turn after placing the pizza on the table and notice his hand held out with the money, but below his hand, a massive erect bulge pushing from behind his bathrobe. \n\nSeeing this all I can think is to leave ASAP, my balloon knot isn't being intruded tonight, was in no mood for the chocolate cha cha.

I am not going to reveal any names or personal information or even the state where this took place. All I will say is that it took place somewhere in the Midwest and I am 20 years and well over 800 miles removed from it.\n\nI've worked as a driver, counter help, line cook, shift manager, acting store manager, and assistant store manager, and that was just for Papa John's. I've also been pizza chef at a bowling alley and delivery driver for an Italian restaurant that did catering and pizza. Driving is in my blood, apparently, because I currently drive a truck for a restaurant supply company in New England. \n\nAnyway. Papa John's. I really miss those days. I don't know if this was corporate policy or specific to my DM, but they said food and labor costs had to be under 41%. I'd been at this particular store, working my way up, for well over three years. It was in an area where new neighborhoods were constantly popping up. I would go out on days off and drive from the store to these new neighborhoods to see if we could get there in a reasonable amount of time. If we could, I would either tell the store manager to add the streets into the system or use their log in and do it myself. And if we couldn't, I would call the store in the next town over and tell them about the neighborhood.\n\nWhen our GM left due to pregnancy, I offered to step in and take over the store. Needless to say, I knew the area and the business. I knew when it would be busy and when it would be slow, and I was never caught with my pants down, so to speak. And my numbers showed it. We were consistently between 35 and 37%. Add to this the fact that I was a \"do me a favor\" type manager and people enjoyed working with and for me because of it. \n\nFor whatever reason, they never gave me the GM title. Instead, they brought in a guy whose management experience was at a UPS store type business. He had never done food service, he didn't even live in the town, and he had never had our pizza. The first week I had already done the schedule, but he changed it by calling in extra drivers and insiders on Friday and Saturday. That week, food and labor was 41%. For the next four weeks, it was closer to 46%. My DM actually accused me of sabotaging him in order to get the position for myself. We had words, and that ended my career with Papa John's. I couldn't even go to a different store in the area because ours was almost dead center of the DM's territory.",

I was in store and was answering phones to help out. \n\n\"Thanks for calling! Will this be for delivery or carry out?\"\n\n\"I want a pizza delivered to xxxxx Mohican street\"\n\nNow our phones were always too quiet and I don't have the best hearing to begin with, so even a well speaking customer would turn to static. This man was not a well speaking customer. It immediately sounded like he had been drinking.\n\n\"I'm sorry sir, would you spell out that street name for me?\"\n\n\"What are you, fucking stupid? Mohican, like the Native American tribe.\"\n\n(I probably should have hung up here, but I didn't know that I was allowed to.)\n\n\"Be that as it may sir, I need a spelling for the street name.\"  \n\n\"Jesus Christ no wonder why you work at Pizza Hut\"\n\nThe exchange must have continued pretty normally from there as I don't remember much of interest aside from being slightly nervous when heading off to his house. Around 20 minutes after his order was placed I'm walking up his driveway. All the lights were off outside the house, but there were lights on inside the house. The house had a section that extended about 15-20 feet past the front door to the right, what I assume to be a living room or a bedroom. As I walk up to the door I pass a cracked window from which cartoon noises are coming from. The door is mostly glass with wood trimming the top and covering the bottom 30%, though a curtain inside the door prevents me from seeing anything but a light on inside. I knock on the door and the TV immediately stops making noise from the window. I hear what sounds like a few kids whispering intently.\n\n\"Someone's here\"\n\n\"Get into position, go go go\"\n\nIt's around here that I start freaking out a little bit. I mutter something along the lines of \"oh shit.\" as the whispering subsides. A very large dog runs up to the door and barks *really* aggressively . A few seconds later the dog is pulled away without noise from inside.\n \nSuddenly \"IDENTIFY YOURSELF!\" - a mans voice, heavy slurring and yelling. \n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"IDENTIFY YOURSELF IMMEDIATELY!\"\n\n\"Number1lion... from Pizza Hut?\"\n\n\"WHICH PIZZA HUT ARE YOU FROM?!\n\nAt this point I was a tad frustrated, and still unable to see who I'm talking too thanks to the curtain. \n\n\"The Pizza Hut you ordered from? I have other deliveries sir.\"\n\nAs I say that the door swings open and a man in a wife beater lowers a shotgun. I immediately back up a bunch and start my trademark panicking/stammering.\n\n\"WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH DUDE HERE.\"\n\nI try to hand him the pizza assuming I was getting robbed.\n\n\"Relax son, a mans just gotta protect his home you know? Now that I know you're the pizza guy you're fine. How much do I owe you again?\"\n\nHe ends up tipping me 4$ and leaves me standing in his doorway with a lot of confusion and adrenaline. I drove back to the store at around double speed and told my GM to blacklist that sob.\n\nOverall 2/10 I need at least 10$ for someone to threaten to shoot me.\n\n\nEdit:forgot to explain title. After giving me my tip he mentioned that he got nervous and went all Rambo on my ass because he didn't expect me for at least 20 more minutes.",

I understand it's probably just their parents' car that they had to borrow, but it does make me do a double take. \n\nThe other day, I ordered some hot wings and stuff for me and my girlfriend (about a $20 order) from a local restaurant, and the driver was a young guy (looked between 18 and 22) with a BMW 325 (e46 generation, from '98 to '06). With a car that age, it's highly possible that he worked 2-3 jobs and saved up to buy it himself, but I think if you busted your ass for that nice of a car, you're not gonna want to subject it to that kind of abuse like delivering food in a dense city environment. When I was delivering I drove a 12 year old volkswagen that constantly had a check engine light. One time it was in the shop and I had to borrow my friend's car, an Audi of the same age, even though it was in even worse shape than mine (literally falling apart and barely drivable, I had to beg my friend to let me use it because he said he didn't want me to die), but I still couldn't help but wonder if customers were judging me for showing up in an Audi.\n\nI had tipped 20% on the card ahead of time when placing the order online, and I'm glad I did because I probably would have hesitated with the tip, and in retrospect I would have regretted the impulsive decision to tip 15% instead of 20 because of my assumptions about his life. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I believe that 15% is unofficially mandatory, earned pay, due to the minimum wage exemption in the US (unless it's one of the rare restaurants that pays all drivers min wage or more). \n\nI'm curious if you've been in the position of delivering in a nice car and if people gave you hard time about it or punished your tips.",

        "text": "I've delivered pizza for over six years now, and myself get food delivered to my house fairly frequently.  I am amazed at how many drivers, after giving them cash, ask how much change I need back.\n\nFirst of all, a tip is a bonus.  I know we depend on it, but trust me - if you look at it this way you'll make it a lot easier on your sanity when you do get stiffed.  And really, it IS a bonus, they don't HAVE to tip anything.  So it's kinda presumptuous and thus unprofessional to ask that question. \n\nSecondly, it's a completely unnecessary question.  You just need to pay a little bit of attention.  If someone hands you money and says \"thank you,\" that's pretty much a sure sign they have, in their mind, completed the transaction.  If they don't, then just pull out your cash and start counting out their change.  Lots of times they'll just stop you and say you're good.\n\nThirdly, its better for you this way.  People who tip want to feel good from tipping, good about themselves that they did a good thing and treated the pizza guy right.  And they arent going to feel that if you're just acting like its a given they will tip you.  If you start counting out their change, and they say \"oh you keep it,\" and you act a little surprised or whatever and say \"oh ok thanks a lot man,\" chances are it's going to make them feel good and they will possibly remember next time that you were actually grateful, and tip again, maybe even more.\n\nQuit asking how much change they want back.

This lady was blazed out of her own mind. \n\nSo I began the usual pizza transaction and told her the total was $36 even. She then proceeds to give me two $20 bills. $4 tip, nice not going to complain. She then goes back into her wallet for my tip and hands me another $16 for a grand total of $20 tip. I just started this whole pizza delivery about a month and a half ago so this $20 is jaw dropping to me.\n\nAfter that, she asks if my workplace drugs test. I start thinking, is she going to offer me a bong hit or something. Do I decline the said bong hit? I told her no they do not and she asked: \"Have you ever dabbled in marijuana?\"\n\nI said yeah a couple times I have. She then went into her freezer and pulls out some edible cookies, gives me three of them and says enjoy. I thanked her endlessly and left her house. The delivery ended up with a $20 tip and some edible cookies.\n\nTL;DR: Went on a delivery to a high chick's house. Ended up with a $20 tip and some edible cookies. ",

The driver doesn't even get a choice in it, the owner's policy is to always accept these requests and charge nothing for it. Personally I hate doing this, because I am going out of my way to the store and not being paid for it at all, and may not even get a tip for it either.  I haven't had any deliveries with this request for a while until today (although I've seen the other drivers get deliveries with alcohol and cigarette stops from time to time). \n\nSo today I had a discussion with my boss about it. I showed my boss that delivering alcohol without a liquor license in Ontario is illegal, and now we no longer have to take these alcohol deliveries. So now my question is, is it legal for the driver to pick up and deliver cigarettes, in Ontario? If it makes a difference, I am an independent contractor (which I realize is probably not legal itself, but right now I want to focus on the cigarette deliveries, lol). I did a quick google search and found no clear answer, and I know there are a few people here who are very knowledgable when it comes to the law, so I'd appreciate some help.\n\nThank you!",

Both office buildings somewhat near each other, and it also happens that I've been to these addresses several times. Easy as cake right?\n\nI show up at the first one. A lady is waiting outside. I ask to confirm that she's the one I'm looking for, she is. She hands me $3 more than the total and tells me to keep the change. Cool. On to the next one. \n\nNow, the second delivery was at an office building that has around 5 or 6 different suites. Whoever took the order didn't take note of which suite the food was going to. No big deal. I'll call and ask. \n\nThe customer doesn't give me a suite number or a business name, she just tells me to come in the side door and walk up the flight of stairs. So I drive to the side of the building and go in. I get up there and the door is locked. An employee walking by sees me holding four sheet pizzas and lets me in. He tells me that it's likely going to the conference room down the hall. We part ways, I walk to the conference room. The lady inside says (in a very condescending tone) no one from there had placed an order, and that I wasn't supposed to even be inside that area of the building. \n\nShe escorts me to the front desk area of the suite, where I set the pizzas down and call the customer. No answer. I waited a minute and tried again. Still nothing. Alright, this is getting a little annoying. I shoot a text to my manager telling him that I'm having some trouble and I'll be back asap. (Keep in mind I've been in the building for 10-15 minutes at this point) He's cool with that. \n\nA minute or two later I get a call from the customer, and I apologize for the confusion and let her know that I'm having some trouble finding her. I tell her where I am and it turns out that she's in the suite just across the hall, she'll meet me there. I walk across the hall and, again, I'm told that no one by that name works there.\n\nI was really baffled at this point, but thankfully a nearby employee overheard the situation and she said \"I know so and so, she's with the company downstairs.\" She was kind enough to take me to this person. After 25 minutes of walking around, asking around, and playing phone tag, i found the customer. I was very apologetic about the wait even though I don't feel it was really my fault. Just followed the directions I was given.\n\nDespite all of this, she gave me a $16 tip on the credit card slip and my managers werent upset that I was gone for so long, so it was whatever.\n\nAgain sorry for the length of my post, but wanted to share this kind of odd experience I had today.

Is this a common thing???\n\nOnly started delivering a month and a half ago, but it seems like literally 7 out of the 12 other drivers we have are fucking lazy and don't do shit. I'll preface by saying our managers are incompetent and our GM frankly doesn't give a fuck because we need the drivers.\n\nNote these are all fake names for privacy purposes: \n\n\nFirst we have Franky, he's scheduled literally 8 hours a week max, doesn't work another job, and is like 30 so I don't know how he survives. Not only is he scheduled two shifts a week, but literally *every* fucking week he will call out once with some bullshit excuse. This week it was his \"foot was hurting\", last week he supposedly got pinkeye. Not to mention his new 2016 chevy he's leasing has 'broken down' 3 times since I started working here (funnily enough I magically saw him in the mcdonalds drivethru in his car which was supposed to be in the shop, next to our store when he was supposed to be on shift). \n\n\nNext is Josh. He's a college student about 5'3 and will always start shit with coworkers and even *fucking customers*. He literally postured up and started talking shit when a middle aged man bumped into him as he sped walk out the door with a delivery this week. He's bumped into our waiters and knocked over their dishes, yelled profanities in the prep room for the entire dining room to hear after dropping pans, and blasts his shitty trap music from his phone in the store/from his subwoofer while parked outside for 5 minutes before taking his delivery. \n\n\n\nThen there is Mike. Mike smokes cigs all the time. He smokes before his shift, during his shift, before/after deliveries, and yes, during deliveries. The prep room will smell like a strip club in the 60's whenever he lingers for more than a minute, so I assign him some menial task so he can get the fuck out of my smelling radius and then go chainsmoke again. All of our fucking heat bags smell like an ashtray from him. \n\n\nLast and most rage inducing driver is another college student, Tyler. The guy was a valedictorian and goes to a good university in the area on a full academic scholarship, but he has no fucking idea what to do in the store after working here for the same time as me. Literally all he knows how to do is prep pans and breadsticks. He can't fucking fry wings, he doesn't know how to use the dishwasher, he doesn't know where to put shit in the freezer, he can't even fucking take a customers order over the phone/counter. This dude straight up acts like one of the dumbest motherfuckers I've seen to avoid working it's actually comical. GM will get frustrated whenever he tries to teach him something new and he acts retarded, so he gives up, and lets him sit in the back like a big boy spraying the large pans with food release like Michael J. Fox on shrooms at a rate of 10 pizzas an hour. He always makes fast deliveries at least, but stops at his mommy's apartment probably every night shift to eat his dinner (i've literally seen hugging his mom and walking to his car with a plate with tinfoil on top while delivering to the same complex).\n\n\nJust mentioned a few here, wondering your guys' experiences, and why the *fuck* drivers like these still have jobs. \n",

Which he did. 2 dollars.\n\nCool, that was that for the night.\n\nLast night however, I deliver to him again. He puts a strike on the tip line and writes the total. \n\nI laughed as I walk away.

        "text": "Happened the other day. \n\nI was the only driver on shift, so I had to take a double. The second one was to a factory and usually I make a little goody bag even when they don't ask for it. Usually just a plate or two, napkins, forks, and some cheese and pepper. Even though the factory order wasn't large, I put two forks in. \n\nI get to the first guy, who I have never delivered to when he's not completely wasted. He's an older guy, a veteran who doesn't move well. He can barely ever hand me the money. That day, he got a pasta. When I was about to leave he asked if I brought a fork (I doubt he very well can get off his couch). Well look at that, turns out there's an extra in my car (for the factory guy). \n\nI get it, give it to him then go to the next delivery. Guy looks a bit annoyed, which honestly, understandable. I was late, it's been busy. I handed him the goody back and the pizza and he asked if I had any cheese and pepper on me (generally no, only if it's on the receipt). I actually forgot and almost told him no. But, well look at that! I did, in fact, put it in the bag.  I told him that and his face lit up a bit and I ended up with a 6 dollar and some change tip. \n\nIt's stupid but it makes me feel happy, especially for how it worked out. ",
