        "text": "My friend and I met during our first year of nursing school four years ago. She flunked out of the four year program and enrolled in a two year program last year. We are  both set to graduate come summer time next year. We used to go out and do non-school related stuff together but within the last two years I’ve noticed her idea of ‘plans’ is springing some type of school work onto me. For example, she invited me to a friendsgiving and almost as soon as I set foot in her place pulled out a work book and sat next to me awhile I basically did her entire assignment for her. That was the last time I saw her (October) and today she messaged asking if I could come over Friday to help with something else. I’m all for helping out here and there but sometimes I feel like she only makes time to ‘catch up’ because I’m basically a free tutor and not a friend she genuinely wants to see. If she doesn’t have any school work she needs help with, she doesn’t ask to hangout.  I don’t know how to express my feelings to her and I’m not sure if I should. We are both busy with school but I don’t believe the help or friendship is mutually reciprocal. \n\nSuper awkward! Any advice? Am I being unreasonable?",

        "text": "Hi all, looking for some advice here. I’m 32F, in a relationship with a fantastic partner of just over a year. We recently moved in together and it’s going great, we are aligned on so many things. He lived alone years before he met me and we balance chores and cooking. His family is incredible, we’ve met up with them all quite a bit and he, and his family, are the kind of people I’d like a future child of mine to grow up knowing and influenced by.\n\nI was previously married (until I was 29); all my life I wanted kids desperately but things never felt right with my ex and I always had a (valid!!) reason not to do it. With my current partner, I look at him and I just feel confident that he’s my future and I want this.\n\nThat being said, I have lingering doubts - were stable, but will we have enough money to live the way I want to with kids? Am I rushing this and should I wait another year to get to know him better? \n\nTo add, I have a few medical issues where I’d need to adjust my meds prior to trying to get pregnant, and this makes the whole thing seem so…formal. I’d love to be in a spot where I’m sort of in actively trying and if it happens great, but the medication thing makes it seem like I’d have to be 100% sure. Of course, I have fear and doubts about this not physically working out too.\n\nI suppose the logical thing is to listen to my gut and I acknowledge that some responses will confirm that if I’m having doubts, then there’s no rush. But I guess I just want to see if there’s a possibility that someday I’ll wake up and just feel certain. Logically I know that there will be risks and fears, no matter which route I take. But I also know that this is what I want with this person, and I always wanted to have kids while I’m still relatively young.",

Still single as hell. The truth is, in the last 5 years I haven't been trying much to make this possible. Rarely go out, introvert, hardly have a social life. Apps on and off. WFH. My world has been quite small for a long time. I like it that way but it is clearly not working as I cannot expect \"him\" to just come to my door.\n\nEarlier this year I was SA by someone I was dating. I've never \"spoken\" that except for here right now so thanks for letting me just say it to someone. Another year felt robbed from me (this year) as I am only now just know coming back to myself and participating in life again. It was a difficult dark year for me, the toughest yet. A tide is turning as I work through the trauma and am picking myself up and out of this hole. The only positive I can take from this year is gratitude for the health of my family and that I've cleaned the hell out of my diet. I am trying to just be proud and gentle with myself that I survived this year when I wanted to quit it all. \n\nAnywho I just feel sad and unsettled. Seeing all the beautiful family photos of friends who now have babies and toddlers is getting me in my feelings. One friend is in Disneyland with her adorable 3 year old and I cried alone in my bed scrolling. My life feels so quiet which I used to like but now it feels like deafening silence and emptiness. I know a man and a baby won't fix my life or make me happy. I have to be happy first. I am working on it slowly but surely. I know a happy person is attractive  and that is my goal, for myself, above all else. \n\nI am trying to remind myself a couple of years late is not a big deal in the whole scheme of life. Right?",

I live in a \"destination\" city yet want to leave. I can either force myself to practice more gratitude and try to start over without moving (mindset shift, but probably with lingering sad feelings)... or I can take the riskier route and forfeit my not-so-great-but-not-the-worst apartment and just say YOLO and uproot my life.\n\nI have typed out SO MANY DRAFTS of this post but I always end up word vomiting my life story. So, I've decided to force myself to keep my thoughts vague-ish. I'm happy to clarify anything that might help get more meaningful answers.\n\nHere are the thoughts that have been circling my mind and giving me anxiety lol:\n\n* Inflation + \"single tax\"- Not struggling (yet) but like many others inflation hit me like a train and despite having a solid income I'm basically paycheck-to-paycheck now and recently depleted my savings for emergency expenses. Lately I've been feeling the burden of being a single-earner but I don't want roommates and that's non-negotiable.\n* Declining area- my neighborhood isn't what it used to be ever since that law came out where people can steal up to like \\~$900 without any major repercussions in CA. People are generally meaner and sketchier these days. I used to be able to go on food runs alone at 2am or get gas at night in \"bad\" areas of town without feeling scared at all. Now, I feel on edge all the time even in broad daylight. Recently at my apartments, 6 car windows were bashed + they stole all 4 of a neighbor's tires all in one night.\n* Weather- Southern CA is all I know... People look at you like you are on crack if you tell them you want to leave this city. People call the weather here \"perfect\"... is a mild climate something I need to appreciate more? Is it really all that bad to live somewhere with 4 seasons, hot-summers, or cold-winters?\n* Identity politics-  I NEVER ever, ever heard the word \"minority\" to refer to me until post-2020 when everything got hyperpolarized. Every time I talk about moving states people give me a speech with warnings about how I'm going to experience a culture shock and will experience discrimination. Respectfully, I don't have a victim-mentality as a \"minority\". However, I realize that could be because I live in a SUPER diverse city. I'm open to being educated on this so please share your experience if you are able to offer perspective- whether good, bad, or neutral.\n* Small-town vibes- Despite being from a major city with endless suburban sprawl, everyone seems to know everyone, in the worst way. I won't get too personal, but lets just say I've been through quite a few TW-esque experiences + bad childhood.. If I meet new people or even just run errands &gt;30min from my apt I almost ALWAYS run into someone I know or meet someone who knows someone from my traumatic past or abusive family. \n\n**TLDR:** I pay WAY less than market value for my apartment in my southern CA hometown, \\~1000 less than current rates because of rent control. Because of this, if f I leave and decide to come back...  my cost of living would basically double. This makes me reluctant to ever leave even though I'm not happy. Sure, the weather is \"unbeatable\" but wherever I go I have constant reminders of the series of unfortunate events from my earlier life. I'm in a good place now, but that's only because in my mid-20s I became a hermit and no longer tolerate BS. I've been a shut-in for almost 3 years now. I actually make friends easily but it's pretty much exclusively with transplants who aren't from here. Plussss crime is increasing rapidly in my direct vicinity, but given the economy I realize that this is probably true everywhere. I just don't want to keep living this way (isolated and in fear). I often wonder if could I have a happier life if I just move and start over. Or, I could start trying to make the best out of where I am now.",

But I knew it would mean a lot to her if I did.\n\nOne thing I (maybe always secretly) cherished about our friendship is that my friend was always very candid and frank about everything, including her thoughts on marriage and kids and that she didn’t really desire either but ended up getting married (said her husband grew on her) and now recently told me she is pregnant with twins, after just getting off birth control a few months ago and “not really even trying.”\n\nShe expressed she felt pressure from her mom and also her age, which I do understand. She’s expressed all leading up to pregnancy and even in the early weeks that she doesn’t even know if she wants to be a mother. In this sense I can’t really relate to her but I understand it because I know her as a friend.\n\nBut quite honestly, I don’t really want to talk about babies or this milestone further right now. I know my feelings stem from me wanting marriage and motherhood (I have a boyfriend, we recently have been talking about engagement but it hasn’t happened yet and time is not on my side) and from literally every good friend I have already being married and one or two children in, some who have even been finished having kids now for a few years. For every engagement/marriage/pregnancy, I attend every event/shower I can, I chat with my friends about their next milestone, I buy gifts, etc. I am always happy for them even if I simultaneously feel wistful to wanting that also. But each time I’ve recognized that even if now is not my time, I can still celebrate them to fullest, and I do.\n\nThis makes me sad that I don’t want to see my friend because I do pride myself on being a good friend to everyone in my life and I want to support her. I just think this is just the straw that is breaking the camel’s back for me personally, and I recognize it’s not her fault. I just don’t think I can be the friend she needs me to be or that I feel I can be, through this stage of her life right now. \n\nI’m also kind of mourning the loss of our friendship as it was - all of my friendships have changed when they had kids. And I love kids! Our friendships are just not the same without me having them, too.\n\nI feel like a terrible person! Has anyone (older, perhaps?) had similar feelings and thoughts and can provide some wisdom to change how I feel so I can still be a good friend?\n\nTL;DR: Very good friend is pregnant with twins and I’m struggling how to support her as someone who also wants motherhood, while feeling tapped out supporting everyone else, I don’t think I can be the friend she needs me to be.",

        "text": "First off, I know I should talk to a therapist about this and I am going to, but there are some holiday events to get through first. I need advice.\n\nI want to have a good relationship with my in-laws, but I feel like my judgements are getting in my way. My husband's family is large and drama-filled. My family is very small and has zero drama. Culturally different backgrounds too, so I'm out of my element in general. I'm specifically struggling with his parental figures, and I'll try to explain the things that are roadblocks for me as briefly as possible. Also for more context, we have a 3 month old baby, our first.\n\nGrandparents - his primary \"parents\". This one is less of a relationship problem but still causing me high anxiety. Their house has been roach and rat infested for years and terrifies me. I hate taking baby there. They aren't able/don't want to come to us. I initially insisted they have to come see baby at our house, but after they finally did they expressed it was too much for them and they won't do it again, but still expect to see him. I don't fight this much, but I'm always extremely anxious when husband takes baby there. Husband agrees it's gross but grew up there and was kind of normalized to it I guess. \n\nMom - this might be the one I'm struggling most with. His mom was never a good mom. She has BPD, addiction problems, is illogical, and is known for making everything about her. On one hand, I am very sympathetic to mental health and addiction problems, but I'm struggling with her because of how shitty of a mom she was/is and she doesn't acknowledge any of it. Instead she has a very fragile ego and we have to pretend she's this great normal mom to not upset her. I don't think she should keep paying for past mistakes, but I'm just struggling with joining in this facade when I know of so many horrible things she's done. She's seen our baby once, but she's wanting to see him more and told husband she wants to get to know me more. I have no desire to know her more, but I don't want to feel this way. \n\nAunt - husband is very close to this aunt and her children. She is easy to get along with and is not dramatic like most of the family. The catch here is that her husband is currently awaiting trial for sexual abuse of his daughter from a previous marriage. There is reason to believe the accusations are true. CPS has warned her she might lose her kids if she keeps him around, which she has done. Husband and I have made it clear we want nothing to do with her husband, but he still is at family events making everyone uncomfortable. My husband is devastated by all of it. We do agree that our son isn't going to be alone with them, but she is still an active part of everyone's lives so I'm trying to get over my judgements. I just don't understand how she could put her kids in jeopardy and stay with him, even if he is their father. \n\nI'm not religious at all, but I do think the idea of separating the \"sin\" from the sinner and forgiving people are good practices. Especially in this case because these people are family and haven't done anything to me, so my judgements feel like a me problem. I want my son to have support from his dad's side of the family, and I worry that if I don't get over these things that I will be the cause of drama in the family and will push other members away. I'm a terrible actor and struggle to put on a front.\n\nI would love some advice, especially if you have experienced something similar and overcome it.",

I often look around at other women and their long standing friendships and think wow how does it come so easy for them? To be able to connect easily, not feel competitive, be vulnerable, not be self conscious, and give freely, with little effort. I guess sometimes it just feels like I am the only one who struggles with this while other women make this look so natural and easy.

        "text": "I have a friend who I've known for 10 years. I've noticed a pattern over the past year or so that she only contacts me when she wants something. \n\nI used to smoke weed so I'd hear from her quite a lot when she wanted some but since I quit I hear from her way less. She'll ignore my messages for weeks at a time. A few weeks ago I messaged her checking in and seeing if she wanted to get dinner or a drink and she didn't even read it. \n\nThen I get a message when she's in crisis again and wants weed. I told her I'm not smoking anymore. She invited me out after that and I declined because I was sick and now she's messaged again asking for money, which I'm going to say no to. I probably won't here from her again for at least a month after I say no. Like she won't even read my messages.\n\nLast time this happened I raised it with her and she told me she's just not good at messaging and she's not ignoring me. I tried to take this on and give her the benefit of the doubt, I even blamed myself that I was just being sensitive. I think that's the upsetting thing. \n\nI know I am sensitive to rejection and abandonment, but I really don't think that's the main issue at play here. It's probably more that I have acquiesed a lot in the past to avoid rejection and then end up getting it anyway once the need is met. \n\nI know she does care about me, she's got a pretty chaotic life/life style and has difficulty seeing past her own needs. She has been diagnosed with BPD after childhood trauma and this behaviour reflects her upbringing.   \n\nI care about her a lot. I don't want to walk away from the friendship but I want to address this pattern. but I don't want it to be like I'm attacking her. I don't know how to raise it sensitively and as a conversation rather than an accusation.",

        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI need some advice.\n\nLast night my spouse and I were laying in bed watching tv, and his phone rang around 10pm. He looked at it and the number said this woman’s name (I’ll use Jane Doe). **Immediately, this looks really bad.**\n\nMy spouse seemed genuinely confused and answered the phone “hello?” and put it on speaker phone so I could hear. She was clearly intoxicated and said “oh hi good looking!!! I meant to call someone else but now that I have you.. where are you??” \n\nHe responded with “I’m in bed, with my spouse. Why are you calling?” \n\nShe doubles down and it becomes obvious that this was a really lame attempt at a booty call. \n\nMy spouse ended up getting angry after she continued on and on and said “this is incredibly inappropriate. Do not call me again. I am in bed with my spouse, this is super disrespectful. Do not contact me again.”\n\nI obviously was IMMEDIATELY skeptical, he instantly showed me his phone, showed me that he hasn’t spoken to her in years, (at least a year prior to us meeting, yes he keeps all of his old texts). He gave me full access to everything on his phone (which I have anyways, but do not take advantage of that privilege. I have never looked through his phone before), but he just to prove that this was completely unprovoked. \n\nBoth my spouse and I do not use social media. I have people from my past reach out sometimes because they don’t know I’m in a relationship, but I instantly inform them I’m happily in a relationship and it’s never an issue. We all move on like adults. \n\nHowever, this is where things get obnoxious. She was so fucking rude and disrespectful toward him when he said he was in bed with his spouse. “Oh woooowww you must be SO happy good for you woooowwww.” \n\nI trust my spouse 100%. He did everything he “should” have in this situation, he was completely transparent and there is zero reason for me to believe this was anything other than the fact she was shooting her shot and missed. Instead of exiting with grace and apologizing for interrupting, she acted like a total asshole and disrespectful toward him and myself. I do not know her. \n\nMy sister searched her on Instagram this morning and sure as shit, she’s married and her husband is out of town. We figured it out in one post. \n\nI’m fucking livid. I have a really shitty relationship history (ex husband had an affair), and because of this, my spouse and I have worked SO hard to build a strong, trusting foundation. We proactively go to couples therapy to ensure we are on our A game. We and I work really hard so my past doesn’t creep into my present. This relationship is so meaningful to both of us and we work SO hard on it. My spouse has never done anything to break my trust. \n\nThis was incredibly triggering for me because of my past. I know my spouse isn’t cheating. I know this. But because I am triggered, I have an urge to reach out to her husband to let him know what she’s up to while he’s out of town. \n\nI know this will only end up in a mess, but I’m legit pissed right off. So many people knew my ex husband was acting like a clown while we were married, and no one told me. I feel sick for this woman’s husband, as I’ve been in his shoes.\n\nI have ZERO tolerance for people dumping their trash on my property, and this hoe interrupted my Netflix binge with my spouse.\n\n**Should I tell her husband?**\n\nTLDR: drunk married hoe tried to booty call my bf. He shot her down, she got even more obnoxious and now I want to rat her hoe ass out to her husband.",

Whenever she had a boyfriend they were joined at the hip but when you’d ask her for a girls night she was great about it. We had no issues meeting up for dinners, drinks, nights out, movie nights without the men in our lives, just us two catching up.\n\nHowever now that she is with a woman.. that is no longer the case. Several times we have made plans where I thought it was going to be just us and Pat shows up beside her. \n\nI’ve said things like “oh I thought it was going to be just us” and Cindy will ask if there’s an issue and I say of course not….I want to add I love pat and have no issue with her, I just miss my one on one time with my friend.\n\nCindy has made some comments that she’s so glad she’s finally been able to come out and be herself and how great it is that since pat is a woman she can bring her along on events that are “just the girls” and doesn’t have to leave her out. \n\nSince I’ve pushed for some more “just me and Cindy” time…. Cindy has increasingly distanced herself and I notice pat is a bit standoffish as well (I texted her happy birthday which went un acknowledged, perhaps an oversight if she was flooded with messages that day).\n\nI’m starting to suspect Cindy and Pat just never want to be apart and the more I push for it the more Cindy is going to pull away from me bc it’s not what she wants.\n\nAm I wrong in thinking there’s times you should be able to hangout with girlfriends without their partners, whether male or female? \n\nWe never had this issue when Cindy was heterosexual so I’m just very confused.",

I had an emotionally neglectful (and sometimes abusive)  upbringing and have had two toxic romantic relation/situationships.  Began to have some awareness for my issues at 25 and since then have  been trying to do yoga regularly and learn to be content/happy on my  own. I am also in a demanding career and need to self-study outside work  on some days.\n\nDue to my current  less-than-ideal personal situation, I really just want to focus on  myself and continue to pour most of my energy into my healing/growth.  From what I can see here a lot of people are actively dating over 30. Do  you think it's OK for me to spend my late-20s focusing on myself? Many  people have told me otherwise (\"You will regret later if you don't start  now\" ; \"Just try to put yourself out there and gain more experience!  You need to step out of your comfort zone\" ; \"Experience is everything.  Gain more experience!\" ). I know they are well intentioned, and  admittedly I don't really have much experience or know much about men.\n\nI find myself quite anxious/insecure over the idea of dating, and just want to have a few pointers!

I can share a few of my own to start-\n\n1) Controlling relationships - my boyfriend would tell me I sounded overly excited when I was on the phone with my dad, saying that I sounded childish and “desperate for attention.” This made me feel embarrassed and eventually resulted in reduced phone calls with my dad. \n\n2) Controlling hobbies - he would “tease” me so much about the “dumb” shows I watched to unwind that I felt embarrassed watching them, even when he wasn’t around. \n\n3) Controlling food - he would complain that the food I was making smelled bad (it was plain chicken) or that I was “drinking too much milk.” This one was so ridiculous to me it didn’t have much of an impact. \n\n4) Controlling time - he would always ask how long things would take or what time I would be ready, in the most inconsequential of situations. We wouldn’t have plans but he’d want to know how long my phone call or trip to the cafe would be. Or it would be a weekend but he’d want me to tell him the exact time I planned to go to bed.

To me this is the red flag of all red flags, but the thing is, he doesn't seem to hold any of the typical misogynistic \"Alpha Male\" beliefs - he's genuinely a feminist, he champions women's rights, is passionate about abortion access, and brings attention to Sexual Assault issues on social media. He \"gets it\" and is worldly/cultured. He just seems to think Alpha Male means masculine and kept bringing it up on this date.\n\nOther red flags: Is a (bad) tiktok rapper and may be secretly unemployed, says he supports trans people but that \"feminine men\" are becoming too normalized, believes that alpha males are under attack in society, seems insecure in his masculinity\n\nI really really loved our connection though, and we had such a beautiful whirlwind romance these past few weeks. At times, it even made me cry from how well we connected and how much he \"got\" me.\n\nWhat if I'm throwing away a good guy who just got some bad talking points? \n\nIf not, can someone please knock some sense into me?

I first came to the US for grad school (was at the height of mental health struggles) and a mess JUST before the pandemic which exacerbated it. I dated around a fair bit in a major city and met a man (he's white and 11years older) when I was 25. It was....bad and also good. But mostly bad.I blocked the guy, managed to get a job with just 20 days left on my visa and moved out of the city.   \n\n\nI worked on my trauma, on wanting to d\\*e all the time, and my alcoholism which I'd developed as a result. I went to AA and got sober, took my meds, dragged myself to therapy, confronted discomfort and anxiety and just really.....began to love living. I love living alone, I have a wonderful set of friends who have my back, coping skills and just, bravery. I'm doing a great job at work just a few months in, deal with the occasional racism on the field well, and have hobbies, which I never had because I was drunk through most of life. \n\nBut. I am STUMPED on what I want from love or relationships. Those 2 years with that guy (also my first 2 years in the US in a PANDEMIC!) wrecked me, and it took a lot to build from it and confront my faults and codependencies. I have zero interest in pleasing or impressing anyone now, particularly men, I have rock solid boundaries (never had it before, and it's extremely new to me), and I walk away from what's not working or healthy for me. I know I can't do casual sex anymore, and I am TOTALLY happy being single. But I miss the intimacy, the comfort and the growth that comes from relationships SO MUCH. \n\nHowever, I am absolutely TERRIFIED of dating, and very averse to the apps. I am ALSO questioning. I am not sure if I like women but I'm starting to find myself deeply attracted to them and honestly think I expressed that I was probably gay to my mom as a kid. I'm also very very scared to think or confront that! Is that attraction because of my past or is this who I am? (I also grew up in a conservative, homophobic city)\n\nI adore men. Men are great, and I think I do still like them. But I feel like the only way I'm going to know or try exploring this would be by dating. I'm a very visibly Asian woman, this is a fairly white state, I've dealt with my share of white men fetishizing, and I want to try dating now, but I'm very scared of being vulnerable again. My self-esteem has never been better, but I shrivel up when I think of love, even as much as I want to.  \n\n\nSorry for the length, any advice would be great. I love this subreddit.",

        "text": "I took a weekend getaway to a city a few hours away. Booked an Airbnb for myself. I was feeling some sort of way last night and got on Bumble. I've only ever had one true one night stand but for some reason I felt like entertaining the idea. At first I was just looking for someone fun to talk to. Next thing I knew, I was video chatting with a guy. He invited me over. I'm visit a small town and he lives in the woods. I knew I wasn't a smart idea, but somehow the idea of doing this really appealed to me. I asked for his last name, he gave it to me. LinkedIn and house records matched up. Long story short, I ended up going to his house. I sent my location to two friends. I almost turned around when I got there but I did. Went inside, we had a drink and started kissing. Talked about consent and a safe word. I would prefer not to go into details, but basically he knew certain things I'm into and was very happy to give them to me (think BDSM/kink). He's extremely experienced and took things to a level I haven't had before. All things I've wanted and fantasized about. I didn't stop him, I never used the safe word, I mostly enjoyed it. We did not have intercourse, hands, oral, and toys only. \n\nHere's the thing. At one point, I sort of \"woke up\" and realized I was in the middle of nowhere with a stranger, letting him do things to me I've never even done with a close partner. I insisted on leaving. Driving back to my Airbnb, I felt disgusting. I was disgusted at myself for making such poor decisions and I felt like I was disgusting for letting a man do those things to me. I woke up this morning feeling even worse and have bruises all over my body as a reminder. \n\nI don't know how to feel about this. On one hand, I know that it was a decision I made and I consented. On the other hand, I feel like he pushed my boundaries and I should have stopped, let alone out myself in the position in the first place. Part of me wants to feel empowered and sexy. The other part feels slutty and abused. \n\nIf anyone has advice or a perspective, I would love to hear it. \n\nTLDR: Feeling conflicted about a kinky hookup.",

        "text": "Welcome to the first episode of reasons I’ve been ghosted, from a woman in her 30s with a successful career. \n\nI reached out to people I went in dates with to see where the f*** they disappeared to. These were my favorites. \n\n1. I didn’t have a Snapchat.\n    That’s my bad I should always have a Snapchat instead of the 20 other ways I have for somebody to communicate with me. \n\n2. I “make too much money” \n     That’s also my fault I should go back in time and chose another career that is less lucrative as to not offend anyone. \n\n3. I’ve never been married. \n    That’s also my bad, I should be divorced by now. \n\n4. I wear hair extensions. \n    Still my fault for wanting voluminous locks. I should just be natural “like the girls on Instagram” \n\n5. I don’t have enough Instagram followers \n    How dare I only accept and follow people I know or are getting to know. \n\n6. I have a shih tzu. \n    He is not a “real dog” and therefor is unloveable by men. \n\n7. I didn’t want to take shots on a date. \n    I’m not even sorry about this one. \n\n8. And to conclude todays episode… he found out that as a nurse, I in fact, did not want “to take care of him” \n\n*obviously my comments are all satire, but the reasons are very real and I hate dating*",
