        "text": "It seems like back during the 2012-2015 time period there seemed to be declining interest in space. The NASA website during that time period didn't have a showcase of a big inspiring human spaceflight program on it's front page.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140101010928/http://www.nasa.gov/\n\nAnd there was no demand by the public for the institution of another Apollo sized effort.\n\nHow did space travel and space exploration stop being exciting?\n\nAnd not only that I find it a little sad that there was nothing on TV with space travel in it until the very end of 2015.\n\nhttps://practicalfreespirit.com/2011/09/06/to-infinity-and-beyond/\n\nWhat happened? I ask this as a person who had a upper Middle Class American suburban upbringing who was often sheltered from the problems of the world.\n\nDid people become too enthralled by materialism as evidenced by the reality show boom of that time period?\n\nEven I fell victim to a vapid mindset. During the Summer before my first year of college I remember discovering Neil Degrasse Tyson and becoming excited by space exploration but sadly that interest would largely die out soon after. During my college years of the mid 2010s I was obsessed with \"Greek Life\" and vacations to Disney World. I thought office careers were the ultimate aspiration and that blue collar work was \"Work for other people\".\n\nWas it because of the 2008 financial crash that caused large portions of the popular to struggle even to this day?\n\nWere people too preoccupied by social politics? I remember being obsessed with the police brutality issue in 2015.\n\nI regret losing my interest in space. I really wished I have gone into engineering instead. My interest has been reignited thanks to checking out Apple TV during the quarantine of 2020 and the \"Crew Dragon\". My interest in sci fi has been rekindled.\n\nAs a 90s kid I was promised an amazing future but now I lament the state of America. It seems large parts of the population has embraced anti science as well as conspiratorial mindsets while the infrastructure has been falling apart.\n\nWhere did it all go wrong?",
