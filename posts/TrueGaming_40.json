        "text": "I think a lot about the borderline-scary fact that games get you to PLAY as SOMEONE, therefore enabling people to understand others—if the character is well-written/well-made—in ways unachievable in any other other artistic field. This is why I want to go into the field—to craft a mechanics system for a game series revolving around promoting understanding and nurturing of who each character is, and then just telling stories. Have the characters interact. Each have their own ‘classes’ and ‘abilities’ reflected by/based around their personalities. Maybe have them literally fight their demons or insecurities and make it an rpg. \n\nThe only issue is, I haven’t really had the ‘aha’ moment of how this system of mechanics would actually work in my head. I know what I want the end result to be, as you can tell, but not how to actually get there. I played the Octopath Traveler demo by Square Enix and saw the two new characters announced in the Nintendo Direct, both yesterday coincidentally, and so that reignited my pondering of this idea into high gear (side note: I LOVE the apothecary). Any thoughts on this anyone? I’ve gone way deeper into the kinds of characters there could be, and have many outlined, but I want to hear where other people think I could go with this, or, like I previously asked, how I could get there in terms of actual tangible game design mechanics? \n\nAnd anyone know of any other game that I could play to further explore or indulge these ideas of empathy and connection with characters and their paths? Since like I said the Octopath Traveler demo gave me fun new data to ponder and mess around with in my thoughts. I’ve been told to pick up the Mass Effect series, but is that a good one for this concept? \n\nThanks y’all! For even taking the time to read, and especially if you take the time to indulge my passion and respond. ",

        "text": "I’ve always had problems connecting to BioWare games. I enjoyed ME1, then despised 2 and 3, thought KOTOR was okay but loved 2, and absolutely hated all of the Baldur’s Gate games.\n\nSo, I was cautious going into Dragon Age, because I didn’t want to be disappointed by it. And at first, I thought “hey, this is really good!” But then, it was a few hours later, I had reached the Fade area of the Mage’s Tower, and I realized that I couldn’t stand this game for a second longer.\n\nI want to try to codify my problems here, and I’m hoping you guys can help me get back into it.\n\n**The Origins**\n\nSo at first, my big problem with the game was the ridiculously restrictive character creation. I was especially disappointed with the inability to create a Dwarven mage, because I’ve always been a fan of that specific race.\n\nThe big draw to this game for me was the Origins System, so I was disappointed to discover that it was less a role-play element and more in line with a character select. All of the Origins come pre-loaded with character motivation and relationships, which is something I’m against in player character RPG’s. All of the Origins railroad you into being a Grey Warden, which is also upsetting. Like, in Pillars of Eternity, you have to become a Watcher, but that’s a matter of circumstance, where here, your character makes dumbass decisions that you often don’t get a choice in (the friend from the wild elf origin comes to mind here.)\n\nI ended up settling on Dwarven Noble because I thought hey, I like dwarves and maybe I get to be a king at the end. It also seemed to me like the most free of the origins for RP.\n\n**The Story\n\nMy first problem with the story is the dialogue. Lots of it is bland Fantasy fare (is that a *fantasy buzzword?* wow you’re a *fantasy knight* for real! Look out, its the *bad guy race!*) but then there’s the parts where they try to be funny, and they’re just so goddamn sure of themselves and the jokes all suck so bad. Alistar is the big offender here (That’s what I’m here for. To deliver unpleasant news and witty one-liners *laugh track*)\n\nThe world being built here is by far one of the most generic fantasy worlds... ever. At first I though The Fade might be cool because it’s made out of human perception and emotion, that could be creati- nope, it’s just walls and blur effect and the demons are all normal evil demons.\n\nI also don’t like the companions, one of the things that everyone likes about BioWare’s games. Mass Effect and KOTOR was great at this, but what the hell happened here? My favorites so far are Wynn, Shen, and the Bard lady because they aren’t annoying like Alistair and Morrigan, but they sure are boring.\n\n**The Gameplay**\n\nWhat the hell even happened here. What the fuck.\n\nSo the game is like some unholy mix between Final Fantasy XII and Baldur’s Gate. It didn’t have to be bad, but it sure... is.\n\nThe thing that gets me the most is how finicky the characters are to control in combat. I select for my guy to attack a dark spawn, and he does a goddamn ballet around him before he finally starts attacking. Characters move on to fight other enemies before they finish killing the enemies they’re supposed to be fighting. Sometimes if I switch targets after selecting abilities it’s used on the new target but other times it’s not.\n\nAnd the encounters and enemies are so badly done. There’s no clever design here, it’s just endless walls of enemies being thrown at you. The big enemies like the revenants and the ogres are especially terrible, essentially being brick walls that you attack. Brick wall is a good description for most of the combat here, it seems.\n\n**The Presentation.**\n\nIt’s BioWare, they always sucked at graphics, and they suck here.\n\n**Should I keep going?**\n\nI do WANT to finish this game. The story is generic, but I do find myself compelled to at least find out how my character turns out. Is it worth it for me to keep doing this?",

However, where *Advent Rising* excels in the extraordinary powers such as telekinesis, slow down time, launch projectiles at temperatures close to absolute zero or raise a shield, as they are varied and effective, like *The Force Unleashed* but better designed and without lightsaber:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEeL6owUUr4\n\nGames focused on extraordinary powers are scarce recently. *Dishonored* and *Prey* are not focused on powers because they can be beaten (with some exception in *Dishonored*) without using powers. I can think of *Infamous, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Prototype, The Witcher 3* and *Quantum Break* but the first two are RPGs and they have not become popular because of their powers and the third one is focused on the powers, but only to complement the firearms. Unlike *Advent Rising*, where powers quickly outweigh the firearms. *Infamous, Prototype* and *The Force Unleashed* are focused on powers, but they are not recent and \nthere is an lack of recent games that have tried to imitate them.\n\nAn *Advent Rising* trilogy was planned but it was canceled. So, would you like the trilogy to continue, although this is very unlikely? Or what seems most likely: a game that has another story but with very similar powers? And what powers would you like it to have?",

        "text": "NightDive Studios re-released Turok 1 and 2 on the Xbox One last week, so I decided to dive back into what was easily my favorite N64 shooter, specifically Turok 1. \n\nI was about 5/6 years old when I first played Turok and I distinctly remember the game giving me a feeling of anxiety and dread. I inched through every level, terrified at what was around every corner. I resorted to cheats just travel between worlds, because the maps were too labyrinthine for my young mind to figure out. And ultimately I never finished the game because of that. I played the game for hours and hours and never truly finished it. \n\nNow, if you've played Turok, or really any N64 game with large open areas you know how debilitating the fog was. Fog masked the low draw distance of the game and was purely there for technical reasons. But you don't think about that when you're 6 years old. So I took my time and worked through the fog bit by bit not knowing what would emerge. Combine that with the low bass-y drumbeats of the soundtrack mixed with the terrifyingly loud thumping footsteps of a velociraptor stalking nearby just out of sight and you could imagine how nerve-wracking of an experience it was for a child. Not to mention the fact that enemies had fairly short respawn timers, so you were never truly safe and could be attacked from behind at any moment by an enemy you killed 30 seconds ago. It was stressful and tense, but I loved every minute of it. I played the game on and off for years, never able to complete it.\n\nThis weekend I beat the re-release in ~5 hours. It took me 17 years but I finally realized that Turok was a run and gun strafe shooter. The re-releases extend the draw distance so you don't need to fear the unknown anymore. The respawning enemies encourage the player to keep moving so you don't flanked. Playing the game with stereo headphones means the thumping of enemy footsteps gives you situational awareness instead of being a terrifying reminder of what's beyond the fog or behind you. The levels, while still labyrinthine, are pretty cleverly designed and intuitive (except the catacombs, fuck that level) and it's tons of fun to explore and discover secret rooms. And of course, having 2 thumbsticks means I can actually HIT enemies instead of spraying and praying.\n\nI was sprinting through every level, blowing away hordes of enemies with my explosive shotgun and jumping headfirst into lava pits to find secret areas, where as 17 years ago I would have been slowly creeping through each cave, heart pounding, waiting for a leaper to jump out of the fog and fuck my shit.\n \nI just wanted to share my experience with the re-release. It's incredible how the lack of fog and updated controls completely changed the genre for me from a scary slow paced intense shooter to a run 'n' gun over-the-top FPS like DOOM. I understand that the game was always intended to be played as the latter, and I'm sure most people played the game like that, but I genuinely enjoyed playing through the game slowly and methodically as a child even if it was the 'wrong' way to play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^Now ^that ^DOOM ^2016 ^brought ^the ^old-school ^run ^'n' ^gun ^FPS ^genre ^back ^into ^the ^mainstream, ^maybe ^we ^can ^get ^a ^Turok ^reboot? ^Pretty ^please...",

Specifically, I think of the Infamous series and Sunset Overdrive, which takes the city-based parkour platforming to the next level while encouraging combat while moving. You can grind and bounce off just about anything and you have an air dash. Time slows down when you aim while moving. Infamous only does that while you are using the equivalent of a sniper rifle. Overwatch also has quite a few characters that can also move around the maps in different ways.\n\nBut at the same time, Prototype 1/2 feel like a clownshow, where you can just run up any building at any point in time. There's no finesse to moving around this way. Which I think Neon is my least favorite power and evil smoke is my favorite in inFamous Second Son.\n\nAnother thing to mention is that games like Mirror's Edge and Dying Light feel a little too slow as you are a normal person, and not someone with superpowers/abilities. I can't think of other first person games that come close to this feeling.\n\nI'm kind of rambling at this point.\nCan anyone provide other examples of this kind of gameplay?",

I only have time to play a few hours a day after work, but I meticulously worked every advantage I could find and have concluded that on average, I'm capped out around a .33 k/d ratio, no matter what game. I know all the standard responses to this: practice, lean maps, good internet speed, good monitor, headphones, yada yada yada. I've done all of this, but what I'm starting to believe there's another phenomenon at work here. One would expect a fairly normal distribution of skill from the players online, but it seems more like someone has lopped off the bottom 80% of the skill curve and the only ones playing are the top 20%. I say this because while I haven't tested it, I would bet money that if I played with a thousand random people from the street, I'd destroy 90% of them. Hell, I play with \"non gamer\" friends now and then and no matter how hard they try, I completely kick their asses. Go online though and you'd think I was playing with my thumbs in my ass. I understand that there is always a hardcore element in every activity like this, but what the hell? If I want to play ping pong or football or any sporting activity, there are leagues of varying levels where I can play against people of my own caliber. But with gaming, it's like everyone who isn't ridiculously good just gave up and doesn't play. Anyone have any thoughtful insight on this?",

The 2nd video shows a lot of similarities to Assassin's creed crowd mechanics, first AC game released in 2007 and it's possible that's the reason Ubisoft pushed for a different gameplay in SC:C, all though that's just a guess and probably not the deciding factor. \n\nObviously SCC wouldn't just copy paste past splinter cell games but it would bring something as a natural progression to such games. Semi open map design with lot of variables and choice, ability to blend in a crowd to move that way. Splinter cell wouldn't work like an open world sandbox as those games always suffer from same problems, but more so like the hitman series, where there's a lot of civilians, lot of open areas to cross which would be very immersive yet action packed. It's a great concept that was sadly overlooked. In my opinion of course.\n\nIt's getting a bit difficult to find all the old videos but here are a few:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzVySazMVeY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js6BEF0WwMo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPeWpTW2qGM\n\n\nIf you find any other videos please share, feel free to voice your opinion.

        "text": "What I see happening at the moment with the recent pay to win and microtransactions is simply the result of the gaming industry becoming increasingly monetized. It is a immensely popular and rapidly growing entertainement niche that in the technological aid is no doubt a great investment for publishers and corporations.\n\nHerein I believe lies the problem. \n\nTo me it is inconcievable to imagine the amount of delegation, management and funding needed to develop a AAA game. Thousands of people, each with hundreds of ideas. A few managers and directors. And then the money men. The shareholders. The producers.\n\nI believe there is a massive disconnect between the development, the individual programmer or story writer trying to weave his or her dream into an experience, and the producers who have invested 10s of millions into the project, and need to make a profit.\n\nHumans wielding that much money want a 'safe' return, that is, they do not want to take a risk. So they see what is popular with consumers: they tell the studio they want that.\n\nSo we get another battle royale. Another survival - sandbox - co op - crafting simulator. But no risk. No innovation. No new ideas, because that would be a risk, and thus money could be lost.\n\nThis is the fatal flaw I see in mainstream gaming, and the reason why despite the millions of wonderful ideas in capable heads, it is so rare for a game that attempts something new.\n\nBut what I believe most publishers fail to understand is that gamers will not buy the same thing forever. Yet the industry is still contiously growing, and thus as money and investment increases, risk and creativity decreases. This is what I think will happen until these companies and franchises become too rich to succeed, too bloated for cohesion.\n\nSo I believe large companies will crumble under their own weight and simply deliver products that are too safe and generic to make enough money. \n\nThen, the indie companies will shine. Clever, compact ideas with a small dynamic team and the focus on creation, not financial compensation. I believe these companies will grow into the new giants. \n\n(and too be honest the whole cycle will happen again, but only in a while.)\n\nTL;DR: Large companies are getting too money fat to risk creativity, their product stagnation will lead to collapse, indie companies will become the new big boys.

        "text": "Hey there!\n\nSo I was watching this [excellent breakdown and analysis of FEAR 2 Project Origin and why it is so poorly regarded by fans of the series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2v13OD6O-o) and there's a segment at [9 minutes 39 seconds](https://youtu.be/V2v13OD6O-o?t=9m39s) where he talks about how FEAR 2's shift to Aim Down Sights really hurt the gunplay.\n\nIn short, he argues that Aim Down Sights forces players to play in a more slow, cautious, easier playstyle which largely goes against FEAR 1's visceral hip/blind fire chaotic gunplay that made the game a critical hit. The reasons for why the shift probably stem from the decision to move to consoles and probably to compete with COD and not seem 'old school'.\n\nBut yeah, it got me thinking about shooters and how so many modern shooters have you just looking down the ACOG, Reflex Sights, Iron Sights, etc., moving at a snail's pace or just hiding behind cover for most of the combat engagements. Rarely do you ever have to spray and pray or get up close and flank the enemies like you do in FEAR 1 or Doom 2016. I don't know if I should include Wolfenstein TNO as a Hip Fire or ADS game because from my experience, i couldn't tell what it wanted to be. Hip fire drained too much of your ammo and i swear you never had enough ammo for your guns (and picking up ammo was like 10+ ammo per pickup...), while ADS really made the game play like a typical shooter. \n\nThe video made me remember how I actually always loved turning off Crosshairs in Call of Duty (before MW2 prevented you from turning crosshairs off even in Single Player) so I would not only get a more immersive experience but I also played the older CODs in a hip fire fashion because even as a kid I thought the ADS felt 'unrealistic' and too easy. I liked the chaotic firefights where i'm unloading magazines hoping to hit the enemy instead of having perfect accuracy picking off enemies one by one with ADS.\n\nThat's not to say I don't think ADS has a place in gaming. I think it definitely works for games that have large open expansive settings like Arma 3, Squad, Red Orchestra, etc. where accuracy, ammo conservation, distance, and your stance matters. But even in those games just lining up your sights on the enemy hundreds of meters away isn't a guaranteed kill because bullet drop off and other factors. Meanwhile in COD and co. shooters your accuracy is almost always pinpoint on the bullseye at every range. And while it allows players to engage the enemy at every distance with the same accuracy, it also sacrifices that movement, forcing you to play cautiously, getting behind cover, picking off the enemy.\n\nI think Brothers in Arms, no not the console one which I still rather liked, managed to have Hip Fire and ADS work in sync. The game was known for his enemy suppression system where you could force the enemy ducking behind cover if you laid down enough fire on them, allowing you to get around and flank. You could sit behind cover and try to pick off the enemy with your rifle at a distance with ADS (but even with ADS it wasn't as accurate as COD or even BiA Hell's Highway. This was mainly because the recoil was so violent a single shot would off balance your aim significantly during ADS. A nice trade off I think. Accuracy at the cost of temporary recoil and vision), or you could use either hip fire or ADS to suppress the enemy from afar, use that moment while they're suppressed, and flank them from the sides or rear, using hip fire or ADS.\n\nI would love to talk about how I feel [Rainbow Six Siege seems to rely too much on ADS (which is a bit too effective imo)](https://youtu.be/sboEJNb1En4) or how I feel Fallout 3's Zoom In mode felt more appropriate than New Vegas' iron sights which felt jarring due to the RPG gunplay and much more other examples but for now I think I covered my thoughts on Hip Fire or ADS and it makes me somewhat sad that very few games promote Hip Fire combat over ADS which has arguably made most shooters too methodical, cautious, and uninteresting because of the increased accuracy and slowed down movement.\n\nWhat do you think about the two? Do you prefer one or the other? Do you think more games should take the hip fire, Doom 2016, FEAR 1 approach or are things fine the way it is right now? Also feel free to make suggestions to maybe fix ADS if you want.",

        "text": "I remember a long time ago I booted up Fable for the first time, which for me was the first game I played that emphasized choice. You could follow the path of good, or the path of evil. I remember being really enamored with the game, and of course being a kid I chose to go with good. I kept playing games like KOTOR and Mass Effect and I always chose the 'good' path.\n\nAs I grew older, I found that I wanted to try a going 'evil' in games. However, as I soon began to find out, the 'evil' paths weren't nearly as fulfilling. You couldn't really get engaged with the game, as a lot of the choices you made were just comically evil. You didn't feel an attachment to your character, and you really didn't feel any desire to keep going the 'evil' route unless you had already beaten the game on the 'good' path and just wanted to see what happened on the other side. I usually stopped playing the evil path pretty early in a game, as it just felt like there was no purpose to slaughter these guys, but that was the evil path. That's where the problem set in, and where I started to realize that in many  'choice driven' games, you don't really have a choice.\n\nIt goes beyond the good and evil aspect too. It seems like a lot of games allow you to 'choose' play styles, but through narrative emphasizes one over the other. A common example is non-lethal stealth or lethal combat play styles. The game has two ways of tackling a mission, but you better not choose lethal combat, or you get the 'bad' ending. I've been told it's a way to 'reward' the players that go stealth. Here's the thing: gameplay should be the reason you play a play style. If you like stealth, go stealth, if you like combat, go combat. A game shouldn't punish you for enjoying a play style better.\n\nIt's the primary reason I haven't played Dishonored. I know from articles and word of mouth that the game basically boils down to sneaking around the map avoiding conflict. The game gives you abilities and cool powers that work and feel great in combat, but the second you use them you're setting yourself up for a poor and unfulfilling story arc and to be condescendingly told by the game that you're bad. I get it, I'm not killing people to be the good guy, but there have been plenty of 'end justifies the means' situations in history. Make me feel like my character is a real person with motivations who did what he thought was right, not some comically evil person with no attachments.\n\nSome great examples of games that actually offer choice: Metal Gear Solid 5. Most games make stealth the only way to get the highest ranking on a map. Not MGSV. You can got combat, loud as hell, and still get an S ranking on a mission. You have to move fast though, and you should try for headshots. It's not easy, and it's fun. Hideo knew that what players wanted is actual choice in gameplay. The people who actually like stealth, you can get an S ranking going that direction too. The key is that if you go half and half and haphazardly flow through the mission, you get a low ranking. You better be prepared for your play style. Going into a mission without a plan is going to get you a low ranking.\n\nNeverwinter Nights Hordes of the Underdark also made a fulfilling story from multiple angles. Looking back it seemed like you had so many options as to how you wanted your character's endgame to work. You could even skip the final boss if you set things up right. And you know what? It didn't feel like you missed out if you got a certain ending. Just play your character. Stop looking at guides to get \"the best ending\" and just play your character. All the endings are great. That's how games should be.\n\nI wrote this because I loaded up Mankind Divided for the first time today, and the game asks you on the first mission if you want to go lethal or non lethal. I know if I chose lethal, the play style I want, that game is going to do it's best to make me feel bad about choosing that play style. So I have to go non-lethal, and yawn for hours as I force myself to finish my play-through.\n\nMy overall point is that I shouldn't have to stop and think about what choices the devs want me to go down to reveal their 'best' or secret ending. I should just be able to play a game and make the choices that I think my character would make. I should be able to play and enjoy ANY play style the game has set up, and the game shouldn't punish me for picking it.\n\n",

        "text": "The Silent Hill series has always done a great job of capitalizing on the fear of the unknown and the need for connection. Most games distinctly want you to fear something they throw at you. Something known. Whereas Silent Hill wants to isolate you and then scare you. Then isolate you. Then scare you....Let me explain.\n\nLet's look at Silent Hill 2 (before i begin though, there is a lot to be said of the symbolism and general narrative brilliance behind this game, but I just want to talk about why it's widely regarded as the most terrifying entry in the series and also in gaming as a whole). One of the most terrifying parts of Silent Hill 2 is the radio. This is because it taps into the primal fear of the unknown in a profound way. Instead of having a distinct growling noise, and a shape, we instead have an uncomfortable noise that lets you know something that is somewhere wants to kill you. It hides the danger behind a wall, thus increasing it's potency. Most people won't say they are scared of the dark, bu they have a very good reason to be. It's a survival mechanism. And everything in the game is designed to play off of that trait. To keep you wondering what is coming. The radio static. The fog. The darkness. And doors...\n\nSee doors play a special role in Silent Hill. You ever notice the sound of a door opening is louder than most of the other sounds? And creeeeaaaky? That's because it's meant to ratchet up that tension of finding out what is on the other side. It is very much a trigger, like Pavlov's dogs. It's meant to create a primal fear instinct in you because of the tonal quality's the sound possesses and the fear of the unknown. It was honestly one of the worst things for me about that game. Humans don't like high pitched noises and low growling noises because those noises make us realize that danger is close – bugs and things that poison us and things that want to eat us respectively. That's why most people don't like creaky floorboards or squeaky hinges. It reminds us on a primal level of death. Just listen to the music that Akira Yamaoka created for the game. It's all highs, lows and industrial noises. Because even the music plays on your fears of unknown dangers. Just like when you move into a new level of the apartment, the music changes. A dull silence turns into an industrial growl....and you're left wondering: Why did the music change?\n\nWhich brings us to “Isolation”. True Isolation for a human isn't just being alone. It's being alone without anyone or anything that makes you feel like you aren't alone. Even reading books or having a dog can help someone not feel alone. True solitude destroys the mind. That is why Silent Hill is so interesting. So let's go back to the music. Most of us are familiar with music that originates from our own countries. Whether it be the ancient Chinese flutes like the dizi, Indonesian gamelan, African djembe or a western violin or piano. These sounds come from nature. They are familiar to us. So when you hear them in a film or game, they ground you. They make you feel comfortable. Just look at any good horror soundtrack, they'll always have something like this...[notice anything familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6CaTL29_FQ)? The music is part of this grand tapestry designed to make you feel more alone.\n\nEverything is designed to. Even the people. You notice that? Every person you meet is almost normal...but then they turn into something else. See people can acclimate to pretty much any situation given enough time. But Silent Hill makes that process as hard as possible. Afterall, not having something isn't as hard as having something and losing it. So the game isolates you further by giving you what seems to be human interaction but corrupting it. The woman in the graveyard is at first normal...and then isn't. Eddie - existing without fear in a land of monsters...even your wife who isn't you're wife. The one thing that couldn't possibly make you feel more alone, your wife – the entire reason you even came to Silent Hill – makes you feel even more alone than you did before you found her. Even the man you find in the room in the apartment. He's dead. And you're left wondering who he was. Why he's dead. And dammit....why couldn't I have had someone here to talk to for once. \n\nSee. The scariest thing about Silent Hill isn't that it's filled with monsters. It's that it is almost familiar. The boring town. The normal looking fog. The living manikins. Your wife.....Everything is designed to almost give you comfort and then take it away. The manikins aren't monsters. Nor are the nurses. They're corruptions of what is normal to you. What is safe and comforting. All in an effort to push you into your head. Because no one likes to be inside their own head for too long. Your head, afterall, is the scariest thing about a human. Think too much about stuff and it will drive you mad. And all the most heinous travesties ever perpetuated came from someones head afterall. And the most terrifying things that you could experience don't exist anywhere else....\n\nThat's why it's so brilliant. It takes everything about a horror game and makes it more about you than you realize. All in an effort you make you feel so alone that fear is the only thing you can feel...even if you don't know why.\n\nEdit: I think that may be why Survival Horror games have puzzles. They're just another way to make the player not understand what is happening. Another type of horror that is briefly abated but ultimately compounded.\n\nEdit 2: I'm still excited for \"Visage\" but I feel like they miss some of these points that make Silent Hill great. ",

Emily could have had better stealth capabilities than Corvo thanks to her smaller size and be able to sneak trough openings to small for Corvo to enter. But at the cost of having less physical strength making her inventory smaller and being unable to carry dead or unconscious NPCs on her back.\n\nIn Prey it was like 'why even bother'? Just decide on a male or female protagonist and be done with it, don't make me choose if my choice of character is meaningless. Then it is a gimmick rather than a feature.",

That is why each and every big game publisher has now their own competitive shooter.\n\nProblem is, when every publisher makes the same kind of game, you find yourself with money making machines with no soul.\n\nMy fav example are competitive shooters and their skins, but it applies to MOBA's or sports game too. The game becomes a platform to make money, it's content being tailored into making us feel the urge to buy for some reason. \n\n",

When I play these games, all I can think about is that they would be better as either just pure turn based rpgs or action rpgs. They try to incorporate things like positioning and movement, but these are things action rpgs do better and more naturally. Even though it feels like you should be able to dodge attacks, you can't actually do that, or at the very least if you can the method is very poor in comparison. They try to incorporate a party, but these are things once again done better in turn based rpg because you get direct control over everyone. Plus they feel a bit too auto-piloted. Almost like they are very simple RTS's or something. Xenoblade tries to avoid this by introducing a bunch of gimmicky commands and timings, but it just makes you once again wonder...why isn't this game just an action rpg if skill is going to be a factor?  \n\nI get why this system is used in an MMO. They want to keep the non-reflex based battle system but don't want to bog down the pace with a pure turn based battle system (as a bunch of players all selecting turns individually would turn into a mess). But as for single player games I'm still finding it to be the weakest of the three other options available (traditional, strategy and action).\n\nFunny enough MOBA's sorta use an auto-attack system like these games, but for some reason it works better. Not sure what the difference is there. \n\n",

At least this is how I felt about it.\n\nRecently I started *Chrono Trigger* for the first time in my life. I got hold of the Strategy Guide and being used to it as a kid I started playing with the book open. But then it struck me. It felt like a mere Walkthrough, not like 'research' or using a map. It never felt to me like this as a kid.\n\nYesterday I started playing without the guide, and everything was a bit more rewarding, I had a sense of accomplishment and was tied more closely to the story, because I had to read closely and think more.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/817ha3/what_do_you_think_of_weapon_degradation_in_games/",
        "text": "Recently, I’ve been playing a lot of Dying Light, but within the first quarter of the game I’d downloaded a mod to mess with the durability system so that each weapon can be repaired an infinite number of times. I prefer this over simply having weapons not break because I think, in this game, the chance of your weapon breaking adds some suspense to combat. Overall, though, I don’t think weapon degradation is a good thing in games. Using Dying Light as an example, it seems that the whole point of the system is to keep me from settling on one weapon I like and using it forever. Each weapon can only be repaired a fixed amount of times, so once you’ve used up those repairs, if it breaks again it’s broken. The item used for repairs in Dying Light, Metal Parts, is so incredibly common that after beating the game and running around for a bit, I’m sitting on more than 300 of them. Metal Parts can be obtained through scavenging, or by breaking down (presumably old) weapons. So right before your weapon breaks for a final time, you change it into a Metal Parts to repair whichever one you pick up next the first time it breaks.\n\n\nHowever, the whole point of Dying Light’s weapon system is that weapons are randomly generated. So the random stats cause me to switch from weapon to weapon as I find one with better stats anyway, and they’re so easy to find that even before I added the mod onto my game I always had serviceable weapons and was constantly discarding my old ones before the durability system even mattered. So as a way to keep the player from sitting on one weapon the entire game, it’s wholly unnecessary. All the system really did was keep me using my weakest weapon all the time, forcing me to play suboptimally in order to protect whatever my best weapon was at the time, only for it to be outclassed by the time I’d ever get to using it.\n\n\nAnother problem, besides the fact that it’s wholly unnecessary for its main purpose, is that the repairs system is heavily weighted against the player. At the beginning of the game, I was both picking up and dropping weapons like hotcakes because they broke (and used up all of the 2-3 repairs they were allotted) lightning quick. By the end of the game, I would’ve been hoarding powerful weapons that I would never use for fear of breaking the things. Even after all the upgrades I can get to make the system easier on me, weapons still break much more quickly that I would expect them to. A solid steel wrench is not going to fall apart from being bashed into a zombie skull 5 or 10 times, and a metal baseball bat certainly won’t. Very often, it served to kill my immersion rather than aid it.\n\n\nEven in other games, my experience with durability systems has been that they do nothing except keep the player from using the actual cool weapons. What do you guys think? Those of you who enjoy the durability systems, why? ",

        "author": "Renegade_Meister",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8169ow/does_increasing_nontraditional_game_monetization/",
        "text": "**TL;DR: Read questions in bold.** \n\nI can't help but wonder if additional monetization methods have:\n\n* Significantly impacted the social dynamics or standing of gamers within their communities, and\n\n* more strongly highlights economic differences between gamers\n\n...given that there are a lot more economic barriers to various game content: Pre-release access, pre-order editions, DLCs, subscriptions, season passes, in-game purchases (aka MTX), loot boxes, etc.\n\n**When these monetization methods exist in games, do they significantly change how gamers interact with one another?  Does this have more or less of an social impact than differences in hardware (e.g. older vs newer rig)?**  In otherwords, do monetization methods make the socioeconomic differences more prevalent between gamers?\n\nThis could look like a number of social dynamics, wherein X is a form of paid content:\n\n* Elitism (\"I have X and you don't\")\n\n* Social friction (lack of acceptance when player doesn't have X)\n\n* Social exclusion/barriers (lack of X prevents interaction with certain gamers or micro communities).\n\nI think the topic is important to discuss now that these monetization methods are permeating console, mainstream, and AAA games regardless of any initial game purchase cost.  As implied by a [discussion](https://np.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/80vrts/games_as_service_will_no_longer_be_games_they_are/) on this sub yesterday, gamers need to be able to voice the difference between games that are monetized differently (like \"[Live Services](https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/15/pc-gaming-weekly-the-live-services-blues/)\") and how they're treated differently by game publishers.  Also, I am curious about this topic since I am a PC gamer who rarely plays AAA, F2P, or online games who isn't socially active in gaming communities aside from Reddit.  To facilitate this discussion, I will **put questions in bold**, provide some examples in gaming to consider, and define some terms I'm using.\n\n# Terms I'll Use\n\nGamer Socioeconomic Status ([SES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status)): A total measure of a person's economic and social position in relation to others gamers.\n\nMicro Community: Any community formed around a game, part of a game, or even a specific piece of gaming hardware/software that is peripheral to a platform.\n\nMacro Community: Any community formed around a group of games, whether by genre or platform.\n\nMTX: Microtransactions\n\nPublisher: Whoever markets and monetizes the game, AAA or not.  May or may not be the same company as the game's developers.\n\n# Monetization Examples &amp; Additional Questions\n\n* Traditional game monetization: In order to consider how non-traditional game monetization can make Gamer SES more notable, let's review traditional game monetization.  The economic ability of a gamer to buy into platform(s) increases their social reach (and possibly social status) with macro communities, whereas as buying into a game was a binary choice that allows for joining micro communities - You owned &amp; played it, or you didn't.  This made the socioeconomic differences between players relatively simple and flat, aside from measuring it based on the number of sheer consoles &amp; games owned or perhaps whether players had the newest games or not.  Aside from its basic economic gates that I explained, **what are ways that traditional monetization contributes more positively or negatively to player social dynamics vs non-traditional if all else is constant?** (e.g. comparing monetization methods between games with the same core mechanics) \n\n* DLC: Whether for an offline or online game, **how often does DLC tend to fragment micro communities?**  Best case scenario here is if DLC adds content without significantly changing the existing story or gameplay.  If DLC makes any notable changes to story or gameplay, it could indirectly become socially exclusionary when it comes to discussing the game on forums, on voice chat, or with friends.  Worst case scenario is if DLC adds new game areas/modes that are considerably different from the base game and directly fragment the micro communities.\n\n* Pre-release access: When a game does this, the game's micro communities and social structure are created before it even exists.  **How often does elitism or social exclusion occur with pre vs post-release gamers?  How often do publishers enable this behavior?**  If a game provides certain exclusive benefits to purchasing certain pre-release packages (i.e. founders pack), these can come with certain perks that differentiate these players from others, and may even provide exclusive social channels until or beyond release.  Just one example: The highest tier of Warframe's founders pack included access to an exclusive forum and the privilege of voting on certain new things being considered for the game, and perhaps even more chat with the devs.\n\n* F2P/Games with MTX: One common dynamic of games with MTX, F2P or not, is that they often present the player the choice of working toward achieving characters/items vs directly/indirectly purchase via MTX.  This could create several different Gamer SESs: Gamers who have less items because they are less willing to grind or pay, gamers who are more willing to grind, gamers who are more willing to pay than grind.  **How often does the nature of F2P/MTX games cause more social division between players, if at all?**  I can *imagine* some degree of elitism from gamers who buy many of the popular items as they get released vs gamers who buy little to nothing &amp; are only willing to grind for select things.\n\n* Extreme online game monetization: Consider an AAA game with notable online experience, upfront AAA-like price, and all monetization methods listed earlier (perhaps except subscription).  **Are the social dynamics of extremely monetized games much different than games with fewer monetization methods?**  Considering all the different ways individual monetization methods create Gamer SESs, such a game would create a lot more chances for social divides, but I can't say I've played such a game for me personally to know the answer to this.",

Players always lean towards efficiency and if you give them a ton of quests to take on they will take on all of them at once and fill their quest log to the brim. Nobody does one quest at a time before accepting the next, that's not how most people are wired.  \n  \nBut then that becomes so overwhelming. When you're introduced to dozens of characters who all tell you their life story and then ask you a favor it's harder to keep the details straight in your head and being invested in their story when there's so many stories going on at once. And seeing a wall of quests on your journal while the game usually also bugs you to hurry up with the main quest can be really discouraging.   \n  \nIs there any way to \"fix\" this? I mean it makes complete sense that there's a lot of people in towns so you'll get lots of quests there, but it always feels wrong from a gameplay perspective to pack everything together so much in certain hubs.",

        "text": "-TLDR: Before we go all Genghis Khan on the gaming industry. Can we make sure we do some fact checks?\n\nThis has been bugging me so I just wanted to get it off my chest. I kind of don't like the direction we are going in tackling \"game gambling,\" specifically loot boxes. I feel people in power. Are just taking advantage of a situation of angry Star War fans because of the way EA has treated Star Wars Battlefront 2. Even though this has slowly been building up over time from the gaming industries milking tactics. The funny thing is the free market has already voted with their wallets and even made EA back track on some of their decisions.\n\nThere are several things to take into consideration when trying to resolve a problem. \n1st, you need to know what the problem is. \n2nd, what case study factually proves this will resolve the problem and is there any study that contradicts it?\n3rd, is this the best method to resolve the problem?\n4th, are we being consistent in all scenarios? \n\nLastly or possibly this part can be skipped, but it is very unlikely do to human nature, is the solution to resolving our problem moral? Reason why I would not include that is because we all have different moral values. Regardless it still should be worth talking about and always saving it for last. So nobody has the ability to bend the facts and narrative to fit their moral values.\n\nSo to answer step number 1. The problem people are having right now is that people are getting addicted to stuff like loot boxes and companies are taking advantage of them. Some of these people include children. So everyone wants to find a way to stop this. Before we go on, is there any actual proof that the majority of the population is getting addicted to loot boxes? For now I will assume yes so we can go onto the next steps.\n\nStep number 2. Politicians have suggested on classifying loot boxes as gambling, increasing regulation on games, and potientially charging a extra 10% tax on violent video games. That will go to helping the \"mental health and counseling resources in schools.\" http://gameranx.com/updates/id/140317/article/politician-proposes-a-tax-for-violent-videogames/\n\nI don't know of any politician in the recent months giving studies showing that these methods would resolve the problem. The reason why this is important is because we could potentially make our problems worse. If there is no case study and we just need to test out to see if these things will work. Why not start small? Have a vote amongst districts of a county. The districts with the most votes gets to be the guinea pig. Then after that do it with counties, then cities, then states, and if everything works out amazing. Do it for the entire country and even talk to the united nations of our great findings.\n\nStep number 3. Say that what has been stated in step number 2 actually resolves the problem. Is it actually the best method? Is leaving it up to the free market a better option? Such as giving consumers the option of buying the product. Even if a person buys a game they don't have to buy additional DLC for it.\n\nStep number 4. If we were going to assume step number 2 fixes the problem. Where does this leave trading card games? How about bosses and monsters that drops different random loot when you defeat them? What about those happy meals for kids at mcdonalds that come with a random toy? What about prizes and sweepstakes that companies always do?\n\nStep number 5. Is it moral to intervene and make companies do something through the force of government because \"we say so?\" IMHO it is immoral, but I rather do this one immoral thing if it means it helps our society and even said companies.\n\nI'm open for discussion, just don't be toxic. It is actually fun to have conversations. Feel free to share this wall of text on other websites. You don't have to credit me, I just want a discussion on this. If you do post this some where else. Can you PM me so I can see how everyone took it?\n\nPS \nI would also like to say Chris Lee. Is a good looking dude who also happens to be a gamer. I think people emotionally respond better to good looking humans, especially ones they can relate too. To me this negatively effects ones' rational way of thinking.",

        "title": "How I learned to stop worrying and love the Switch...",
        "author": "TornadoCreator",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/813qxr/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_the_switch/",
        "text": "I've probably been one of the Nintendo Switches biggest detractors. It's a system I was hoping would be the next big thing for me only to have it be a handheld with controls I don't like, terrible battery life, and a library of games that seemed laughable at best...\n\nNow my opinion has changed somewhat and I frankly love the Switch. Not for playing, I don't own one and I have no intention of picking one up... but for existing. The Switch has given me a few great things to consider as a gamer in my 30s and it makes me genuinely pleased that it exists. Here are my reasons.\n\n1. As a PS4 gamer, the Switch has put the breaks on the need to upgrade to 4k gaming. With the Xbox One X only managing mediocre sales and having zero exclusives, the need for PS4 to catch up and also make a 4k capable device isn't as strong as I expected. As I discussed in another thread, this means; because so many developers are making multiplatform games that are PS4/Switch (often missing out the Xbox One entirely), the PS4 will be getting high quality games running at 60 frames per second at 1080p, because the Switch is acting as a limiting factor. The PS4 is the more powerful system so it'll get the better versions, and as I rarely play outside anyway (and I have my Vita for that), I'll get the best experience possible.\n\n2. As a Vita gamer, the new Switch cases are delightfully useful. Seriously, I can fit a Vita, with a grip add on. A full charger with UK plug, and over 40 games (3x game case strips in the zip compartment containing 24 games, and 19 games in the pouches) into a single Switch case. This means my entire Vita collection can fit in a travel bag, with add ons. It's a silly thing to have come out of this system, but it's something that I've been enjoying for months now. It's genuinely useful.\n\n3. I love Nintendo games as much as the next guy; but with all the games coming out recently, I've not really had the time to play them all. While I've criticised the Switch for having no games, in reality what it has are no new games worth picking up... I've played Mario Odyssey on a friends Switch and frankly hated it. It's a busy-work filled collect-a-thon that took all the things about collect-a-thons I hate and dialled them up to eleven. But all the other big name games on the Switch are ports. 'Breath Of The Wild', 'Mario Kart 8', 'Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze', and 'Bayonetta 2', are all Wii U ports, which I already own while 'Skyrim', 'Dark Souls', 'Doom', 'Titan Quest', 'LA Noire' and 'Legend Of Kay' are all multi-platform ports I also already own (usually on PS3 or PS4). Sure, this is a great library of games at this point, but what does this mean for me? Well it means I don't really miss out on much. I already own these games so I'm free to tackle my PS4 backlog, safe in the knowledge that the 2018 and 2019 offerings from Nintendo are pretty much the same games I played back in 2014-2015 on the Wii U and PS3. I'm not missing out on much, and as daft as it sounds I hate missing out just because I'm in my 30's and lack the free time to just play video games 8 hours a day every day now.\n\n4. I still get to take part in the Switch discussions and now I have more people who can share my experience of Bayonetta 2, and Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze; two of my all time favourite games. (Hell, the Wii U holds more games on my top 10 all time games than any other system at this point). Being able to talk about how awesome these games are, and knowing more people will be able to experience them is cool. Here's hoping all you Switch owners get a port of Super Mario 3D World, it's genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. Made me feel like a kid again. Pure joy in gameplay.\n\n5. Indie games are getting even more exposure now, and they're getting more physical releases. I think the fact that the Switch is portable and lacks the ability to have multiple Terabytes of hard drive space is partially the reason for this. Games like 'Steamworld Dig 2', 'Owlboy', 'Axiom Verge', 'Wonder Boy: Dragon's Trap', 'Rime', 'The Binding Of Issac: Afterbirth', 'Slain: Back From Hell', 'Cave Story+', 'Shantae: Half Genie Hero', and 'Monster Boy &amp; The Cursed Kingdom' are all available physically on the Switch, and that's pretty damn cool; and with a limited game library people are giving these things a chance. It's bringing the 2D platformers and indie games into a second renaissance and that's no bad thing... And all these games are also physically available on PS4 too, (except 'Cave Story+' sadly), so I've got loads of short burst fun games to play, which is very fitting for my current style of play.\n\n6. And finally, the Switch is selling well (and will hopefully continue to do so). The Wii U did not... this means my Wii U games will likely be collectable, but in 5+ years Switch games will likely be quite cheap due to simple being plentiful. So come about 2025, I can pack up my Wii U, put it's collectable games on display, and pick up a Switch with a Pro Controller so I can still play all my favourites, only this time with added portability if I want that. Which means I don't need to worry as much about the prospect of my Wii U ever breaking and losing access to some of my favourite games.\n\nSo that's how I learned to stop worrying and love the Switch...\n\nHappy gaming guys. While I may dislike Mario Odyssey, and think Breath Of The Wild is severely overrated. I have to now admit. The Switch has over two dozen great games on it, physically released too (and as a game collector I appreciate this). It's a system well worth owning, ESPECIALLY if you don't own a PS4 or don't own a Wii U; and if you don't own either I could see it being a must-own system for many people.",

        "text": "I find it really ridiculous when people say games like PUBG etc are going to replace CS GO, CS GO is dead and PUBG is future etc. Well, to start, PUBG is already loosing that appeal already and it's not even a full year. And it was sure to happen because of inherent nature of the games of this genre. \n\nYou will probably relate to my theory as well. PUBG/Fortnite hook you initially because you play a game or two and get a particular rank. You get hooked because you have hope that trying again will get you a better rank next time. You are playing again and again not because you really like the game(some people may) but because you develop a kind of ego that you can do better than this next time. I have experienced it when i start playing score based game. Initially i may play it for fun but then i play because getting a higher score gives a sense of satisfaction though game itself may not be that much fun now.\n\nBut soon you realize it is not worth keep playing because you mind had become tired and you start thinking what i am achieving by spending all the time into it, just a score or a good rank. Moreover suppose you topped enough times you loose interest because there is nothing else left to achieve and getting top rank doesn't excites you anymore. \n\nAt other end games like CS GO have almost infinite skill ceiling. There is no particular high score to achieve. You are constantly being bettered by some other team or person and there is this 'skill' factor which keeps you engaged in game. That 'skill' level you achieve is a long lasting achievement. You are recognized by community, friends etc. \n\nSo that's what i think. ",

        "text": "Nowadays in mainstream RPGs, main plot line quests and side story missions are usually clearly labeled as such. The developers just has this expectation that there are designated quests that players would feel free to skip through, and so mostly contained within their own mini arcs. I feel by singling out “main quests” outright to players, it makes the narrative structure of games less natural. \n \nTake an example, The Witcher 3 is widely praised for it’s writing quality for quests, either main or optional. But since the location of next main plot point is always pinned on the map, I never really felt particularly clueless in my search for Ciri (which is at dissonance to the narrative); and I would do side quests at leisure, knowing for sure they won’t give me new information of Ciri’s whereabouts. The game just felt... game-y. \n  \nStill taking TW3, maybe it could tie everything to the main plot better, by making some adjustments and sprinkle some red herrings: \nLet Geralt ask “oh by the way, have any of you seen an ashen haired girl?” when collecting a contract bounty; \n \nLet the innkeeper comment how Geralt’s footwork in fistfights resembles “the sword girl who brawled here a month ago”; \n  \nLet Geralt’s heart skip a bit when he saw a familiar back view when rescuing children kidnapped by a monster, who turns out to be just another Cintrian girl; \n \netc, these are still side quests, but less unapologetically so.",

Hopefully a succinct term will catch on from the consumer side.\n   \nThis isn't a fight unique to the gaming community.

        "title": "Are multiplayer games art?",
        "author": "MalvolioTheMisguided",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/80qw1p/are_multiplayer_games_art/",
        "text": "So obviously single player games are art; any single player game can tell a story and convey emotion just as well as a film or a book. That debate is played out as far as I'm concerned. What interests me is that, in contrast to most other media, games seem to have two distinct aspects: the story, themes and basically anything that conveys meaning, and the gameplay itself, which can be completely separate from any artistic concerns. By gameplay I mean the visceral experience of interacting with the game. For example, in single player first person shooter, the actual experience of shooting your weapons could feel fun and rewarding, or awkward and unresponsive. While that may have an effect on the overall quality of the game, it will in most situations have no effect on the way the game creates meaning (besides perhaps getting in the way of it). Mechanics are certainly used to affect meaning, especially in more experimental titles, but my point is that they aren't fundamentally connected. The traditional corridor shooter, for example, is pure, shooting gallery gameplay interspersed with a story told through cut-scenes.\n\nSo how does this relate to multiplayer games? Well, in most cases multiplayer games are pure gameplay with very little concern for story or meaning. In counter strike, for example, all decisions pertaining to the game are subordinate to creating fun, fair gameplay. This extends to the visual design and believability of maps, the weapon design and the character design. It is essentially only gameplay and makes no effort to express anything. Most multiplayer games are basically sports before anything else, which makes it difficult to classify them as art. Sure, you could call sports an art form just as you might refer to 'the art of cooking' but in my opinion these are unhelpful over generalizations and, as far as I am aware, not generally recognized by the academic community.\n\nSo maybe multiplayer games are not art. Perhaps that seems obvious, but it has some slightly troubling implications. For one, films and books are arguably inherently artistic, which means games are in some way quite different from other art forms. It also implies that gameplay, one of the most fundamental differences between games and other media, is not inherently 'artistic' when taken out of the context of story or atmosphere. This is especially troublesome when you consider that the difference between pure single player and pure multiplayer isn't necessarily binary. What about MMOs, where there is a story, but it seems like mechanics and human interactions are often prioritized? What about coop shooters like left for dead, where there is a linear story, but characterization is deliberately simplified so that new players can easily be transplanted onto their randomly assigned avatars?\n\nOverall, it seems problematic that, in contrast to other media, pure gameplay does not seem to have inherent artistic value and so it is arguably not a given that games are art. In other words games can be both art and sport while that is not the case for films or books. There are some obvious counter examples to this, like non-fiction books, but it seems like the mutiplayer games and single player games are generally lumped together, while the categorisation 'novel' excludes works without artistic qualities. Perhaps it is time for the broader designations of fiction and non-fiction games? Anyway, what do you guys have to say about this?\n\n\nTL;DR: Games can be art, but multiplayer games can easily lack any clear artistic properties, and this sort of muddies the water.",

        "text": "TLDR: I'd rather my games don't involve real money, but if business are gonna head that way and people are gonna Pay2Win legally or not, I'd rather have auction houses than microtransactions. What I don't understand is why business prefer MTX over auction houses.\n\nI know this is going to be a bit controversial. Officially sanctioned RMT was a topic of debate back then, and still is now. But think about it. If companies are gonna get greedy and go for that whale money anyway, why not do it in a way that is no more harmful to what it already was, in a way that more parties can be happy? \n\nReal money auction houses sound pretty bad, but RMT is going to happen anyway, whether officially or unofficially, whether legally or illegally. Just like how we treat drugs, why not legalise and tax them? It's not the fairest but it might be the necessary evil.\n\nOn top of that, doesn't an auction house offer everything microtransactions can do while also providing incentives for non-paying players to stay with the game and help with retaining your cash cows? It doesn't wreck the balance/economy like microtransactions will because everything must be earned legitimately by a player in the first place. It still allows players to pay to \"win\", but you can't win without making your seller win at the same time, so by the end of the day, more people will be happy. Non-RMT players now have a potential way to profit off \"rich idiots\", and are also guaranteed at least in theory that anything money can buy can also be earned in game. You may end up with more people participating in such a system than loot crates, so even if only taking a cut, the company might still generate more revenue in the end. If it works, it's better off for everyone than microtransactions, why wouldn't you prefer it?\n\nWas the early failure of Diablo III to blame? Was it introduced at a wrong time when people were still sensitive to the slightest of Pay2Win? Did the unsuccessful use  (was it really?) in D3 pushed Blizzard and others to seek more direct ways to increase revenue? Why would Blizzard choose MTX over taxed trade in Hearthstone where real money trading for ab testing card game would almost certainly attract zero controversy? Is transaction tax income really minuscule compared to loot crates?",

Two weeks ago I lost pretty much all skill I had in a multiplayer pvp game(Rainbow Six Siege) from one day were it was all fine to next where I would just flat play loke garbage. Since then I am not able to play as before. \nMy Problem is that it is not only in terms of \"mechanical\" skills like aiming I also lost all sense for good decision making. \nEventhough I was never an outstanding Player but there were some rounds that I played really well and carried. As of now there are no such rounds.\nSince yesterday I'm trying to consciously think about every single move that I make and if it makes Sense to do so. I realized a very slow and slight improvement.\n\nWhile doing so I also realized that I experienced this phenomenon once before with an offline strategy game(Xcom) and I did almost the exact same thing to relearn the game you could say.\n\nNow I not only realised that a similar thing happend to me a year or so ago but also that the circumstances were similar.\nBack then I was very self-concious because I felt I was not living up to what I should do or what others expected me to do in school and life in generell.\nRight now I think that I am in a very similar situation because I'm struggeling with many task that I want and have to fulfill at the same time like passing driving test to get my license(yep, I am rather young), learning for my exams(last year of school) and keeping my circle of friends intact eventhough I barely have any time to meet them because they are relativly far away.\n\nSo my theory is that my emotional state affects my gameplay evebthough gaming was always my safe place to clear my head. \n\nHas anyone else ever experienced anything similar to this?\nAnd do you have advice for overcoming this state in which even my normally relaxing activity stresses me?\n\n",

        "text": "Which games are good investments, AKA \"carry over\" to either real life, or to other games? How can you approach gaming so it becomes (more of) an investment?\n\nAnd...what can you can do to make a game/gaming a better investment? (for example, joining a IRL community/meetup group so you gain real life friends, or analyzing the game design)\n\nIf this sounds like an attempt at making gaming productive and you think that's a flawed way of thinking/misses the point, this is not the thread for you.\n\nI completely understand the appeal and the joy in being able to play a game like The Last of Us, finish the game neatly, tie up the story, and then move onto something else without needing anything else from the game. Or even being able to play a few games of Hearthstone during lunch break, just for plain ol’ fun.\n\nThose things are totally fine, but I want to discuss something else.\n\nFrom time to time, something bothers me about gaming. And many gamers quit/reduce playtime because of it. They don't like the feeling that playing a game produces only \"pixels\" and positive emotions within the time spent playing that game. Whether it's an MMO like WoW where all the gear/accomplishments you make at Endgame, or the skills that you develop in a Street Fighter game, these things become useless when your friends move over to a different game.\n\nPeople feel drawn, sometimes because of guilt (of unproductivity), to replacing gaming with activities like reading books or developing IRL skills that can act as investments in their future. For example, if you learn to cook, you can make food for your friends which can not only feel good because of the social rewards (approval, admiration, connecting with other human beings IRL), but also because it helps your REAL LIFE by allowing you to \nfuel your body with high-quality inputs. \n\nAnd I acknowledge that for some people, they should simply game less/stop playing to spend their time building/improving their real life.\n\nBut again, I'm not here to discuss that - let's talk about how we can move on the sliding scale towards building gaming experiences that can COMPLEMENT and ENRICH both our real lives and future gaming experiences.\n\nI've already read Jane McGonigal's “Reality is Broken” book, where she makes a few suggestions on how to get the most IRL benefits out of gaming (along with lots of other stuff about how games make us better - I highly recommend it), which can be summarized as: Lean towards playing with friends - ideally IRL, and no more than 21 hours a week.\n\nThat's a good start, but let's take it further.\n\nWhich games, if you develop skill in them…\n A) lend themselves to improving your real life\n(and/or) \nB) carry over to the future of your gaming experiences?\n\nOn both points A and B, one game that comes to mind for me is Super Smash Brothers Melee. That game has had incredible lasting power (released in 2001), and has a lot of IRL communities built around it for tournaments and even just general fun because it's so popular. As such, putting in serious time into that game does not feel to me like a waste of time because it has allowed me to compete and connect with plenty of people throughout my life. Also, I feel that because I put in the time to learn that game, I will be more familiar with future Smash games (which are likely to be around for a while, and many of us have your fingers crossed for some form of Smash on the Switch). These 2 things add up to make me feel that getting good at Smash was an investment, or at the very least, a BETTER one than \nmany other games. \n\nI don't play them, but I imagine getting good at an FPS like CS:GO or a MOBA like LoL would carry over to future iterations of those genres through developing your aim/\nreflexes/mental representations of how to play, not to mention that those games have large followings that lend themselves to IRL tournaments and clubs. More examples: Guitar Hero\nto learn some basic music skills (I don't play, so I don't know to what extent this is true) or DDR leading to better footwork for IRL dancing. \n\n Any thoughts/recommendations on other games like this? Or how you can approach gaming so it becomes (more of) an investment into your real life/gaming life?\n\nAnd...what can you can do to make a game/gaming a better investment? For example, joining a IRL community/meetup group so you gain real life friends.\n\n(For those of you interested in the backstory behind me pondering this, the reason this question came up for me was because I just read Peak - a book where psychologist Anders Ericsson proposes that anyone can become really good at anything, if you put in enough deliberate practice to develop that skill. I also happened to be thinking a lot about games, so I connected the 2 and wondered “maybe I could get really good at gaming.” But then the question comes up: which game? All of them require different skills.  I could get good at X game, but then it becomes useless the second people move on to a different game.)\n\nTLDR: Which games, if you develop skill in them, lend themselves to improving your real life\n(and/or) carry over to the future of your gaming experiences? What can you do to make gaming (more of) an investment into your real life/gaming life?",

        "text": "What makes permadeath games fun is the fact that each playthrough is different, and even if you die, there is some sort of progression.\n\nThis progression is mostly in the form of upgrades and unlockables:\n\n\n- In Binding of Isaac, you can unlock more levels, characters and items even if you die. This makes your subsequent playthroughs more interesting, and you want to keep playing even if you finish the game.\n\n\n- In Rogue Legacy, you can spend your gold on upgrades that carry on to your future playthroughs. The game gets easier as you invest in these upgrades, and it becomes easier to finish the game. \n\n\n- In risk of rain, you can unlock artifacts to give you interesting powers in your future playthroughs, and you can also unlock new characters to spice things up.\n\n\n- Similarly, in Dead Cells, you can unlock weapons, spells and new level progressions that let you play in different ways. \n\n\n- Don't Starve and Spelunky doesn't let you get stronger by investing in permanent upgrades (other than alternate character unlocks), but the knowledge you gain from playthroughs make you a better player to overcome difficulties with ease. \n\n\nWhat makes these games engaging even if you play them over and over again is their stochasticity. Each time you restart, the levels are generated randomly. This is why you never play the same game twice.\n\nHowever, random level generation often leads to bland level designs. Some game designers mix and match hand crafted levels and random levels and are successful to some extent, but randomly generated content is hardly memorable. \n\nI want to have permadeath and unlockables in a game I might develop someday, and I was wondering if I could get away with using fixed hand crafted levels. Here is an idea:\n\nYou start in a village, and the only path you can take is to the forest. You go to the forest, kill a boss, get a key. You use the key to unlock a dungeon in the village, and you end up dying in the dungeon. \n\nThere is permadeath, so you restart in the village with a brand new character. Since you unlocked the dungeon gate already, it remains unlocked, so you can skip the forest altogether. You might want to grab some essential loot from the forest if you wish, but you can skip it too. You rescue an unlockable character in the dungeon, you flip a switch - a secret passage permanently opens in the forest. \n\nNext time you die, you can start with the alternate character you have rescued, whose starting equipment is better suited for the forest route, so you blaze through it. You kill the optional boss in the forest you were afraid to fight before. You go back to the village, invest in the merchant so he can sell you better items in your next playthrough. Eventually you unlock many routes, and the game becomes very non-linear. Eventually you kill the final boss and win the game. Of course, if you are extremely skilled, you can kill the final boss in your very first playthrough, but the average player has to die many times on different playthroughs.\n\nCan this idea work with non-random levels? Thoughts?\n\n",
