Unfortunately the job was a start up and I was placed into a role I was unqualified for with no guidance. Months later that start up has failed and I feel as though I am no better off as a Developer. I started searching for a new job in January, but the more I look the more hopeless I feel.\n\nI feel like I learned all theory and nothing practical at my college, and now I am stuck with practically no experience, no specialization and an inability to find work that can help provide that. Trying to find sobering willing to train entry level applicants (recent grads) I feel like I am simultaneously drowning and dying of thirst. Every job board shows me hundreds of jobs that are beyond me even when trying to filter them to my experience, yet there seem to be only a handful that I could feasibly join. The few good offers I see end up being scams. \n\nI feel like I have an endless expanse of choices for how to improve myself but no idea on how to do it effectively and in an area that can help. It feels like there is some impossible bridge to cross to get even an inch of progress.\n\nAm I the only one who feels hopeless out of college? Please share your ideas, stories of success or struggles as well. I could use some inspiration or at very least commiseration.",

The relatives I live with don't mind but I'm starting to get antsy and want a salary so that I'm not a burden.

I genuinely enjoy writing elegant code, building cool shit, and solving interesting problems. I love making quality products that are useful or enjoyable for the people who use them.\n\nIt's the social aspect that kills me.  I often see people here say that programming is a social job, and that's very true at my current job. And it's making me miserable. \n\nI just want to work on cool shit.  My work doesn't need some greater meaning for me to find it fulfilling.  I don't care about world events or national politics, which seems to be the inevitable topic for office small talk.  I don't want to hear about my coworkers' personal lives, and I sure as hell don't want to tell them about mine.  I don't want to travel on-site, and I think that work social events are a colossal waste of time.  I believe teams should strive for maximizing productivity with as few meetings as necessary and that emails are an underrated tool.  \n\nThat's not to say I dislike the people I work with, but it's exhausting to pretend like these things are anything less than an annoyance at best and an encroachment of my personal boundaries at worst. Am I SOL?  I think at this point it seems like my choices are:\n\n1. Work for myself\n\n2. Change careers\n\n3. Deal with it \n\nAre there still any jobs out there for those of us antisocial nerds?  Am I just applying to the wrong places? Is the field officially an extrovert's domain?  Should I seriously consider just changing my career entirely? Give it to me straight, folks.  Thanks.",

That's not what it feels like in tech as there have been waves of layoffs starting with larger companies and smaller companies following their lead. \n\nMaybe these question would be better suited in r/economics but asking in case people have insight since I'm more or less asking about this specific to cs-careers. Some of the main questions below (others please feel free to hijack with other questions in comments):\n\n* Are there specific industries/sectors that may continue to lay off workers until the Federal Reserve reverses their interest rate policies? For instance, some retail with normal goods is likely to take a hit with rising prices and consumers moving toward [inferior goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inferior-good.asp#:~:text=An%20inferior%20good%20is%20an,buying%20more%20costly%20substitutes%20instead.). \n\n* Are certain industries safer than others? I imagine those selling inferior goods like used book sellers or something like that will actually do quite well in these times.\n\n* Will startups become riskier due to difficulty (more expensive) in borrowing capital? Is it more likely that can't find funding startups will fail in the next few years? What does this mean for job seekers? Should they avoid these opportunities if they cannot handle the risk?\n\nWhy am I asking these questions? As I and others search for tech jobs, it may be wise to to take answers to the above into account when applying.",

I'm assuming we're going to talk about salary and benefits which I'm also not sure how to approach and negotiate. They're also a startup so equity might be brought up in the discussion. On the job posting they've put a salary range so I'd love to get the upper end of that but it would also be my first tech job and I don't have other offers to leverage. Should I play it safe and ask for a number in that middle salary range? I want to ask for the upper end but I'm afraid they might pick someone else who will take less and I don't want to lose this oppurtunity.

Of course it would be paid :)\n\nWhy I am looking for it: my only HCI prof is of course one of the jurors. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Our customers do not want or need that, they need their specifications fulfilled they do not care if a custom made solution is crafted for them or an exiting cots product is configured. Our clients are unaware of this and of course they do not  budget such massive development, they have a reasonable budget for a custom made product. My issue as a dev is that I cannot create a quality product for our customers, I am always pressed to design everything to be configurable say like SAP or another platform like it. Our boss says it's not acceptable just to make a quality product for our client that is tailored to their needs, it must also be possible to ship that product to the next customer with minimal man-hour s an maximum reusability. In the past this approach has backfired and produces some very badly designed apps that barely satisfied the customer needs. \nMy gut is telling me I should leave the company. What are your views?",

The recruiter was interested in my resume since I had C and C# on there. I don't really have much C# experience aside from a single class I took and the C experience I had was limited to the CS 101/102 intro to programming and data structure classes you take in college but I wasn't about to say that and talk myself out of a job. \n\nI got an interview with the staffing agency's client and it was fairly easy and I wasn't asked hard questions. The hardest questions were the ones I asked since I knew very little about the job. Turns out the job is a 6-month temp job and the client is looking to update an old legacy 911 first responder dispatch system to something new. The backend is entirely C, with the frontend just being some C# winforms. They are hiring a few new grads like myself to work on this project. Ok so a **vital** government legacy C system that will be handled by a bunch of desperate new grads for low pay through a staffing agency...I ask whats the onboarding process like. They want us to be up and running pretty much day 1 as its a tight deadline for the project. Ok... I ask what's the teams structure like, will us new grads have some mentorship or some seniors to get us up to speed, review our code, teach us, etc. They say the amount of mentorship will be extremely minimal and its expected we perform without having our hands held.\n\n\nNow I'm desperate for a job as I haven't gotten jackshit, but am I wrong in thinking there's some pretty big red flags about this job?",

I have actually mostly worked **primarily** on backend. But since the lay off I have been working hard each day on rounding myself out. So since then I have been practicing my js,html,css,react by just building dif components each day. Based on some details the person told me the job will be a lot of refactoring old/badly written code (also jquery to vanilla js) for speed and accessibility. I don't want to try for the job and bomb out, but I don't know how to envision how difficult this work will be. I.E if I can catch on quickly or will be drowning in a sea of things I don't know. Like I have spent time today reading about accessibility and it is seemingly fixing bad HTML/js; but is it like when a teacher teaches u 1 + 1 = 2 and the exam question is 3x +y = 340 solve for x where y is the vibrations of the moon..?\n2. I am also wondering (besides me of course needing money) how a random part time job spent doing refactoring looks on a resume, like if I add this to my resume will an employer think of it as valuable? So like is it worth it.\n\nIdk maybe i'm overreacting its not like I have 100% gotten the job yet so maybe I should just go with the flow and see what happens..",

I interviewed for two internships so far, one was a month ago and the other was two weeks ago and I haven't heard back from either one. I’m not sure what to do and it’s getting late. We're in march, and the internships start in may. \n\nI’m proficient in python, C/C++, java and I have pretty good experience in Linux. I worked as a customer success manager at a tech startup for a few months before I start my degree, so I have some experience in the industry.

I prefer remote work due to productivity, sense of progress, and work-life balance. I fear discussing my concerns with my manager, as it may seem uncooperative. Any ideas on how to handle this?\n\n**Full Post**\n--\nHey, I'm a UK-based software engineer who started my career as a Junior dev ~2 years ago, fully remote due to the pandemic. After around 8 months, my company reopened offices and some people started hybrid work.\n\nDespite being only an hour away, I chose to continue working remotely and have been doing so the last 2 years. However, in the past six months, I've faced social pressure to come into the office, while some team members working from other cities don't. \n\nAlthough the role is still advertised as remote, hybrid, or office-based, the social pressure makes me feel like I'm not being a team player. Recently, a team member asked me in a daily standup if I plan to come into the office since I \"have no excuse,\" which made me uncomfortable. It was unexpected and I felt like I had to address the elephant in the room when I said remote working just appeals.\n\nI've been really anxious about the pressure to come into the office lately, even though I prefer working remotely due to productivity, sense of progress, and work-life balance. I don't feel like there's anything missing, so I don't want to disrupt that.\n\nBut I haven't discussed my concerns with my manager as I fear it may seem like I'm just uncooperative. It's easy to suggest that I come in at least once every two weeks, given my proximity to the office. To anyone else that's still very chill, but I know that I would just be dreading those days and it will affect how happy I am as a person.\n\nIt feels wrong that the role can technically be \"remote\", but just because I'm close to the office I can be forced to come in through anxiety inducing social pressure. Any idea on how to handle this?",

Also, my knowledge in ML is getting a bit rusty, so please suggest some courses I can take up to get better at it and also to learn advanced ML. Thanks in advance!",
