We are students researching about the popularity and preference of select programming languages.  The five (5) selected programming languages are C/C++, C#, Java, Python and Ruby.\n\nThe survey will only take 1-2 minutes (It's short :D)\n\nIf you have exposure to at least one of these programming languages, please consider leaving a response.\n\nMore details are in the survey.\n[Survey Link](https://goo.gl/forms/pDVWdN6MrUA0W0Rg1)\n\nThank you to anyone who would spare their time!\n\nEdit: Do note that answering this survey requires you to sign-in to a Google account.

At this rate I'm thinking I might just do a review of the literature, but I'd like to do something more narrow and involved. \n\nI have some questions:\n\n**1.** How would one begin to analyse social media data (Twitter, Facebook etc)? People do this and I haven't the foggiest how they actually get started. I assume they have to write an algorithm that will take as input Twitter or Facebook data (Tweets) and then analyse each Tweet by matching keywords and then output a Boolean result based on answering a given research question (e.g., \"Does at least half of this data set contain the words \"flu\" and \"vaccine\")? \n\n**2.** How would one actually go about getting large volumes of Tweets that could be fed into an algorithm? \n\n**3.** In general, any ideas for some interesting research questions on this topic, or something closely related. \n\nThe only research question I have come up with based on the limited amount of reading I have done is: To what extent can AI help accurately predict disease outbreaks by studying social media data? \n\nPlease also note that my technical knowledge of CS is not great, I'm not good at programming (scraping passing grades) so I can't build or design anything, not in any great detail (I don't have to neither according to my department). \n\nSorry if this is not the right place to post such a question, but thanks for reading anyway.

I need this for a project at high school, so I’d avoid extremely precise and technical stuff. My objective is to convey some basic information about this topic, just to present all these possible technologies.\nFor instance, I’ve heard something about DNA computing and storage, which will probably come before quantum computing (this is what Michio Kaku thinks, if I got it correctly).\nI don’t need lots of physical demonstrations that would interrupt the fluency of this task.\n\nTell me if my explanation was clear (it’s a bit difficult to explain as this type of exam only exists here, where I live, it’s not like American presentations) and ofc thank you in advance!",

In k iterations the standard Bellman Ford algorithm can produce shortest path using more than k edges.\n\nHere is a fairly naive idea that uses k-iterations of the standard algorithm:\n\n- In the i-th iteration only nodes that are not more than i edges away from the starting node, will be considered. Eg: In the first iteration only the nodes that are adjacent to the starting node, in the second iteration the nodes above plus the nodes that are adjacent to the prior. \n- Edge relaxation is only allowed when the resulting path does not use more edges. \n\nThis should be easy to implement. Do you think this will work, or are there any flaws that I have overseen?",

        "text": "This is a rather clumsy question, but I'm trying to work something out. This post is motivated by I conversation I had with an ecologist trying to working with events in systems which occur in a sequence, i.e. the events are related by time.\n\nI suspect this is a machine learning/deep learning task...though perhaps there's something in computer vision.\n\nLet me give two abstract examples, \"thought experiments\":\n\n(1) Let's say you didn't know how to play chess. However, I am able to give you thousands of images of chess boards in mid-play; that is, for several years, I've been politely interrupting thousands of games of chess and taking pictures of a chess board from time start to time finish. I give them to you, but they are not labeled as to when during the game I took the picture.\n\nQuestion: could you infer (or statistically characterize) the rules of chess? That is, how could you characterize with confidence how the pieces move, the sequence of how the pieces are played, etc.?\nWhat methods could one use to at least describe the rules of the game?\n\n(2) Let's say there's a 1000 by 1000 matrix of pixel values, all black.\nBased on a color order rule that I know but you don't know, I switch a small subset of the pixels to either blue, red, green, yellow or purple. Once a pixel is switched from black to a non-black color, it cannot be switched again. (As an example, the rule is turn a few black pixels to red, then a few black pixels to green, then blue, then purple, then yellow. The rule is red-green-blue-purple-yellow.)\nI do this hundreds of thousands of times, each time starting with a new set of all black pixels, and saving the matrix at some point before I'm done.\nI send you each of these matrices.\n\nFrom these thousands of matrices, how could you possibly infer the sequence of colors? Could you also infer something about where I've decided to place the colored pixels (i.e. is it entirely random or could there be a logic to where I'm placing these pixels)?",

But the Wikipedia entry for [Regular grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_grammar#Examples) gives an example of a right regular grammar equivalent to the regular expression `a*bc*`. Because the Kleene star represents an unbounded number of occurrences (O or more), it would seem that the regular expression describes a language that is not finite. What does finite mean in the context of regular languages?",
