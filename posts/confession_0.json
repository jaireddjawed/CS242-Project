He was a few years older but he looked out for me and I got along with sister as well. I only remember key moments, I don’t know how it all started. I don’t even remember if I fought back. I just remember he would pull his pants down and tell me to blow him. This is the very first time I speak of it because I didn’t really think it affected. I believe it did have some negative effects such as addiction to certain taboos and me being more into oral. I was exposed to explicit contents at a much younger age and it affected my hormones. I don’t remember much but it starting to feel as if I’m starting to remember more and realize it might have happen more times than I can remember. Is this normal?",

She wouldn’t tell me if she was dating or talking or anything and my severe anxiety kicked in and started to panic.. long story short I went through her phone. Text messages with this 1 guy in specific (im very mature for a 10 yr old so I knew a lot of things about s3x / nud3s etc) and uhm they were sending Amazon things of s3x toys and he sent a image of a person “squirting”  (iykyk) and she said “I love what u do in b3d.\n\n\n\nNow im not disgusted or disappointed I shouldn’t of even went through her phone.

I finished my morning checks and told my boss I have to go home. I was showered and in bed by 10am with the chills, many trips to the bathroom where my poops turned to a brutal 7 until the big one at 1:30pm.\n\nMy chills turned into sweats, I went from sitting on the toilet to sitting on the edge of my tub. Loud and violent I vomited repeatedly, after the third heave I began to leak into my shorts after the sixth or seventh it began pouring onto the floor. The stench was putrid, my vomit matched the waterfall turned babbling brook of shit. My wife knocked on the door asking if she was ok and I yelled back “DO NOT COME IN HERE”. \n\nAfter I thought I was done exercising my demons I asked her to get my some disinfectant wipes, a garbage bag and paper towels. “Please leave them outside the door” I desperately said. When I heard her walk away I cracked the door grabbing the supplies and got to work cleaning up the scene of the crime. Everything that touched poop went into the bag including my shorts, bath mat, hand towel half a roll of disinfectant wipes, paper towels etc. I tied the bag up air tight and turned on the shower where i repeatedly fired number 7s of hot lava out of my ass down they shower drain.\n\nAfter 20 minutes I knew I was in the clear and done cleaning up crime scene number two I shut the shower down, dropped my head in shame and told my wife about the animal she married. I am a 41 year old man that shit his pants on pi day.",

THIS IS A REPOST.\n\nto clarify, nobody knows it’s mine, but it’s extremely internally embarrassing when someone mentions that it’s there and nobody has claimed it. i suspect my teacher knows it’s mine because it clearly looks like my teeth, but i’ll never know. I’ve tried grabbing it but someone was always watching me. \n\nA few people have said “That’s so disgusting.” when they saw it (my teacher literally put it under the white board and drew an arrow that said “someone’s invisalign”) which makes it even more embarrassing to say it’s mine. A few other people have invisalign in that class so i don’t know how easily they can identify me. \n\nIt’s not just that class either. I lost my case to them so whenever i get a new invisalign i just keep it in my pocket. problem is, i tend to keep a lot of things in my pockets all at once and the invisalign probably slips out when i’m grabbing something. I lost my old invisalign in my 6th period and my teacher the next day said “Um, someone’s invisalign is on the floor.” I tried to make it clear that it wasn’t mine by flashing the one i had in my mouth, and also saying “i don’t sit back there so it’s not mine.” but she knows I have an invisalign because I ask her if i can clean them sometimes. \n\n\ntwo classes i’ve made the same mistake and the evidence is clear. I never lose my invisalign but i’ve lost two in two weeks. i’m so embarrassed to admit they’re mine. I’m sure the janitor will throw it out eventually.",

        "text": "I’ve probably stolen over $5000 worth of merchandise, mostly clothing and jewelry. Honestly, it was easy, and I never got caught or questioned. You’re the only ones who know now. \n\nThe first time I did it, I’d take jewelry here and there. Normally I’d hide the packaging in the trash when I took it out to the dumpster. The jewelry would go on my body or deep in a purse pocket. Always cleared bag checks! \n\nI moved on to stealing shirts and leggings when I found I could easily layer things (for example, leggings under my jeans). Sometimes when I purchased items, I’d hide a few things at the bottom of the bag that I didn’t buy. It helped that one girl I worked with was about my size, and we found out she stole things after she quit. Because of her even after inventory, I was in the clear for yet another year. \n\nI took these techniques with me after retail. My last job (not retail) required a lot of daily driving. I usually had to find a mall to stretch my legs on my lunch break. I stole a good amount of jeans, dress pants, leggings, and tops at various department stores all on my lunch. All I had to do was find clothes that didn’t have censors, layer up (my record is 4 pairs of pants under my work pants). I ripped off tags and stashed them in the fitting rooms or inside my socks. Sometimes I’d purchase a couple things just in case the tags had hidden censors. Then, I could return the purchased items to another location. \n\nI miss it. I still get excited seeing my full dresser drawers and closet. I still wouldn’t be able to afford buying any of it.",
