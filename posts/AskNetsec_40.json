        "text": "Hello everyone! I have been working in IT for a few years and have maintained various certifications including A+, Net+, Sec+, CCNA, MCSA Server 2012R2, and recently C|EH. Lately I have been primarily working as an instructor and not too much in the field. I would say I am very good on theory (regarding my certs, not programming) but weak on coding. I aim to learn more about **penetration testing** and that is the extent I want to get out of learning coding, as far as my immediate goals, if that makes sense!  \n\nI feel confident with security best practices (defense) and Active Directory, but I really want to go beyond being a script kiddie.  \n\nAny guidance would be appreciated. Also if there are any sources recommended for learning, I'll gladly listen. I have been running through Sololearn(dot)com the past couple days going through HTML, Javascript, and PHP. I have a couple of pdf books for *Python*, which is what I plan to primarily focus on. I plan to learn some Ruby in the future, when I get more comfortable with coding in other languages. So far the lessons are easy to understand and digest; I was able to get a lot done between 3 languages in 2 days. However, I'm now wondering where to go from here, as I learned only the bare-bones basics. I have been working on Python now, happy that I'll be able to understand my Firebug outputs just a *little* better now, but still got some work to do for sure. \n\nI have struggled in the past with the logic of coding :/ and failed to remain consistent. I have never taken any formal classes and am self taught in my other areas. I need to give myself practice every day and motivation. I plan on getting it done now that I have a little free time in the mornings.  \n\nMy goal this year is to feel confident in purchasing the **OSCP** course and passing the exam. I have read a couple reviews from people who passed that *claimed they had little to no coding experience* prior to the class. I would rather be prepared and knowledgeable as possible. I am somewhat familiar with msfconsole (you don't actually learn it for C|EH surprisingly) and I know it's a matter of knowing what modules to load and setting up remote exploits (at least from the exercises I've done in my own lab) but it seems having a knowledge of programming is required for getting the most out of it.  \n\nThat being said, I do have a virtual lab using VirtualBox with resources like Metasploitable, DVWA, Vulnerable Windows boxes, Kali, and a couple other things. I am still learning to make the most of my environment. Things I need to work on include SQL injections. I am weak on Database coding bigtime. I have used msfconsole to run various vulnerabilities I have researched, and I have also used the web interface on Windows to exploit an outdated java browser extension. I feel comfortable with nmap and various tools for password cracking, persistent backdoors, etc. My C|EH studies have my familiar with this but no programming. I can pick out versions from banner grabbing and certain slivers from code outputs but if I try to explain it to myself out loud, I find I don't understand a good deal of what I see more often than I'd like to admit.  \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!

        "text": "Sorry for the lengthy post\n\nSome background:\nI have become the designated IT guy at my company along with my current job of being a web dev. The reason I got this designation is because we are moving to a new location and I'm the only one with some enterprise networking experience. Our company is a small-medium sized business with around 30 employees currently with plans to grow much more this year. We are a web based marketing company that sells custom wheels and tires through our website. \n\nSo background on our network that I set up. I went with a Ubiquiti Unifi setup, which should be plenty for us for a while with plenty of room to expand, and got the cloud key for convenience since I won't regularly be on site for the beginning of this year. Have VLANs setup for a management LAN, our main LAN, and a guest/client LAN. Right now I have the firewall set up to drop all ports coming into the WAN except for the ports we need for the cloud key, http/s, and ssh, and keeping documentation on what ports are open and will be opening in the future. The firewall is also setup so that the VLANs can't talk/see each other. \n\nRight now we don't have any servers on site (our website is done on an AWS server) but I have plans on presenting the benefits of having a simple storage server on site. Most of our financials and other sensitive HR stuff is done online with Dropbox (not sure how I feel about that) or just on paper. We also don't have any standard for on site devices. Everyone pretty much uses what could be considered their own personal device (company pays for it, but they get their choice on what they want, or they just bring their own device).\n\nNow this is the best that I know to keep our network as secure as possible, but I still feel like this is not enough. My recommendation to my boss would be to have a professional consultation.\n\nAfter talking to my lead about this, I was told my boss \"won't want to spend any money on this after initial setup\" and \"wants this setup like his network at home.\" And my lead isn't on the same page as me saying stuff like \"we don't have servers so it shouldn't be an issue.\" Even though I explained some of the things that can happen if there is an intrusion. \n\nKind of at a brick wall with explaining how important network security is for a small business. If there's any tips you guys have on explaining how important this is, or anything I can do currently to help secure our network more, would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "Hi AskNetsec, first off, I hope this is close enough to the right subreddit. I realize that this question seems like a very I-am-very-new-to-programming-question at face value. Please keep reading.\n\nI'm a graduated CS student and I believe myself to be a fairly competent programmer. I have a good job lined up and I've had internships, etc. I currently work doing front-end web development. This is just for context. I know my fair share of programming languages, I am probably most fluent in javascript and python. However, due to my progression through higher education, I was never introduced to C or C++. \n\nI feel like this is a hole in my knowledge. I have a cursory knowledge of C/C++ and am familiar with computer architecture, assembly but would describe myself as pretty seriously a noob when it comes down to writing a C program. I am not neccessarily interested in pivoting my career into infosec or netsec but it is what got me interested in programming/CS. I have some time before I start my job and I've been spending it enriching myself, filling holes in my education. \n\nSo my question is this: given my background, in a security/netsec context, which will be more \"enriching\"? It seems everything I search on is either 1) very detailed, to the point regarding implementation or 2) geared towards people just getting started\n\nI'm tempted to say that C will provide a better learning experience but C++ generally seems easier to learn. Is this true? Which will provide more value? C++ seems easier and more familiar.\n\nSorry if this isn't necessarily a question for this subreddit. I am tempted to ask it on /r/cscareeradvice but it's not really a career question and I've found that the folks here tend to be more experience and humble. ",

So the question is : is it worth using last version firefox to get updated security add-ons even though the last version firefox might have a security weakness.

        "text": "I have a very strange problem. My exploit only works inside the debugger AND only when I set a breakpoint. Why?\n\n\nI know it's hard to tell without much code or details but maybe you've faced something similar and any hint would help me at this point.\n\n\nHere is what I'm doing:\n\n\n1. redirect EIP to a space I control where I put a stager:\n2. I call malloc to allocate new buffer in heap\n3. I save the allocated buffer address in a register (EBX)\n3. I call socket.recv() to use that buffer and receive new shellcode\n4. I jmp to the buffer (EBX)\n\n\n\nExploit as described works whenever I set a breakpoint in the debugger, but fails when I don't or I run the binary outside of the debugger. (Same behaviour is observed whether the process is opened or attached to the debugger)\n\n\nThe binary is a windows network service\n\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\n\n\nedit1 : someone suggested to use hardware breakpoint instead. I did and the same thing happened.\nI've never seen something like this before so I'm summing up all the dark souls of infosec to solve this\n\n\n\nEdit2: Almost there ... after hours of trying to figure the problem out; it seems that the call instruction is the problem. call to an address seems to change depending on the position in the stack. How can we solve this?\n\n\n\n**Edit3: THE BREAK THROUGH (NOT)**It is indeed the call instruction causing this issue. Because it seems the call instruciton is dependant on the position see screenshot:  https://i.stack.imgur.com/uBaPb.png\n\nSo what ends up happening is that if I exploit the program without breakpoints the recv call gets an address that doesn't point to recv() and the shellcode is not copied into the buffer hence we end up in 0000000000 land.\n\nnow the real question is HOW do you have a constant call instruction independent of its position?\n\n\nEdit4: answering my last edit; you can do that with absolute calls as documented [here](https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_26.html); this solves the problem of call but the shellcode is till not ending in the heap if I don't have a breakpoint. \n\n\nedit5: thanks to /r/liveOverflow, he mentioned maybe the recv() is non blocking and hence I'm not waiting for the shell enough, hence I made some changes to my exploit so it only jmps to the shellcode if actually recv() return a size &gt; 1 and not -1 (error code). This however did not solve my issue, but we're closer!!! - the shellcode is only ending in memory on breakpoint. There is one thing about my exploit that I have doubts about is that I hardcode the socket descriptor into the recv() call, is that ok? (it works on breakpoint). I got this descriptor by looking at the stack while recv() was being called somewhere else in the program.\n\n\nEdit6: AMAZINGLY - the descriptor is not the problem, hardocidng it seems to be fine just like getting it from the stack (as a variable). I also tried to insert a INT3 (\\xcc) into the stager, and AMAZINGLY the exploit does not work the first break, but after I continue from that break point (since it's a loop now) ... the exploit works ...... I feel defeated. I Don't know what else to try anymore?\nwhat is this magic behind the break point???????????????\nit's killing me \n\n\n**Edit 7: LAST EDIT** I finally solved this maze. It was the fact that I had \\r\\n added to my stagger shellcode ...  which was ending the data stream prematurely, and still catching it when I had a breakpoint on..... KILL ME.\n\n\n\n",

What kind of information can be pulled from the mobile phone network? For example, can the past browsing histories of my PHONE be pulled and reviewed? or what kind of apps I have downloaded on my phone. Can my email accounts of my phone be tracked even though I am only using the mobile hotspot to connect my work computer to the internet?\n\nSimilar scenario, but this time using my personal home network to connect my work computer at home. Could my employer later take my laptop or if they have a tracking software installed on the work laptop, could they track the traffic, network history, browing history etc of things going on in the personal home network?\n\nThank you, in advance, for the answers.",

Since my server is hosting a number of cloud services, I thought maybe it was one of them, and I started looking for them... \n\nNope, they're all what they're supposed to be. \n\nSo I stared looking into folder sizes to find the culprit, one by one, until I saw Program Files\\OpenSSH (which I use for SFTP) is about 300 GB big. WTF? Navigate a little further, the sshd.log file is the culprit. I can't open a 300GB text file with text editor, and I can't install new programs since there's 0 bytes left in the drive since last time I erased anything (made some space by cleaning up the recycling bin and what not) it went back to 0 bytes, so I figured this error would refill *sshd.log* and I'd be able to see it then. \n\nThen my jaw dropped:\n&gt; 8280 17:50:47 535 error: chdir(\"/\"): Permission denied\n&gt; \n&gt; 8280 17:50:47 535 Server listening on :: port 22.\n&gt; \n&gt; 8280 17:50:47 536 Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.\n&gt; \n&gt; 8280 17:50:47 536 error: Couldn't create pid file \"./sshd.pid\": Permission denied\n&gt; \n&gt; 13088 17:50:49 197 error: chdir(\"/\"): Permission denied\n&gt; \n&gt; 13088 17:50:49 197 error: Couldn't create pid file \"./sshd.pid\": Permission \n&gt; denied\n&gt; \n&gt; 13088 17:50:50 719 error: DsGetDcNameW() failed with error: 1355 \\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 13088 17:50:50 719 Invalid user root from 222.186.43.6 port 63984\n&gt; \n&gt; 13088 17:50:50 719 Failed none for invalid user root from 222.186.43.6 port 63984 ssh2\n&gt; \n&gt; 13088 17:50:51 035 Failed password for invalid user root from 222.186.43.6 port 63984 ssh2\n&gt; \n&gt; 13088 17:50:51 297 Failed password for invalid user root from 222.186.43.6 port 63984 ssh2\n&gt; \n&gt; 13088 17:50:51 565 Failed password for invalid user root from 222.186.43.6 port 63984 ssh2\n&gt; \n&gt; 13088 17:50:51 858 Received disconnect from 222.186.43.6 port 63984:11: \n&gt; \n&gt; 13088 17:50:51 858 Disconnected from invalid user root 222.186.43.6 port 63984\n&gt; \n&gt; 7068 17:51:15 864 error: chdir(\"/\"): Permission denied\n&gt; \n&gt; 7068 17:51:15 865 error: Couldn't create pid file \"./sshd.pid\": Permission denied\n&gt; \n&gt; 6028 17:51:23 142 error: chdir(\"/\"): Permission denied\n&gt; \n&gt; 6028 17:51:23 142 error: Couldn't create pid file \"./sshd.pid\": Permission denied\n&gt; \n&gt; 6028 17:51:24 519 error: DsGetDcNameW() failed with error: 1355 \\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 6028 17:51:24 519 Invalid user root from 222.186.43.6 port 39093\n&gt; \n&gt; 6028 17:51:24 519 Failed none for invalid user root from 222.186.43.6 port 39093 ssh2\n&gt; \n&gt; 6028 17:51:24 760 Failed password for invalid user root from 222.186.43.6 port 39093 ssh2\n&gt; \n&gt; 6028 17:51:25 024 Failed password for invalid user root from 222.186.43.6 port 39093 ssh2\n&gt; \n&gt; 6028 17:51:25 300 Failed password for invalid user root from 222.186.43.6 port 39093 ssh2\n&gt; \n&gt; 6028 17:51:25 567 Received disconnect from 222.186.43.6 port 39093:11: \n&gt; \n&gt; 6028 17:51:25 567 Disconnected from invalid user root 222.186.43.6 port 39093\n&gt; \n&gt; 7068 17:51:42 562 WARNING: could not open ./moduli (No such file or directory), using fixed modulus\n&gt; \n\nWhen I checked the IP address with *whois* it tells me it's from China, and obviously someone's trying to get in through my SSH service, by just guessing the password, and install his own *sshd.pid*, which I bet has executable access and its own log-on rules. \n\nSince it was the same address repeated a bunch of times, I just blocked it, which worked for a while, but now I'm getting different addresses. \n\nAfter that I posted all of the above in r/HomeNetworking, and taking up on one suggestion I switched sshd to allow only connections from known users, but now I can't logon at all in any of my devices.
