        "text": "Hello. I am not a linguist and have no formal education in that field. However, I am fascinated by language as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nOne topic that has been constantly on my mind is the comparison between the acquisition of a native language/s and foreign ones.\n\nI wonder, what do studies conclude about this?\n\nAs an example, native speakers are usually considered to be of much higher proficiency than those who learned it as a foreign tongue. However, does that mean that one's native language holds a special place in the human brain? Is it, \"prioritised\" as the, \"default\" way of communication, or is, \"stored\" the same way as other languages?\n\nHave non-natives been found to be able to match the level of natives?\n\nAs an example, we can see plenty of cases of adults who spend decades in another country, surrounded by a foreign language, yet they retain a strong accent. Children need significantly less time to acquire a native accent in their first language.\n\nSo I wonder, is it proven that native speakers are inherently, \"superior\", to non-natives? Does the native language hold a special place in the brain? Is it treated as the, \"default\" by the brain?\n\nAlso, there are people with more than one native language, which is for instance common amongst Indians. How come they can speak two languages with no (foreign) accent, but an adult struggles to do the same thing?\n\nAlso, would it mayhaps be possible to acquire a native-level understanding of a closely related language? I am Polish. Would it be fairly easy for me to acquire a native-like understanding of Czech, as it is a closely related language with similar phonetics (as opposed to English or German)? Or does that bear no relation? If I already speak Polish, why shouldn't I be able to reach a level of fluency identical to that of a native in a closely related language?",

I thought I‚Äôd share this example that simply blew my mind, maybe some of you are interested to try this as well.\n\nI had a longer conversation which Chat GPT and then asked if I made any mistakes,  if he was able to detect I am not a native speaker and guess my native language. Even though I made no mistakes, he could tell English is not my first language and even correctly identify German a my native language. Apparently, there are differences in sentence structure and how commonly a specific structure is used. So the way I phrased things was not grammatically wrong but just uncommon. I thought this is fascinating because it is something I otherwise might have never picked up or been told in human conversation. \nBelow is an example of different sentence structure from my conversation with GPT:\n\n\n‚ÄûPlease provide an example of stentence structure commonly used in Germany but less common in English native writing from my conversation‚Äú\n\n‚ÄûHere is an example of sentence structure that is more commonly found in German-language writing but less common in native English writing:\n\n\"Can you list mistakes or examples of poor wording in my conversation with you?\"\n\nIn this sentence, the word order of \"mistakes or examples of poor wording\" is more typical of German sentence structure, where the noun phrase is placed before the verb. In native English writing, it is more common to place the verb before the noun phrase, as in \"Can you list examples of poor wording or mistakes in my conversation with you?\"\n\nThis is just one example, and it is important to note that there is a lot of variation in both English and German, and not all sentences in German-language writing will have this particular structure.‚Äú\n\n\nThis is amazing and I think it‚Äôs a great tool to fine-tune your skills and recognize patterns in your writing. \nFunny side note: I struggled to come up with a title for this post so I let GPT do the work lol",

I think people that has spanish as their first language are one of the luckiest, because they speak one of the most spoken languages in the world but not **the** most spoken, or most used, which is english, so they still need to learn another language, with all the benefits that comes with it: learning another language, improved memory, creative thinking etc. Plus, it's easier for them to learn a whole lot of languages: portuguese, french, italian, romanian etc.\n\nMaybe you think people that speak chinese are the luckiest because it's also one of the most spoken? or arabic? Or it all depends on your goals (someone might think speaking german is useful because some of the wealthiest countries in Europe speak german)? Let me know! Thank you for reading my post, would like to know your opinion.",

        "text": " Hi Language learners,\n\nwe have created the app **Flipchat**, and we honestly believe it is becoming the best free to use mobile app for learning a language to conversational level (weird flex, right?). Flipchat is a chat app where you learn a language by chatting with your friends.\n\n**Why?**\n\nMost people use other mobile language apps for a brief amount of time simply because learning a language is not fun enough. What do people enjoy doing on their phone? Most of the time, they are communicating with friends. That's why we at Flipchat created an app where you can learn while communicating with your friends.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nFlipchat is a chat application where you chat with your friends in your native language, but everything is displayed in the language you want to learn. For example, if my native language is English and I want to learn Spanish, I can type in English and everything will be displayed in Spanish. If you don't understand something, you can always get the English version or the audio. If your friend's native language is Dutch and he or she wants to learn German, that's possible in the same chat. You don't need to find friends who want to learn the same language, you can learn any language with any friend.\n\n**Advantages of Flipchat:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. You are learning a language by doing what you're doing anyways.\n2. You are only using words that you are going to use, and you've probably already used them.\n3. You have context to figure out what the other person means, no more isolated sentences.\n4. You can learn any language with any friend.\n5. Flipchat is a chat app that knows how you use the language, and in the future, we want to create custom-made language lessons.\n\n**Other features:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* You can try typing in the language you want to learn and check for accuracy, this way you can compete with your friends.\n* If you're new to a language, instead of seeing everything in the foreign language, only the most used words will be translated (we call this the Lite mode).\n* Streak features to increase activity.\n\n**Things we are working on:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Creating a speech-to-text feature.\n* Improving the Lite mode.\n* Connecting it with other messaging apps (still quite expensive).\n* Custom-made language lessons based on how you use the language you're learning.\n\nThere is still a lot to do, but we at Flipchat are very excited. Let us know what you think, or even better, download the app for yourself :)",

        "text": "Hi, first time posting here!\n\nFor context, my partner and I both speak 5 languages either natively or with high fluency. Not only that, but we really only have two of those languages in common (English and French, we also live in a Francophone area), which are not our mother tongues. If we were to have a family, there is potentially up to 8 languages of exposure that we could potentially give to our kids. Furthermore, they are from several different linguistic families (3 Latin based, 3 \"Germanic\" ones (counting English here), one Slavic and one Turkik). \n\nNow, I consider that number to be quite absurd, I don't think that any couple with a normal work life can allocate the time for a reasonable exposure to each of those. Not to speak about the confusion that this can cause in a child.\n\nHow many is too many? In terms of what is reasonable to expect from a kid.  I know that I myself speak several, but I was raised in 2 and the others I learnt, same for my partner (with a different subset). Where is the balance between taking advantage of when a kid can learn more swiftly/easily and overburdening them?\n\nPS: I did some research and saw that similar questions have been answered before, but they are often about people wanting to teach languages that they themselves are not fluent at or with a much lower volume of them. In any case, if this question is redundant, happy to know!",

        "text": "Hi! I've been studying Japanese independently  for about 1 year now, and last year on December 4th I did the exam at RJ - Brazil, where I live. I wasn't actually finished with this level, but I was already doing the Spanish Siele and English IELTs tests for putting in my extracurriculars at college, so I decided to do the JPLT too just to see how it was. \n\nTbh when I entered the room I was really surprised because I thought I'd be one of the oldest there, since Japanese is such a \"trendy\" language on the internet, so I imagined a room full of teens, but I was probably the youngest there, lmao.\n\n The people were also pretty diverse in the way that it wasn't just Japanese descendents, but also normal people you see anywhere. Literally every single person also looked (and probably is) a nerd, and for some reason 90% wore glasses (including me) ,lol. I thought the nerd stereotype was just a stereotype until that day XD. It also had a considerable amount of people, considering how hard the language is, but it's done in just this one center in the whole RJ state, so idk.\n\nThe exam was also fully of objective answers in paper, with reading and listening parts, unlike the exam of other languages that also had speaking and writing parts, but I think that was hilarious because it perfectly fits the Japanese culture. It's like the exam reflects the country's/language's personality.\n\nThe exam also had questions that seemed more like N2 or N4. Some kanjis like Ë™≠„ÇÄ(read) or Ë©±„Åô(speak) that are literally N5 had hiraganas above them, when other ones that were harder didn't, and these two literally had questions asking to identify them, and at the same page they were asking to identify kanjis about medical terms like \nÂ§±Ë°Ä (blod loss).üíÄ \n\nWell, overall it was a good experience imo, but I was a little disappointed about the questions. I expected more from such an organised and educated country like Japan, and I feel bad for the friends I made there because unlike me doing just for fun, some people were doing to get scholarships at local colleges. I still love the language and on December of 2023, I plan on taking a higher level XD. \n\nThanks for anyone who read until the end, here's a cookie for you üç™üíï",

I dread the 30 minute lessons and have found my mind wandering more and more making my retention pretty bad. I've decided to stop or at least pause my Pimsleur learning for the moment.\n\nThe problem is I don't really know where to go from here. I'm past the beginner stage where starting another beginner program from scratch would probably be boring and not super beneficial. But I don't know enough to understand fluent podcasts. I tried listening to the Duolingo podcast and kept getting lost and frustrated, though when I read the transcript I could get 70-80% of it.\n\nWould it be a good use of my time to listen to something like the Duolingo podcast, even if i'm only picking up on every other word?\n\nAny other recommendations on how to proceed?\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I saw some videos few days ago about Latin and the benefits of learning it and how there are resources to do so etc. and I wanted to learn it, moreover because I am very fond of etymology and history of languages in general so I always wanted to learn either greek or Latin, but I never really took the plunge, until those new elements motivated me again.\nBut now I am learning Spanish since june and while I'm quite conformable with the language, I am clearly not fluent and I still have a lot to learn, I would say that maybe I am halfway through my learning.\nSo I wanted to know if it was better to continue with spanish until I more or less master it, then I fully dedicate my time to Latin, or do I start Latin now considering it's the root of Spanish (and also french, my native language, for that matter) so maybe it will eventually help me learn spanish more efficiently, knowing that I won't completely abandon spanish, I will continue to receive input from time to time.",

        "text": "I recently had a trip to Korea and Japan, because i heard its so easy to learn Korean (Hangul) i decided to watch a 10 minute youtube video the day before my flight. It was indeed as easy as they say, spend 2 more hours researching and i managed to read things in Korea and it was quite useful. \n\nWhen i got back i just got a feeling i wanted to learn Korean. Partly due to me wanting to learn a new language and also because i feel that since Hangul is that easy to understand i dont have to worry about reading and writing, compared to for example Chinese characters. I do have korean friends so i can practice a bit and watch a korean move/drama once a month which would be nice if i dont have to read subtitles. \n\nHowever other than that i dont have a good reason like wanting to move there or have a partner who is korean etc. So im a bit worried that it wont stick if i do decide to commit to learning it. Im also not good with languages which worries me a bit as well. For the people who have more experience with learning new languages, will the new language stick with you if you have no real good reason to learn the new language?",
