        "text": "TL:DR- Warhammer is really good. It has an epic and heroic vocabulary, and powerful imagery. It's a story of familial civil war where people that thought strife was impossible come to terms that they were betrayed. We see people double-crossed, who double-cross their condemned brethren to stay alive. We see a team that bands together to fight the rebels with absolute trust and confidence and another team that would inhume each of the rebels we're the primary objective. There are stories of love and sacrifice, deception and decent into madness. Brotherly bonds and devotion to duty that inspire hope. Everything below the line is me fanboying\n\n\\-----\n\nI've seen memes for years. Facebook, or when /r/Grimdark hits r/all; my son downloaded a free game where he's running around with a sword with chainsaw teeth on it. Without being entirely precise I know that in the year 40,000 the Emperor of Mankind is some ghoul on a Golden Throne receiving the human sacrifice of 1,000 psychic humans, called Psykers, there are Legions of Trans/Post Humans called Astartes/Space Marines that have been augmented war, and a princeling named Horus rebelled against the emperor; half the Emperor's sons joined him.  Then I learned the 60+book series  of multiple Authors that was ending very soon. I was disappointed by GRRM abandoning his abandoning GOT for prequels and Robert Jordan dying, so I've been loathe to start series that aren't finished. I prefer to read classics.  But hearing that it was ending I decided to start  to see if its worth racing to finish all books by the time the final book is out. The penultimate book comes out in a few days, the final is TBA. \n\nI'm 8 books in. Its good. Its really good. I told someone that I was reading Warhammer and they scoffed because they thought it was just space marines being awesome- all the time. But its more than that. Its a story of Civil War and brothers-in-arms that thought the idea of space marine on space marine strife was incomprehensible. In this Story, the Emperor of Mankind is nigh immortal and incredibly powerful. He clones himself into 20 children called 'Primarchs', each one is a aspect of his personality, comically magnified and named.  Mortarion is scythe bearing deathlord;  Corax is a Raven lord that Flies into Battle,  Ferrus Manus has iron hands. Sanguinus, I'm told becomes vampiric. Angron is angry.  There is a scene in The Two Towers where Aragon pulls himself up when meeting the Rohirrim  and is so majestic and kingly that his will holds sway. The Astartes and Primarch are like that all the time.\n\nPart of the reason I think Warhammer is so good is that they put a lot of historical facts, phrases into the books. One of the book titles is War Without End, which so reminds me of the bible verse that was the inspiration of the Ken Follet novel \"Without End\"; You have a 'Father, why have you forsaken me\" moment as a Primarch falls into rebellion against the Emperor. The first Novel *Horus Rising* has a senior military leadership council that advises Horus is called the Mournival. The four members are not only the Face Cards from a poker deck, but also represent the Four Humors: sanguine, choleric. melancholy, and phlegmatic.\n\nThe Narrative Structure is important. The first three book*s, Horus Rising, False Gods* and *Galaxy in Flames* are linear. They introduce Horus and his legion, his fall to rebellion, his recruitment of other Primarchs, sudden betrayals.  *The Flight of the Eisenstein* overlaps with previous books, covers the same characters  but at different times. *Fulgrim* and  *Legion*  start before *Horus Rising* and track two primarch decision to be loyal or rebel. *Decent of Angels* could be skipped, or serve as a stand alone at this point of my reading. Still good. Great Charactization.  It shows what happens when the Emperor shows up to your planet to and you should have a Tolkien-ish horror at the industrialization.  \n\nThat being said, I do have problems. I think that Horus' fall to rebellion was poorly done. They held out a piece of information from him that should have stopped him from rebelling. They danced around it. This reminded me of one of the Twilight Movies where Edward and Mary Sue had a falling out and an collect call and honest chat could have fixed it. IMO the other Primarch's fall to rebellion that we've seen was more convincing.",

        "text": "Jane Leslie Conly's \"While No One Was Watching.\" Three children are left in the care of an aunt while their dad and his girlfriend work extra hard to afford a new home. However, when the aunt disappears, the children are left to fend for themselves. The eldest, Earl, winds up joining an unscrupulous cousin in illegal work (like bike theft), but things gradually got more dangerous. The book eventually ends on a happy note, though only after the kids had to endure the hardship of neglect.\n\nThe book stuck with me, because it addresses a scenario I could relate to; following the divorce of my parents, when I was little, my father at some point allowed my incubator to take me out of state for the summer of 2000. What followed was a temporary visit with the grandparents on her side of the family in Texas, before being left with some family in Kansas that she only knew through a peer in the military. Some bad things happened that I don't fully recall, nor care to, but ultimately my dad and his father had to rush over from our home state to save me from being put into the foster system; incubator had rarely visited, after leaving me in the care of those strangers, and she eventually disappeared for the remainder of that year (the mother of the strange family couldn't even get in contact with my egg donor, anymore). Needless to say, anytime egg donor contacted again and tried to ask for me or my sisters to go visit her, my dad refused for our safeties.\n\nIt's a bit of an epiphany for me, lately, when revisiting this book made me realize how I was able to relate to it with my own experiences of neglect, during my childhood. My physical copy of this novel is showing its age, but regardless will remain in my personal library for how much I connected with it.",

Definitely did feel bad for her husband, as dumb as he could be sometimes, too.\n\nOne thing (writing-style) that started to mildly bug me: excessive use of the phrase \"she heard herself say/ask.\"\n\nAnyone else read this one?

I went on goodreads and got a lot of conflicting views about it. I’ve been wanting to read Murakami’s works for quite some time as I’ve heard a lot about his books. His genre is not a norm for me so I wanted to know what would you guys recommend. \n\nDo I give it a chance and continue on?\nDo I read another book of his?\n\nIt’s not bad, that’s not what I’m implying. I’m just confused about what is going on.",

I can always find an interesting book or three there. When I go to Barnes and Nobles their books seem much more mainstream and I have a much harder time finding anything that grabs my interest. What would be the correct genres of books I am potentially looking for, or how can i go about finding taboo books or subjects? When searching youtube and google It will obviously only bring up romance novels. Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated!",

One passage in particular hit too close for my recent experience here in the States:\n\n“Alba wondered where so many Fascists had come from overnight, because in the country’s long, democratic history they had not been particularly noticeable, except for a few who got carried away during World War II and thought it amusing to parade in black shirts with their arms raised in salute—to the laughter and hissing of bystanders—and had never won any important role in the life of the country. Nor did she understand the attitude of the armed forces, most of whom came from the middle and working class and had traditionally been closer to the left than the far right.”\n\nIn the context of a coup that results in secret police, dictatorship by the military, and the murder and disappearance of thousands, it’s frightening how fast these folks come out of the shadows. Maybe that element is always within society. \n\nThe ending at least offered a vision of hope that also moved me, but I’ll save that for people who want to read or know how to do spoiler tags lol.

Many think that colonialism is a thing of the past, a dark stain on human history. Butt heads down a different path by defining colonialism as having three key features that persist into modernity. First, the colonial oppressors subjugate a group of people, typically by limiting their say in political and criminal justice decisions. In this case, France defanged the Tunisian government by populating it with French appointees and French allies.\nSecond, the oppressors (according to Butt) wipe out the indigenous culture and replace it with the imposed customs of the colonists. The French achieved this by installing an array of schools where Arab and African chil dren were taught the French language and European culture.\nButt cracks down on the notion of benevolent colonialism with his third defining feature: the oppressors exploit their wards, such as chrough the levying of unfair taxes. France helped itself to Tunisia's natural resources no fund a public health network (including the Pasteur Institute of Tunis), government offices, and roads. All three characteristics, taken together, milt this very serious theory of colonialien, proposed by Professor Butt, hole.",

I've noticed that I  am considerably slow, if I was marked statistically across the  population who regularly read I would probably be on the lower end of  reading speed.\n\nIn some cases I do  this willingly - especially with non-fiction - I am currently reading,  for example, the book The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins. I know that  it is probably well written enough for the average person to glide  through it and understand the biological and evolutionary processes he  states, however I re-read a lot of what he writes, to hopefully (out of  severe compulsion) fully absorb the material he states. Often this works  very well and I am able to explain it to people around me and apply it  to other concepts, however with the rate I am reading it will take me up  to four weeks and even more to finish it (embarrassing I know)!\n\nFor  fiction it is a little different, I am much faster at reading but still  slow in comparison to others. I mainly focus on slower reading to build  an image in my head and have my full attention on the narrative. I am  doing this currently for the Lord of the Rings, having already read The  Fellowship of the Ring in the space of four weeks.\n\nHowever  my main problem is that I will not be able to glide through books as  much as others. I can only hope to read about 12-15 books this year at  this rate, however I see some individuals stating that they read up to  50! How does one improve reading speed whilst still maintaining rigorous  attention? Is this a natural process that builds over time? Are the any  other methods of reading?",

        "text": "I’m sorry, not because I hate her books but because I feel like everyone else on here does too. Whenever I search up a book of hers on here its always someone else going “I didn’t like it either!” but all of the other posts are 300+ days old. My god, These books are so corny and “girl bossy” that they make me cringe in so many ways. I love old hollywood glam and 60s/70s bands and I think both of those concepts are very easy to translate into a storyline with good characters so I was actually excited to read Evelyn Hugo &amp; Daisy Jones. But Damn. These books are bad lmao. Its like she just looks up random famous people and watches one documentary about them and then tries to just create a whole entire story around it. It feels like she doesn’t actually do any research on the actual time periods,how people talked back then,anything! Daisy Jones being a rich white girl growing up in L.A and yet doing the whole entire “Christopher Columbus did not find America!” thing was soooo corny like no rich white girl was saying that in 1967. Her writing is way too on the nose when it comes to political topics and it just comes off as annoying in a “Look how amazing and smart I am!” way. Also the plot twist involving the journalists’ father in Evelyn Hugo was so unneeded and dumb it stunned me. I’m so surprised these books are well liked online, I could understand if you were a 7th grader reading these books but I’m surprised grown adults like them.",

The language is forgettable, a surrealist atmosphere anywhere near the greats (Kafka, Beckett) achieved nor does the heart of the story feel authentic to me. What do we think?",

And it's not like I haven't tried. Somebody recommended me, 'Crime and Punishment' by Fyodor Dostoevsky. I felt asleep just after reading just four pages of that book. Then i decided to read some stuff by Hindi writers like Premchand, the same thing happened again. Then i tried Urdu literature and this time it was the worst, I couldn't read beyond half a page and this is not because I don't have reading proficiency in Urdu, but it's because I was bored af. Then i decided, why not chose a language that I'm most comfortable i.e. Farsi(Persian), after all it's the language i speak at home with my mother. Despite Urdu and Farsi having the same script(Perso-Arabic), the falling asleep pattern continued. I know all of these languages because i do read, it's not like I'm illiterate or something but the stuff i read are mostly news articles or something related to my education. \n\nWell enough of my rant, can anyone share with me some of the experiences that you/someone you know went through like me or I'm the only one out there? Any piece of advice would be most welcome. I want to start reading English literature for improving my writing skills and also because I'm genuinely interested in it. For example, I've no problem reading an in-depth summary of a particular book, the problem persists when i actually start reading that particular book. How can i solve this problem of mine?",

Rongi was also great millitary brat who showed her power quite well. \nI won't put this book only for children it's great YA and i think it's better the Percy Jackson series that I'm currently reading which majorly focuses on action instead of good story. \nAfter Harry Potter this book got me hooked up and making me to read it again.
