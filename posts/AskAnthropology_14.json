At the time, apparently there were competing ideas on the relationship between neanderthals and anatomically modern humans. The professors used a \"biological definition of species\" which meant members of a population who could produce fertile offspring. And if I remember correctly, Europeans have a percentage of Neanderthal DNA in them, meaning there had to be at least some interbreeding. At the same time, homo sapiens originated in Africa whereas there's no indication of Neanderthals having originated outside Europe or the Near East.\n\nI think a lot of what I learned (probably including what I just wrote) is now dated. However, I am curious to see if there have been any significant developments since then. What is the consensus nowadays?",

        "text": "Ever since the evidence of mixing in Eurasia with Neanderthals, I’ve looked at Africa differently. Didn’t similar processes have to be taking place there as H sapiens came together as a species? I think this was a realization many people had, and now it’s becoming the mainstream point of view. See the large collaborative paper recently discussed in this subreddit: https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(18)30117-4\n\nSo I set out to make a video, which turned out to be a set of three about how we got here. What really hit home for me about the history of the field was how confused the situation had been when I first encountered it. Africa had no special place in the story of recent human origins in the 1970s. Paleoanthropologists were struggling with the sparse fossil record of early humans in Africa, Europe and Asia, looking for commonalities and continuities between those fossils and other pre-H sapiens people like Neanderthal and H Erectus.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I came to feel that the transition from confusion about the recent history of H sapiens to the current strong evidence for Africa as the origin place of our species represents a scientific revolution of great significance. I suspect that in retrospect, these last 40 years will be studied by historians of science as case study in scientific change. Agree or disagree?\n\nIf you are interested, I finished the first video about the period before the discovery of mixing with Neanderthals and Denisovans. It’s here: \nhttps://youtu.be/Iy542ANMeMY\n\nIf anyone would like to follow this, I’ll have the second one next Friday on the mixing in Eurasia, and the following Friday on the change from the model of “one small group somewhere in Africa replaced all other hominin groups” to the notion that events and mixings throughout Africa led to our species.",

They have been prominent in the media in the past few weeks due to the passage of a [ban on face veiling in Denmark](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45064237) at the beginning of August, and the [typically tactless comments](http://time.com/5361153/boris-johnson-burqa-muslims/) made by Conservative MP Boris Johnson in the UK in a newspaper opinion piece earlier this week.\n\nI am familiar with some of the academic discussion around veiling in Europe.  I have read some of the work of Saba Mahmood, Lila Abu-Lughod, Leila Ahmed, and others.  My reading has been fairly casual, as it falls well without the wheelhouse of my own academic history.\n\nWhat I have *not* come across, is one or more academic works that are actually based on fieldwork done with women who wear different kinds of veils, giving a direct account of their voices.  Does anyone have any recommendations of papers or books where authors have conducted this kind of fieldwork?  I am after direct interviews with veil-wearing women about their motivations and their understanding of the act of veil wearing, and possibly examination of the written, spoken, or performed voices of such women.\n\nI suspect it is likely that some of the authors I have mentioned above have cited such work, or carried it out themselves but, as I say, my reading of their work has not been comprehensive.  And I'm sure there are many others out there doing work in this area.\n\nI am specifically interested in the Western European context, rather than the American, Middle Eastern, or any other context.  I am also interested in niqab more than any other type of veil, as it is the fullest covering that still seems to have some significant prominence in Western European countries.  Thanks.",

The thing that caught my eye, however, was this quote:\n\n\"[there was] no one to manage the vegetation through regular burnings which prevent devastating wildfires\"\n\nI've tried finding a source for this, but no luck. I was wondering whether anyone else has heard of something similar and can maybe point me in the right direction?\n\nThank you!\n\n",

Is there anything natural about enjoying and appreciating their presence? Or is it socially constructed. A lot of individuals are actually scared of dogs, but is this in itself an instinctive response of being cautious around predators in general (which would have been needed around wolves), or is that relative to the environment of someone's upbringing?",
