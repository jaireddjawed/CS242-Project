        "text": "I am asking this as a true cinephile not as a regular moviegoer. I am an Indian and always think that Great Indian movies are underappreciated in world cinema. Bollywood movies are popular among regular moviegoers, mostly for their musical nature, dance, songs and melodrama, but these movies are not known for filmmaking excellence, hence they rarely got awards at world cinema. We had our auteurs like Satyajit Ray, Bimal Roy, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak, Guru Dutt, Shyam Benegal, Govind Nihlani, Mani Kaul etc, who created excellent cinema. Only Satyajit Ray found popularity outside India. Even today's generation, we have Anurag Kashyap, Vishal Bhardwaj, Mani Ratnam, Sanjay Lila Bhansali, Dibakar Banerjee, Ram Gopal Verma etc. who are known to create great movies, sometimes better than their western counterparts. It is baffling to me that they are rarely recognised in the west for their cinema, not by regular moviegoers, not by critics. Maybe cinephiles deep into world cinema know some of them, but largely they are unknown to the western audiences. \n\nComing to RRR, it is super entertaining. So I am not surprised when western moviegoers enjoy it. It is definitely better than recent Marvel movies. Consider it like an Indian marvel movie. We are known to make these kinds of movies, these are known as masala movies in India. These movies are blockbusters. But as we know, marvel movies are not known to win awards, hence I am surprised why critics are impressed by RRR, which is a very mediocre movie, full of rough edges and broad strokes, hundred miles away from something like Parasite or The Salesman. \n\nWestern critics are known to reject Indian movies in award season, even from the auteurs I mentioned above,  because I want the world to discover their movies, not mediocre stuff like RRR, because RRR is not the best we can make, there is a large library of Indian movies waiting to be discovered by western audience. \n\nCan anyone from the west explain this phenomenon called RRR?",

The focus of the camera and the scenes that follow until Heloise’s face is revealed. The bonfire scene where the women break into a song. Goose fucking bumps. That’s pure cinematic elation. It’s poetically political words and images. That scene where the maid goes to the older woman together with Marianne and Heloise. The romance and the longing. The playfulness. Gorgeously lit and shot images. And that ending. The music and that emotional ending. This is art of highest caliber. Just wanted to share this here.",

        "text": "TÁR is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an unmovable object, both the object and force being the obsession of Lydia Tár.\n\nThe force is her ego and her dictatorial craving, growing more destructive, and more effectively draining the more attention and the deeper into her craft that she delves. This force feeds on the simple prospect of being able to control as much as possible, growing on the thought of fulfilling its own obsession. Unbeknownst to the force, the object that would cause its destruction is actually a side effect of the force. This infinite longing for the fulfillment of this infinitely deep obsession creates with it this gaping emptiness, and the feeling of permanent incompleteness. The gaping emptiness results in everything else than your obsession becoming your enemy. Even in Lydia Tár's case, everyday sound itself becomes the enemy of her own. Eventually her gaping obsession and her rock bottom void collide, and what's left is a shattered human being, unable to escape her self-produced trauma.\n\nTÁR is a brilliant character study on the downfall of a narcissist, allowing for each individual person that watches the downfall to interpret themselves how the downfall was internally manifested.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10dm41b/what_is_a_scene_that_nobody_seems_to_talk_about/",
        "text": "Sometimes, when you look at a movie, you get this one moment that just makes you reflect in what you are seeing and it makes you wanna say things about it. \n\nFor me, I've always been fascinated by this scene of Angel's Egg: https://youtu.be/1h0vPFQhHNY\n\nNot much happens in it. We only see a man sitting next to a girl laying with her egg that she is hoping will hatch a bird (or an angel) and ominous music.\n\nAnd in my opinion, it subtly communicates an important idea about the film's exploration of faith.\n\nA lot of people interpret \"Angel's Egg\" as being a story about losing faith in your religion. The world abandoned by God and the consequences of it. And that holding on to it only brings misery to the person. \n\nHowever, I think the film is also about partially about patience. And I think the film's slow pacing serves as part of expressing that idea. The movie mainly shows the characters wandering around a quiet, dark and abandoned city with some vaguely supernatural things going on around the female protagonist. Not much happens besides a few seemingly eventful moments in the film like the fishermen scene that at first seem to take our characters into a situation but nothing seems to come about it other than quick spectacle and we move on into just more wandering and reflecting about if this egg will hatch something or not.\n\nIn the moment with the most dialogue in the film, we also told that Noah and the animals in the ark have been waiting for the bird to come back for so long, they have \"turned to stone\". The waiting keeps on going and we don't know if it'll ever come to an arrival.\n\nAnd then we have this scene with the man sitting and the girl sleeping. Followed by a small fire by a small fire struggling to enlighten the darkness around these individuals.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a scene shows that faith fading away from the waiting. The fire represents hope/faith. Shining but small and weak. Becoming slightly more intense to then come back to small and smaller illuminations. The rest of the dark room being the world. This fire is what keeps this relationship from crumbling and leading to the end of it all. And the man sits awake, waiting a long with the small fire he has on him while the girl rests oblivious to that waiting. The fire holds on and the man waits until the fire dissipates. And after the fire is gone, the man's patience is also gone and so, he destroys the egg. \n\nThe wait for the hatching is now over and we don't know exactly if there ever was gonna be a angel or not inside. The man refuses to be a stone statue and keeps on wandering by his own while a girl grieves and dies that this long-awaited hatching would no longer come. \n\nHowever, the girl becomes a statue herself as part of the eye of God. She has become so patient for her fate that she no longer is alive. She has transcended to the heavens with the eye of God along with every other faithful statue that decided to wait. And the man is left to wait in this abandoned world. Was the man wrong to not wait and missed his opportunity to  go into a higher plane of existence? Has the girl become forever part of this forever waiting? We don't know.\n\nI also like to point out that the film has a lot of stone statues throughout and the fishermen seemingly are stone statues at first but come to life whenever they need to hunt those shadow fishes. And in my opinion, that also connects to the idea of patience and waiting. \n\nStatues are, after all, completely still and have no sense of time over the things around them. They only serves the role to keep their position in whatever they're build on and only to stay there and nothing can move them act out of their impatience with exception of outside interference like getting moved to some other building for people to see or just get destroyed. But even with that, they are stuck to whatever history or purpose has made them exist as they are. Statues cannot see ahead of their time and it is what dooms to exist only in the history of the past. And just like the egg, destroying it is the only way to end that patience. \n\nThe fishermen are shown as statues in the beginning but then come to life to catch their fishes (faith) only to fail and cause destruction around them and then come back to being stones again. Inevitably failing and coming back to waiting once again as the world drowns around them.\n\nThe girl is in a way, a statue. Waiting for her egg to hatch that will probably never hatch and at the end, we never get to know if something was gonna come out of it and the girl becomes a literal statue out of many in the big, floating mechanical eye.\n\nIn a way, ithe film tells us that faith is a thing that keeps up in the past or from progression. It cripples us into staying in whatever we decided to wait on. And that the only way to keep going is break for the egg, walk and grow. The bird will not fly if it stays in its egg but only when it flaps its wings. The girl does not fly at the end with the eye but is stuck and moved as she is insider her own bubble outside of time and space.\n\nThe contrast as shown from the scene is that the man, while still as a statue, is not staying like that forever. The girl does and she is hopeful where she is. The man with no patience and the woman with an egg to wait for. Either way, both stay as they are in the face of darkness as either way, the world has no hope no matter how much we wait and we won't wait. It's not a matter of time but acceptance.",

        "text": "Abbas Kiarostami's \"Taste of Cherry\" is a deeply moving and thought-provoking film that explores themes of life, death, and the human condition. The film tells the story of Mr. Badii, a middle-aged man who is contemplating suicide and is in search of someone to bury him after his death. Through a series of encounters with different characters, Mr. Badii is forced to confront the complexities of life and the true nature of human existence.\n\nOne of the main themes of the film is the search for meaning in life. Mr. Badii is in a state of despair, feeling that his life is empty and meaningless. Through his encounters with various people, he begins to question his own assumptions about life and death, and ultimately comes to realize that there is more to life than he had previously thought. This theme is exemplified in the final scene of the film, where Mr. Badii watches the sun rise and realizes that life is worth living.\n\nAnother important theme in \"Taste of Cherry\" is the idea of human connection. Throughout the film, Mr. Badii is searching for someone to bury him after his death, but what he ultimately finds is the connection and camaraderie with other people. In his encounters with the various characters he meets, he comes to see that human connection and companionship are essential to our existence. This theme is exemplified in the scene where Mr. Badii spends the night with the soldier, where they talk and share stories, and Mr. Badii realizes that he is not alone in his struggles.\n\nThe film's cinematography and direction also deserve a special mention, as they are used to great effect to convey the themes of the film. The use of long shots and wide angles, as well as the use of natural light, creates a sense of emptiness and isolation that reflects Mr. Badii's inner state. The use of silence and the absence of music also contribute to the sense of isolation and contemplation that is prevalent throughout the film.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Taste of Cherry\" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that explores themes of life, death, and the human condition. Through its portrayal of a man in search of meaning in life, the film encourages us to question our own assumptions about life and to appreciate the beauty and value of human connection. The film's direction and cinematography are also masterful, and contribute to the film's powerful and emotive impact. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, and one that is worth watching multiple times.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10dh1sx/avatar_is_much_deeper_complex_and_unique_than/",
        "text": "Yea, so I'm just gonna flat out say that I think a lot of the specifically Reddit *discourse surrounding James Cameron's Avatar relies on frequently bad faith interpretations of the narrative, arguably pointless and intentionally belittling comparisons to vaguely similar stories, a conscious refusal to actually engage with the themes explored in Avatar and its sequel, and imo it almost comes down to something like a reactive rejection of Avatar's general message, (essentially boiling down to imperialism, corporatism, and devouring the Earth actually is bad, but explored on pretty interesting philosophical, political, and spiritual grounds). I also think people reject Avatar due to the fact that it is, in fact, a relatively unique little story and self-contained universe that doesn't really rely on an established IP or massive franchise to work on it's own grounds.\n\nNow I want to start with a discussion topic fresh on my mind, that being the character of Jake Sully and his transformation into one of the Navi, the people. I think the journey of Jake Sully ties into most of the themes and complexity of the plot of Avatar. The thing is, one of the most unfair criticisms of Jake is that he is a generic action protagonist. I would say he is pretty far from it actually, Jake I would say has relatively little in common with most mainstream Western action heroes. Jake, unlike plenty of heroes like the A-Team, James Bond, Rambo, the cast of the majority of war films, Dutch (Predator), the colonial marines from Aliens, etc is not, as a hero, in the employ of the US (or UK) militaries, but a defector from and opponent of it. Jake is also not any sort of criminal like John Wick, most assassin heroes, or the main characters of your average crime film, instead he goes from being a soldier to a disciple of another culture to a leader in that culture. Jake Sully is actually more comparable to Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter, a seemingly average individual sent on a hero's journey after being taken into a strange new world by an individual already familiar with this world; except unlike Harry Potter or Luke or many heroes/\"Chosen Ones\" Jake truly is a nobody, he doesn't have especially amazing or specific skills, he didn't end up on Pandora due to destiny but rather morbid coincidence, and it can be argued that Eywa chose Jake because he was basically an average nobody on Earth, more specifically he was the first human it encountered that was truly open to the ways of the Navi.\n\nThis brings us to the topic of why Jake chose Pandora over \"Earth\", and it relates to why Eywa chose Jake to be its \"Chosen One\" in the first fight against the Sky People. Basically I think there are pretty bad faith arguments that Jake chooses Pandora and the Navi because of a girl, or just because the planet is prettier. Truthfully, Jake experiences in immense and life changing spiritual and political awakening through the Avatar transformation and learning the ways of the Navi. Essentially, on Pandora Jake realizes for the first time in his life genuine freedom, and he also realizes for the first time that for his entire life he was a slave. What makes Jake's story and the plot of Avatar work so well is how much it connects with, well, the real world. Even in the 2100s you can see people like Jake around, vets hired as dogs for the military sent to kill their fellow man in foreign lands then tossed away like trash once he was broken. As Jake says in the opening narration, spinal injuries are totally fixable in the future, but only if you can pay for it. Think how this relates to the many other conditions homeless veterans suffer with, that are fixable in our times. Before being a dog of war, Jake was probably a typical wage slave as well, you could say an entirely menial and underwhelming and arguably sad life, yet Jake toughs it out anyway.\n\nOn Pandora Jake first experiences freedom in the form of finally regaining the freedom to use a body unbroken again, legs that can walk, a body that can move. He experiences life before chaining his fate to whatever military sent him to fight in Venezuela. Next, Jake, in interacting with the Navi people, begins to recognize the freedom afforded by direct interaction with nature, something now impossible on his Earth. There are immense dangers in this natural world, fierce and massive predators, people who can sometimes be foes as well as friends, the need to acquire what one needs to survive, and yet with this Jake comments he actually knows where his food is coming from when hunting in his avatar body, on this world Jake experiences the truly interconnected web of life as well, which is gone on his Earth, and Jake witnesses the seemingly transcendent beauty of nature, which awed humanity on Earth from the beginning as it awes the Navi, and Jake begins to recognize how hideous and alien the RDA and military constructs are in comparison, almost like a total inversion of nature.\n\nThis leads to Jake's first real philosophical and political transformation. In living on Pandora Jake finally realizes he was a slave, in his old body a slave to his wound, but also, he was a slave his entire life, as a soldier, as a worker before that, as a child in school. Jake was never free, and life was never easy either. On Pandora life can be and is sometimes difficult, but unlike on Earth Jake and the people there are free. Jake begins to realize how absurd the world he came from actually was, on his homeworld he struggled to survive, but not due to bare scarcity but solely social constructs. His own twin brother was murdered for cash during a mugging, Jake sums it up as all his brother ever could have been destroyed for materially worthless paper. In the pursuit of fulfilling essentially a social construct Jake's own people destroyed their own habitat and are now dying. And specifically Jake's people, i.e. America and equivalent Great Powers, distant power hungry authorities that sent Jake to kill his own brothers and sisters that lived in different lands, because no Jake doesn't reject or hate humanity, he rejects the imperialist and corporate structures ruling humanity, these are very separate things. The point isn't that humans are evil, not even the people from these Great Powers are evil, it's the states and corporate structures. On Earth Jake is alone in a crowd full of people, on Pandora Jake's always surrounded by people who have actual developed relationships and knowledge of each other. On Earth Jake struggled to survive despite never going on a hunt. On Earth Jake killed his fellow man under the command of distant authorities he didn't even know, who didn't care if he lived or died, who tossed him away after his servitude had ended and only reached out to him again by happenstance. Earth is ruled by people who had subjugated all other cultures on their planet, pillaged said planet to the point of collapse, and must now parasitically feed on another world (destroying/subjugating the native unalienated populace to do so) to save their own civilization from the consequences of its crimes against humanity and the Earth\n\nThis brings us to the third major themes of Avatar, which involve Jake's spiritual awakening. Something discounted by critics of the film is that much of the stories deepest layers center around the spiritual transformation of Jake Sully, which finally ties the surface level story, other layers of themes explored, and the final surprisingly complex and, imo, previously unexplored messages of Avatar. As outlined previously, Jake is first of all a nobody so he is open to the ways of the Navi and teachable, second Jake undergoes a complex political transformation on Pandora that actually makes a lot sense based on everything in the narrative, now this political transformation, namely the experience of freedom and realization of the falseness of his own previous beliefs and upbringing, and the especially the wrongness of his society, Jake chooses to truly accept the Navi's spiritual beliefs, truly joining the people, winning Neytiri's heart, and becoming the one Chosen by Eywa to lead the Navi against the Sky people. See, it is fair to state that the spiritual beliefs of the Navi are essentially correct, Eywa is what the Navi call the planetary neural connection that the scientists note definitely exists; the biosphere of Pandora is essentially a conscious interconnected superorganism, connected on a biological level by the neural tentacles all plants and animals possess. This does not mean life lives simply in harmony, evidently predators and prey relations exist, as due extinction and adaptation cycles. However overtime all life on the planet evolved to become something of a superorganism. Now, if Mother Earth is essentially real on Pandora, since the combined neural links form a consciousness, really the Navi belief system is essentially correct and it is merely a matter of perception. In this is the spiritual implication of Jake Sully's society, and the civilization that rules Earth. The Navi refer to the humans and especially the avatars as \"demons\" from time to time, and depending on your perspective they're sort of right. From a secular perspective humans are space aliens on Pandora, but from a spiritual perspective they're truly strange conscious beings from an entire other realm who possess strange powers unlike anything you've seen, whose every ability seems a contradiction of Eywa, to the point that they cannot connect with her in their natural form or even breathe her air, they create uncanny vessels meant to deceive the Navi in bizarre unliving pods, and their intention is essentially to destroy or subdue Eywa's people and then devour Eywa herself. If humans almost are literal demons from the Navi perspective, then Earth's civilization, or Corporatism more precisely is basically the Devil, and as Jake explains to Neytiri, humanity killed their own mother. Only Jake could come to this understanding, even the scientists who respected and admired the Navi could not think like the Navi, they could not join Eywa, Jake was the first fully open to it. As Jake says, he begins to feel that in his avatar body he experiences true life, and as a human he is dreaming. Neytiri falls in love with Jake because he is curious and open towards her culture and herself as an individual, truly wants to understand what she believes, is emotionally open and kind, and is truly willing to give up his life and everything he knew to protect the people and Eywa.\n\nWhich finally all ties into Cameron's message in the film, that, essentially, the Navi and the indigenous cultures they are indeed meant to evoke were, in many ways correct, and it merely depends on your perspective. Life actually is all interconnected on Earth, organisms interact to form ecosystems, ecosystems interact with each other to form the biosphere, the biosphere interacts with the elements of Earth to form the entire Earth system of living and non-living elements interacting. These systems are highly complex and self-sustaining as well as interdependent, each part functions but also relies on the existence of the system as a whole, from the multicellular human body, to the entire Earth system, Cameron's point is that Eywa is real on Earth as she is on Pandora, and just as the Navi are part of her, humans are too. And that this social system humans have created, is as much a living system, but a cancerous one, devouring the system humans naturally lived within and developed in, the biosphere, that in spiritual terms it does make us demons doing the bidding of a Devil devouring our God. However in Jake being a nobody, a fucking wage slave drone and military grunt Jake shows it is not that humans are bad, most people are not even free, people are alienated from the life on their own world, from each other, and from themselves, essentially worshipping Death and Power as gods while ignoring the true world around them, and yet any person can be Jake Sully, all it takes is being willing to reject what you were led to believe and taking a stand against imperialism, the sad alienation of people from their own world, emotional and communal alienation, and especially the corrupting influence of corporate power on human society.\n\nTL; DR: Lack of \"witty\" semi-ironic, self-referntial Marvel humor, \"grimdark realism\", vague similarity to other stories, and a \"preachy\" (actually important and anti-individualist) messages =/= a shallow or crappy film",

        "text": "I am turning 44 in a month. Every year I like to screen a film with a few friends for my birthday. I don’t know why I’ve waited on this one for so long, being as it is likely my favorite film of all time. I am planning on saying a few words about the film, prior to the viewing. The words represent my thoughts on the film over all, points of identification with the plot, specific performances and a few brief comments on the film making. Leading up to this I have read most threads on Reddit that I can find on the film. Figured I’d post one more, toss my thoughts out there to the entirety of the internet and see what comes back.  Maybe I’ll modify my writing based on additional thoughts that may arise in this thread.\n\n________\n\nThank you for coming to my screening of PT Andersons, Magnolia. Released under the shadow of Y2K in 1999, what we have is an often overlooked masterpiece of modern film making. \n\nPresented with an ensemble cast it’s my conclusion, each character we meet and follow represents a small piece of each of us. Each character, in their own way, is seeking the one thing that often alludes humanity the most, redemption. \n\nSome characters find it, others don’t but in many ways, in this life, we are never fully redeemed. As such, what Andersons masterpiece leaves us with, which by the credits remains largely unresolved, is a full picture of a human, in all its forms, trying to resolve a past that isn’t quite finished yet. \n\nThings to note - \n\nUnlike most movies Magnolia, the film, is a work of art. It’s a work of art that is supported by a tension and release score that pervades most every scene, and seems to move in time with Andersons fast pace &amp; minimal-cut cinematography. \n\nA career peak performance of Frank TJ Mackey as played by Tom Cruise. Cruise’s performance is further supported by a master portrayal of Hospice Nurse Phil Parma, as played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. \n\nThe subtle performance of Rose Gator as played by Melinda Dillon, who brings a fierce undercurrent to a character waking up to the madness of family trauma that has long been covered up by time, money &amp; fame. \n\nAnd…\n\nWilliam H. Macy who speaks for us all when he says “My name is Donny Smith and I have a lot of love to give.” \n\nMagnolia is much more a film to be experienced than it is to be analyzed. We all have families and must explore what went wrong before we can truly move forward. I read once that, in part, Magnolia can be a film about dads. If nothing else, allow this film to wash over you as we stare into the abyss that is fatherhood in all of its beauty, sadness, rage, terror, betrayal and glory. \n\nAnd with that, I give you Paul Thomas Andersons - Magnolia",

Be it from plot contrivances, potholes, editing, cinematography, thematic meaning, etc.\n\nPersonally, \"Memento\" (my favorite movie ever) is for me a nearly flawless film where even errors look like intentional additions that connects to the themes of the film that talks about just how unreliable our brains due to imperfect memory and also personal bias but if there is one problem with it, it is that just like basically many of Nolan's films, it does not have the best representation of a female character with Leonard's wife, who literally just exists to give the main character a motive to get revenge and has not much of a character at all. Literally her most defining trait is that she likes reading. Otherwise, we don't know this woman besides the fact that she loves Leonard and she is with Leonard. And it's obviously not a new issue that sometimes, female characters are pretty disposable and exist for the male characters but yeah, not a huge flaw in this movie or done much worse than it could've been done, in my opinion and I kinda accepted it but yeah, it is there. And at least it does have a decent female antagonist in the film. And you could also argue that it doesn't make much sense that he somehow created the Sammy Jenkins story to hide the fact that he killed his wife and was actually Jenkins all along since he has no memories after the brain injury but I got my contrived reasons for how he could make up the story.\n\n\"Ritual\" is a I consider to be Hideaki Anno's best work despite not even being animated and also an excellent portrayal of toxic codependent relationships, trauma and depression. And while it very consistently has some of the most gorgeous cinematography I've seen in any and a lot of shots I consider iconic, it does have some weird moments that use a lot of CGI and are meant to be fantasy sequences. It does not look very good honestly and it doesn't fit much visually with the rest of the film which looks practically perfect.\n\n\"Perfect Blue\" is among my favorite animated films of all time and the most influential film in the sense that it made me want to explore more meaningful cinema. But if there is something that bothers me about it, it's that if you pay attention to the animation, it can have multiple moments where it looks kinda dopey and incomplete like how there can be a whole ground of people in the concert and they all just have no faces and look like more detailed stick figures. And a lot of moments in which you can see people in the background like not moving at all and like they just put a bunch of mannequins to be figures of people. And tbh, it probably is the worst animation out of any Kon film I've seen even if it's my favorite from film. I think the strength comes from the symbolism, themes and psychological horror of the film.\n\nBut yeah, these are some examples. What would be some for your films, in your opinion?",

        "text": "I always apreciatte big interpretations. And I mean literal BIG acting, where an actor has to release all their emotions, burst in front of the camera in a specific scene. It usually happens when they have to show either anger or sadness. \n\nAnd I'm not talking about overacting. I'm talking about good actual interpretations, by talented and recognised actors who are living in their characters skin. They aren't doing anything wrong. The staging, the dialogue and the acting is right, yet, you are taken out of the scene - out of the immersion. \n\nIt's a pretty shitty sensation, and it usually happens to me with almost every movie that I see. Is it me? I don't know. Because I know the actor is doing a great job portraying the emotions, but the acting is so BIG, that is inevitable to be taken out and think \"Wow! This actor is doing a pretty good job!\". \n\nThe only way to escape this is by subtle acting, which of course can't be used all the time, but it works for movies like Aftersun (to give a recent example) \n\nAnother common thing is to be taken out of the movie because of the cinematography, although this just happens to me (and I suppose to many others) because we aren't just watching a movie, we are inevitably analyzing it, because we love cinema and we want to apreciatte the director's job. At least happens to me: I'm watching a scene and suddenly \"Hey! There you are using a low angle for that shot, I suppose you want to tell me this character is the powerful one... gotchaa...\" \n\nNow, getting back to subject. I think, the reason this may happen, is because many of this movies I watch them on my TV, at my home. You have distractions, even when everything is dark, there's still a light, a sound, a shadow... there's always something that makes you aware. \n\nOn a theather, despite some noise the public makes with their popcorn or so, there's no escape from the screen. The actors face is now big. The screen is so big, there's no even room for distraction, even for darkness. Thus, less probable distractions. \n\nMaybe it's just me lol, maybe I think too much and should relax more. The best thing that can happen though, is when you are aware that you are watching a movie and your are being told a story, and you still believe the character. For example, right now I'm watching Breaking Bad, and realised Bryan Cranston is one of the few actors that erase from the screen when I'm watching the series. I'm always watching Walter White, there's no way there's an actor behind. And everytime I make a comment, I don't think about Cranston, I think about Mr. White. \n\nI know it's kinda messy, and long, and now it's late and I'm tired of writing. Give me your thoughts on this, thanks!",

        "text": "***Disclaimer: I want to say that this is not at all a dismissal of the very real effects triggering material can have on someone who has undergone mental/physical trauma, and I am also not dismissing the severity of sexual assault. If the scene upsets you for those reasons, that is more than valid.*** \n\nI've been watching something very strange happen within the discourse of this movie, sometimes even with people I greatly admire the opinions of. That is of course, the infamous scene within A Clockwork Orange. For those who have seen it, they know how horrific it is, \"singing in the rain\" is sung out loud while they very graphically sexually assault a woman as they all laugh along and treat it as a joke. \n\nIt seems like a lot of people at the time understood it's intentions, however now the light it's viewed in is different. A lot of people think that the scene is needlessly edgy, and isn't taken seriously enough. This is what I want to contend, as someone who has absorbed this media to heart. I have read the original Burgess novella 2 times, and watched the Kubrick films countless times. \n\nThe meaning of \"A Clockwork Orange\", is within it's vague titling. An orange naturally does not have clockwork, and the idea of forcing an orange to work that way is counter-intuitive to the purpose of an orange (I believe the author has even referenced this much.) However, the message it's trying to convey is a lot more obvious and on the nose in the books. Our main character Alex is absolutely deplorable, and the goal was clearly to make him as unlikeable as possible. He commits almost every universal wrong imaginable in the book, and it goes into way more detail, such as assaulting a vulnerable old lady, to comitting pedophilia, and to the act which is the current discussion. The material is written from Alex's point of view, and such these matters are treated as trivial, as they most likely are in Alex's life. \n\nThe meaning of this becomes a lot clearer in it's later acts, and such makes the later acts so incredibly impressive. The fall of Alex's life somehow makes us root for him on *some* level. Now that Alex has been \"fixed\", and is literally incapable of comitting the same acts he used to, despite the fact that the previous Alex was objectively worse for society, we want the old Alex back on some level. This is why this material is so incredible, it's basically witchcraft that they can pull this off. That we can find ourselves rooting for someone so despicable and wrong, someone that we dislike with strong intensity. That's what makes it so fascinating, and it obviously has a deeper meaning than just being an incredible flex.\n\nBurgess is trying to lead us to our logical conclusions, that one must change on their own accord, rather than forcing people to do so by acts of punishments. We would never buy this conclusion if Alex wasn't the horrible disgusting monster that he is, he needs to be the worst type of person there is, to show us that there is no exceptions to this rule. There is no one person who is deserving of punishment and cruelty, and we must use our correctional facilities to rehabilitate rather than punish. \n\nNow however, that is the book. I understand that Kubrick's interpretation is another beast. Maybe it could be argued that Kubrick did not do a good enough job of showing this to the audience correctly, and maybe Kubrick's choice of incredibly stylized and surreal, wacky imagery may distract away from the core message.  However, I think the scene is technically doing it's job correctly by creating such a wild, angry and vile distaste towards Alex, as that is the goal. The message would not work if we rooted for Alex at all at the beginning, that runs opposite to the entire goal of the movie. \n\nIt makes critiques such as \"rape is played off for laughs\" so confusing to me. Yes, the main character is laughing, and yes, they treat it as a light-hearted sport. But that's not supposed to be funny to you, the viewer. It's supposed to be disturbing, that an act so incredibly serious and vile could be treated as a joke. The problem could be in the fact that Kubrick cut off the novellas ending, which showed Alex as having a desire to change, which he came too by his own accord seeing an old friend start a family. In the movie however, none of that is shown, and it is much more vague as to whether Alex will ever change his ways or not.\n\nI am by no means claiming that I have the 'correct' interpretation, and I welcome discourse and discussion. I however admire A Clockwork Orange for having the balls to do what it does, and that doesn't come from the fact it depicts disgusting crimes against nature, but because it dares us to look inwards and ask if we truly believe in revenge and punishment, and where that line is. If you felt absolutely 0% sympathy towards Alex and was laughing gleefully at the torture he goes through in the second half, then that has answered a question for you, you know where you stand on rehabilitation vs punishment. However I believe it means that it's done it's job correctly as a great piece of art, which is to question your own morality, and spark such discussion and discourse in the first place.",

For a local artist using the Ai generator Midjourney managed to show still images of the unfinished work of Alejandro Jodorowsky's Tron with coloring and everything.  Note, this work was never prodcued nor storyboarded. This is the begining of serious implications for possibly filmmaking with the influence of Ai in the future.

Though while I would rarely criticize someone for their own personal meaning that they drew from art, there is something to be said about ruining mystery (as shown with Tyler’s Bullshit). The Menu itself was very messy, it couldn’t decide whether it was goofy or serious, though intermittently it got great moments across. While I may not have entirely agreed with the film, it admittedly brings up some provoking critiques of critique.",

And I just watched the sequel, and I'm honestly surprised at the praise it's received. It was pretty disappointing, even cringe at times. Who else feels this way?\n\nSo, I love the first Avatar and still defend it to this day. I think its aged well and is truly a great cinematic achievement. I even think the screenplay and story were great, which for a lot of people that was their main complaint with the first one.\n\nI finally saw the second one a few days ago. After seeing the general positive response by both critics and audiences I was expecting it to be at least as good as the first. It was not. Not even close.\n\nMy main complaints are the fact that it was essentially a rehash of the first movie. Literally, entire scenes and interactions were just lifted from the first movie and rehashed. Only difference was that it was kids/teenagers this time and it was a different environment. Some of the underwater shots were great, but overall, visually, the movie felt a little flat. I feel like the first film looked better and it came out 13 years ago.\n\nOverall, I just felt like the story was kind of sloppy and almost all the characters (especially the humans) were just walking stereotypes. Some of the dialogue was very cringe. I dont know. I still love James Camerons work, but I cant believe hes aiming to make FIVE of these movies, especially after this one just felt flat.\n\nIll still see the next one, but my expectations are significantly lowered.

As opposed to the immaculate visual styles of Citizen Kane, Raging Bull, and even more niche picks like Satantango, Eraserhead, and any Wes Anderson flick, Barry Lyndon’s appearance is the most consistent yet surprising example I have ever beheld. There are few still frames of this film that wouldn’t make incredible additions to a mid 18th century art gallery, and in the few moments the camera isn’t painting a masterpiece it is embodying the chaos and instability of Barry’s story at that point. Kubrick’s combination of natural lighting and artificial lighting through windows and candles is very intentionally used to replicate the works of the piece’s time. In particular the tracking shot of Captain Potzdorf walking through the Prussian lines embodies the chaos of that scene perfectly, while the still shots of the gambling scenes and the opening shot of the duel. PLEASE if anyone has a different film they think is shot better comment below, I’d love to discuss this topic at further length.\n\nFor me, this movie is an easy 9/10 on the cinematography alone but the honestly slightly lacking lead performance from Ryan O’Neal keeps it there for me.",

        "text": "This Jake Gyllenhaal crime thriller subverts the normal action packed tropes of the modern police thriller by trapping us in the 911 call center with our main character, and I believe this is much more than a gimmick in the broader scheme of the film’s theme. This movie’s central idea (in my opinion) is the relinquishing of control. Joe Baylor has no control over what Emily and Henry do, over the custody of his daughter, and ultimately the outcome of his trial. This lack of control is emphasized by the claustrophobic portrayal of the 911 call center, especially as the story escalates and Joe isolates himself in a dark back room. Joe spends the film fighting his lack of control over the “hostage” situation until the twist is sickeningly revealed through his conversation with Emily, and this is ultimately where our main character realizes the only answer to his lack of control is the acceptance of it. This ultimately brings him to plead to Rick to tell the truth in court, instead of prop up the lie that would put him back in the line of duty. I believe The Guilty is a shamefully overlooked masterpiece with an incredible performance from Gyllenhaal who’s range in this film highlights the painful journey of relinquishing control over one’s life.\n\n8.7/10\n\nGreat plot and amazing lead performance but cinematography leaves some to be desired.",

The masterful sound design makes every little footstep build the terror that lasts for up to 30 minutes to finally be released. Never have I jumped so hard from a falling barbie doll.

        "text": "Hoping some movie buff here could help me out.\n\nSorry, there's very little to go on. I saw these a very long time ago, when I was a kid. I would very much like to watch them again.\n\nMovie 1:\n\n20th century South Asian movie, in black and white, concerning some independence movement. This one is supposed to be a world classic movie, I think. The main protagonist is imprisoned by the British for some kind of seditious activity. He's always smiling. He sits around all day in his prison cell making tea, drinking tea and smoking weed, which he hides judiciously under a rug. There are protracted scenes lasting several minutes, of him making tea in his cell. One day, a prison guards steals his spliff. He deals with it with aplomb and great tactfulness and diplomacy, and the prison guard is ashamed and hands it back. He tends to a flower garden in the prison courtyard. He sometimes composes some (truly awful) poetry, and sings it at the wall which separates his prison grounds from the female prison. At the end of the movie, he is released and the country (whichever South Asian country it is) is granted independence. Sorry, that's all I've got to go on.\n\nMovie 2:\n\nSet in the 1980s, either in India or in America or Britain. There is a brahmin Indian family with a great heritage. Every single one of them except one is depraved, because of their tendency towards modernisation and westernisation. They're womanisers, liars, addicts and drunks. The one who is unaffected remains aloof from them all, and sits alone in his room, wearing the sacred thread and listening to (western) classical music on his record player. He takes great pleasure in music, and detaches himself from the world through music. The movie sort of indicates he doesn't reject western culture, but only immorality and depravity. He stays away from his family members and they feel ashamed when in his presence, and they come to hate him because he doesn't lie, and says that lies are poison, etc. He gets chronically depressed. The movie makes a commentary on the loss of morality of the old Indian upper (religious) class, through his character. It's a pretty morose movie. I thought it was great though. Powerful.\n\nThat's it. Thanks in advance",

Yes, Siobhán is correct; Colm isn’t as intelligent as he pretends to be. However, that doesn’t make his point less valid. Colm is reaching old age, and he wants to make his days meaningful. What’s wrong with that? Granted, it hurts to lose a friend so abruptly, especially when you’ve done nothing wrong (I’ve been there, myself). However, a person doesn’t owe you an explanation for ending a friendship, yet Colm did explain, Padriac just couldn’t accept the answer. This is more closure than most of us ending friendships get in real life. And then Padriac burns his whole house down because of an accident with his donkey, that Padriac couldn’t prevented by just leaving Colm alone? How is Colm the bad guy. Because what he said was blunt? I don’t get it. Would love to hear your opinions.",

It's also very apparent that it is shot on a set and I think all of this was done on purpose. Anyways, I'm not versed in film knowledge to to know why the film reminds me of Gunsmoke or Bonanza or even the Spaghetti Westerns. I'd be grateful if someone could shed some light on this!

        "text": "So my inspiration for this post is the response to an earlier post of mine, where people were upset that I called Al Pacino in *The Godfather* unattractive. While I like many movies with actors that are conventionally or personally (to me) unattractive, it seems rather obviously to be the case that sex appeal is one of many possible things to enjoy about a movie (the problem with the *Godfather* is that it offers nothing whatsoever to entice or entertain us). At the same time, there is the sense that art is supposed to aspire to something more than pornography, and there is even an apparent political problem with excessive focus on eroticism: are ugly people less interesting? Should we be content with such a superficial way of relating to others? These questions can be expanded, formulated with more or with less nuance, set within certain limits, etc., but the issue seems to remain thorny however you dress it. We'd all like to think that we are \"above\" judging people for the way that we look, but certain actors and performances will remind us on a very (below the) gut level that we are after all human beings with (for most of us, anyway) functioning genitalia, and the erotic dimension to a film is often so powerful that it becomes an integral structural component such that the rest of the movie would collapse if we were to abstract from it.\n\nThe two examples I gave in my previous post were Fassbinder's *Querelle* and Leone's *The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly*. In each case, it is impossible to imagine what would be left of the film if the erotic aspect were taken away. This might be most obvious in the case of *Querelle,* which is very directly and literally framed as an exploration of gay lust removed from all moral and political concerns. This is hardly unique in gay or \"queer\" cinema, but it's probably one of the most extreme examples as well as one of the most immediately titillating. It also has plenty more going for it than just this: a dreamy surreal quality, beautiful colors, deliberately artificial acting and staging, simply bizarre performances such as Moreau's Wilde-influenced song, various juxtapositions and allusions (Plutarch, for example). Nonetheless, they are all grounded firmly in a pornographic base. At the same time, it is by far Fassbinder's most enjoyable film, lightyears ahead of the unwatchable Petra von Kant. \n\nWhat masks the eroticism of Leone's film is its status as a traditional \"straight guy's film\". It is one of those movies that appeals both to cineastes and to popular audiences: everybody and their dad has seen it. But if you watch it as somebody who is attracted to men, then the most striking effect it has is upon one's loins. Clint Eastwood in his Leone roles might be literally the most attractive man ever to appear on film (movies such as Dirty Harry are a totally different story and don't even deserve to be mentioned). Not only that, but there is some clear erotic tension between his character and Tuco's. The sexual overtones of my response to the film have intrigued me since I first saw it, and I've had a few conversations with straight male friends and coworkers to try to understand what the movie means to *them* as opposed to *me*. In every case, I get the same basic response: while I would like very much to have sex with the man with no name, every straight man I have talked to claims that he wants to *be* Clint Eastwood's character. In other words, he is the kind of person that women (and gay men) want to be with and men want to be (I think that's how the saying goes). But both responses are two sides of the same coin: they both result from the same kind of idealization of a stoic, rugged, classically handsome and eminently masculine character who is nonetheless generally sympathetic and charismatic; the difference is just in how one stands in relation to that ideal. So even if \"erotic\" or \"sexy\" is not the first word that comes to mind for many straight men watching the movie, their own enjoyment is just the obverse of the basically pornographic appeal it has to people like me, confirming that it is essentially an erotic film.\n\nWhile it is mainstream Hollywood films that are most often criticized for objectifying women or overvaluing conventional beauty, it really can't be denied that this is still hugely present in \"art films\" where I suppose sex also sells. I mean Anna Karina, Catherine Deneuve, Jeanne Moreau, Harriet Andersson.... from Godard to Bunuel to Bergman and beyond, beautiful women have been a key feature of cinema's aesthetics. Guy Maddin is a bit unique in offering some kind of fan service to his gay viewers, often selecting especially handsome men and placing them in steamy situations. The point is, sex is always present, and to some extent, removing it would even falsify and sanitize the experience. A sexless, sterile picture might be as much a \"lie\" as a conventional Hollywood thriller that capitalizes entirely on its actor's looks. So I guess I'm wondering in very general terms, leaving this open to all kinds of responses, what you think about the place for sexuality in cinema, about what it is that distinguishes an art film from exploitation or pornography, whether you think there is a political or social-moral component to the question, whether sex is given too much or too little importance, and so on. Will there come a time when external, physical attractiveness is simply no longer an issue in a movie, because we have all moved on from such superficial concerns? Is it fundamentally different from other modes of beauty and can the aesthetic experience as such be neatly distinguished as a \"higher\" form of beauty from base concerns with people's looks?",

        "text": "If i'm honest I don't even know where to start. During my viewing of this film I liked it, but it was after it finished that I realized how insanely good it was.\n\nIt's a very depressing film, which deeply touched me on an emotional level. I always thought people where exaggerating when they say that they keep staring at the screen after a film is finished... well, this happened to me after the final scene. That last word in the final scene hit so hard that I was lost for words. To end the films with that word, in that scene, after all we've seen prior to that scene, has to be one of the best and most impactful endings I've ever experienced.\n\nThe cinematography is just as strong as the story and plot. The way they seemlessly shot and framed the surrealistic elements was really well done, which heavily contributed to the visual storytelling. The storytelling and visual storytelling were two completely seperate entities, but when combined became one beautiful manifestation of perfection. This is exactly the reason why Synecdoche New York has so much rewatch value.\n\nThe blocking of the characters, especially the main character, created an intimacy between the viewer and the main character Caden Cotard. A character that is masterfully played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Because we are so intimate with Caden, we also have a stronger connection with his emotions and the situation he is in. I even reflected my own emotions upon his situation, which is something I rarely do.\n\nThe score is an important element in films for me, because music is a language that speaks to the emotions... an aspect that is very important in this film. Luckily, the score in Synecdoche New York did not disappoint on that front. It was a very moving score that tells the viewer how Caden was feeling during that exact moment of his life.\n\nAfter the powerful ending this film has grown on me a lot... and it is continuing to do so even more.",

I don't know much about it, and never thought much about it until recently.\n\nI'm sure that I watched something that came out recently where the aspect ratios changed between scenes, square to widescreen and back.  I'm drawing a blank on what it was.\n\nThen, I saw The Whale (no spoilers) today and it's projected in what looks like more of a 4:9 square aspect ratio instead of 16:9 or 21:9 widescreen rectangle.\n\nI usually think of the square format to be more like older media from tv shows from the 90s on today's TVs.   \n\nIt thew me off for a minute because I wasn't used to seeing black bars on the sides of the picture at a theater. I thought about it off and on throughout, would the viewing experience be different if it were a rectangle?\n\nI think it would be in this case.  The squareness added to this feeling of being stuck in a small, single space which enhanced the setting for The Whale.  Then I wondered if it was just me overthinking it,  maybe that aspect ratio had nothing to do  with what I was feeling. \n\nBut why do you think a modern film would use this aspect ratio?  Why would a director pick the square over the rectangle? \n\nAre there other films you know of that are intentionally presented in this way? It also made me try to think of other ones that mightve been better (or felt differently) if they were 4:9 instead of widescreen.",

Their romantic interaction is odd and feels slightly 'off'; Keng initiates most of the physical gestures and romantic declarations, but Tong does not rebuff them. We see Tong at work, and his dog being taken to the vet, but we don't spend enough time with these characters to become fully invested, involved or even interested in their story.\n\nThe film then changes track to a completely different (but perhaps related?) story of a solider in a jungle hunting a mysterious spirit that can change into an animal, in this instance a tiger. The soldier is played by the same actor as Keng, with the spirit-man being played by Tong's actor. I definitely found this part more interesting, there was more to read in what was happening. The use of voiceover to add to the story's narrative seemed a little heavy-handed, but did at least guide me in what exactly what was going on. \n\nOverall, 'Tropical Malady' didn't entirely work for me. I appreciated its loose-structure, and use of mystical stories but ultimately there just wasn't enough to really grab me or fully interest me here.",

But if you aren't a TL;DR, and love movies, here's some words! I always worry it's super dorky and cringey for a long form text post, but hey... why not!? =)\n\nI realized it's an interesting thought exercise in the context of my personal love of movies and upgrading to a 4K player and 4K TV. The stuff I picked up definitely dovetails with my all time favorites. I've got to assume many of us that are still purchasing media are rebuying stuff we have owned in multiple ways over time? So I'm also going to assume the first 4K media you picked up is also probably some of your favorite films of all time!\n\nI'm listing the first six I immediately picked up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#1\n\nThe first I bought was John Carpenter's The Thing. I am still bummed and somewhat confused how a masterpiece like The Thing didn't turn into a bigger intellectual property like Predator (Prey was superb now let's do feudal Japan) or Terminator or literally any of the other stuff. Even Halloween!! Anyhoo... There is a great making of the thing on YouTube. Rob Bottin is GOAT: [https://youtu.be/wolVJV5tNqM](https://youtu.be/wolVJV5tNqM)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2, #3, #4\n\nThen I bought the remaster of Alien. Because I love Ridley Scott, and you can have a robust discussion, but I also picked up Prometheus and Covenant too. But it was really Alien that washed away all my skepticism about how great 4K was. I've seen that movie so many times and it was astonishing the depth of new detail that was totally apparent. Ridley Scott makes the most beautiful films in history. He has the best eye in the business, I can't remember who said it. But it's hard to comprehend Ridley was making a famous bread commercial about 5 years earlier when Dan O'Bannon was meeting Giger for the production of Alejandro Jodorowsky's \"Dune\". O'Bannon only met Giger because Salvador Dali introduced Giger to Jodorowsky. That is insane. If you have not seen the documentary about the failed pre-Lynch Dune movie, do yourself a favor and watch it. \"Jodorowsky's Dune\". [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935156/reference/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935156/reference/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5\n\nAnnihilation is probably my favorite film of all time if a movie is supposed to do what a movie can possibly do, which is the marriage of all the arts: from script and narrative / subtext, to score, to cinematography, \"painting\" / blocking, directing, all technical fields and aspects, digital, etc. Other than Taxi Driver, I don't think there's ever been a more profoundly expert and impacting film about mental illness, ever. But the way he delivers the human condition's nature to self-destruct and find rebirth, while at the same time we are trying to mitigate and contemplate our struggle in real time? That was \\*amazing\\*. The way Alex Garland reimagined the Southern reach trilogy bends my mind. And loving the sausage making, this whole thing almost became an alien 3 debacle with studio interference, and Garland really stuck to his guns. The worldwide Netflix release definitely dented the sentiment about this film when it came out, but it seems time has elevated people's understanding and love for this film? Whatever the case, it's unbelievable in 4K. I went in for a cosmic horror film, and all I got was this powerfully existential experience. Lol\n\nSpeaking of alien 3, the documentary is probably one of the best ever made about how the artistic process of filmmaking can be insane and miserable: Wreckage and Rage- [https://moviesanywhere.com/movie/alien3/bonus/alien-3/extras/wreckage-and-rage-making-alien-3](https://moviesanywhere.com/movie/alien3/bonus/alien-3/extras/wreckage-and-rage-making-alien-3)\n\n\\#6\n\nI am not a hater, and I'm definitely not the kind of person that suggests my opinion about something overrides another person's joy...\n\n...so I will jokingly say that I just want someone to give Christopher Nolan a great script. I just watch some of his screenplay choices with my jaw dropped and shaking my head. I love the guy, but I'm not typically a gigantic fan of peculiar bombast over legit narrative (Inception is just so dumb). \n\nThat being said I did buy Interstellar. Dan Harmon joked that it's basically the \"astronaut in the bookcase\", but from the score overpowering the dialogue, to a bunch of other choices in the film, it's basically a big budget experimental film and it always sort of bends my mind that it exists. I do absolutely love it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just had a few seconds today to consider my upgrade, and how much I love and enjoy movies and the artform. So I thought I'd prattle out a few words on the keyboard. Howdy movie people! Yay and enjoy.",

        "text": " This might be a weird post and very exotic, but it has been bothering me for decades. I was actually almost entertaining the idea of writing Landis or his agent.\n\nA central plot episode in Trading Places centers around a circus traveling by train from one city to another while a party happens onboard. During this party, the protagonist is chased by the antagonist, and the commotion from the circus's party allows the protagonist to escape. Both comedy and suspense abound\n\nThat probably sounds kinda unique, but this is the weird part:\n\n10 years before Trading Places came out, France's comedy master Claude Zidi made a movie with Pierre Richard and Jane Birkin called [The Wild Goose Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Course_a_l'chalote) (the movie was insanely popular in France, but I am not even sure it came out in wide distribution in the Anglosphere). The plot itself is quite different from Trading Places, but the above is the **exact** same. Circus, party, criminals, etc. Some of the **FRAMES** are nearly identical to Trading Places.\n\nI've searched the internet to and fro for some sort of evidence on the internet of this supposed plagiarism, but all I could find was some Bulgarian film buff's LiveJournal written in broken French.\n\nIf anyone, on the improbable offchance you have seen both movies, has any thoughts on this, say away!

Not only is Jim Carrey giving his everything into the performance of Doctor Robotnik, but the movies do an amazing job balancing out hom being a funny nutcase and a terrifying genius.\n\nNot to mention, I feel the movies have a lot of heart in them, they are well-paced, funny, got great action, and the world-building is surprisingly competent. Actors for Sonic and Knuckles are great, and Tails needs no saying since they got the voice actress from the games. Can't go wrong with that.\n\nSo, that being said, I keep wondering about the third movie. Will Jim Carrey return to play Robotnik one more time? I sure hope so. He has said he'd consider it if he likes the script, and it would just be weird for a movie introducing Shadow to not have Robotnik in it.\n\nI also do hope Metal Sonic will appear as one final creation for Robotnik to bring down Sonic with. Maybe do it similar to Godzilla vs Kong where after fighting each other they team up to bring down a common enemy?\n\nAnd yeah, I do also hope for them to include Amy Rose, Rouge the Bat, and... Big the Cat if they can make him less annoying? Maybe also Cream and Cheese. Or, maybe that would be too crowded, I don't know. I guess I don't even know how to make all these characters plot relevant, aside from Rouge being a spy hired by Robotnik.\n\nAlso, wonder who they would cast to play Gerald Robotnik for flashbacks? I don't know why, but I would love to see Weird Al play him. Probably won't happen, but still.\n\nSo anyway, what are your guys' and gals' thoughts?",

        "text": " First movie I watched this year was a relatively obscure japanese film from 2001 directed by Akihiko Shiota, a director I haven't seen much of but that seems to have an interesting filmography.\n\n The story follows Sachiko Kita, a girl with a very difficult life: abandoned by her father and with a mother who recently attempted suicide, she starts the movie already a lost youg girl, not going to school and getting involved with a boy her age that lives as an outlaw and a homeless man, as she does not feel welcome by her classmates due to her troubled family and because of an affair she had with a school teacher when she was only twelve, a man she still keeps contact with through letters.\n\n She ends up returning to school after she notices how dangerous her life outside of it is getting, as her friend kills another boy in his appartment. It seems she's getting to turn her life around, one of the few girls who worried about her becomes her close friend, she starts participating in school activities and even starts a relationship with a boy from her class.\n\n All of this changes once her mom's boyfriend tries to assault her. After this event, the trauma really settles in, she distances herself from her friend, her relationship ends and she even starts a criminal housefire.\n\n Seeing how out of control her own life got, Sachi decides to go find the only person she feels still can understand her and give her affection: her 6th grade professor who moved from the city after the affair between them was discovered. She hitch hikes from city to city and waits for him in a local restaurant, but ends up leaving with another man that offers her \"easy money\" due to her being \"young and pretty\" before the teacher's arrival.\n\n It's a pretty sad and hopeless movie, another one that touches the problems Japan had to deal with after the 90's \"lost generation\".\n\n Social distancing, bullying, child delinquency, sexual assault on minors and many other societal issues are represented on Sachi, a girl who's traumatic family life and lack of support at school led to her getting involved with borderline illegal activities and later seeking help from a much older man who sees her as sexaully atractive, and even when she looks for him what she finds is arguably a much worse fate.\n\n Another early 200's japanise film that was worth watching, the story of a young girl who started the movie down, began to rise only to, by the end of the film, fall once again.",

        "text": "This article contains a lot of nutty film stills. For a fully illustrated version please click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/an-inadvertently-psycho-sexual-socio-political-nudie-cutie-mess-called-sextet/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/an-inadvertently-psycho-sexual-socio-political-nudie-cutie-mess-called-sextet/)\n\n*Sextet* is a stupid movie, so stupid it overlooks its own misogyny and forgets to hide it behind a veil of prurience. Nudie cuties aren’t supposed to be much of anything but a chance to see women’s mammary glands, but *Sextet* stumbles into all kinds of charged territory as it tries to find an excuse to provide the requisite imagery. \n\nBud Irwin, the director of *Sextet*, had to follow the nudie cutie rules or he would have risked getting arrested. The most important rule was to avoid sexual content. You could show a topless lady just, so long as it was “artistic” or “medical,” and not for the gratuitous thrills of what was deemed “the trench-coat crowd.”\n\nThis rule presented a challenge for the cinematic profiteers who had to actually write some kind of plot or premise to justify showing naked ladies while avoiding being openly sexual.\n\nMonsieur Irwin figured he could just grab a comedian off the Z-list circuit and film him daydreaming about 6 lovely lasses. The only trick was to think up titillating daydreams that weren’t too titillating. The result was a kind of character-driven descent into misogynist madness.\n\nI have no doubt that Buñuel would have loved this movie. I’m not kidding, it’s right up his alley. The film opens with a man named George lying with his eyes closed on the back of a boat. A disembodied narrator asks “What happened? Where am I? I’m so dizzy. It must have been that last shot. I’m on a yacht!” Right away, the time and place are mysterious and dream-like. Throughout the movie, we cross-cut between fantasy and reality without any kind of transition or explanation. We are in the kitchen, and then suddenly we are in a harem, and then we are vacuuming the living room. Time and space are completely unstable and fluid.\n\nNever mind that this is most likely due to Irwin simply ignoring film craft so he could hurry up and get to the boobs, the result is a kind of psychotic, disassociated sexual tension where lascivious desires lurk just beneath the banality of suburbia.\n\nBack to the boat. George finds himself basking in the sun on the deck when he realizes he is not alone. There are three topless women who are standing around pursing their lips, squeezing their shoulders together to accentuate certain attributes, and sticking their butts out while they smile big for the camera.\n\nInstead of dropping his pants and indulging their invitation, George puts a sailor hat on each young lady and spends the afternoon putting them to work, mopping the deck, cleaning the furniture, and bringing him drinks. Irwin couldn’t show sex, so he opted for the second best thing, domination, and subjugation. If you can’t penetrate them into submission, at least you can order them around.\n\nGeorge is played by the truly awful Pauly Dash. Mr. Dash spends the whole film enacting a horribly exaggerated imitation of Sid Caesar. Sid was far from a subtle comedian to begin with, but Dash takes all Caesar’s cross-eyed reaction shots and just runs with them. It’s painful to watch, but it’s certainly an effective way to keep the eroticism at bay. What do you do when a blonde woman with high cheekbones, a tiny waist, and generous feminine charms caresses your cheek? Why, cross your eyes and wiggle your head, of course.\n\nThen, all of a sudden, George is home with his wife, and so begins the age-old henpecked husband wheeze. Poor George is married to an unattractive, bossy woman with curlers in her hair and a frumpy housecoat. Unlike the submissive sex kittens in his fantasy world, George’s wife makes demands on him. She has him wash the dishes and wash the car, and she seems to be in a perpetual state of aggravation. \n\nWe see that George’s fantasies of dominating pretty young ladies are fueled by the subjugation he suffers in his waking life. At one point, he refers to his wife as “the warden,” and later, as she drags him somewhere, she mumbles under her breath, “come with mother.” He deals with her authority by employing an age-old male strategy. He feigns incompetence. He makes a mess of the dishes and the car until she comes and pulls him away. The result is a curious dynamic. He hides from responsibility by undermining his own agency, and she exaggerates her authority as a way of coping with this useless man. It’s no wonder he gets off ordering women around instead of having sex with them. He’s a victim of his own manipulative scheming. \n\nThe movie continues with the juxtaposition of dysfunctional married life against dysfunctional fantasy life. George passes the time being fed by maidens like a pasha in a harem, only to suddenly find he is at the breakfast table with his wife. The transitions are not like daydreams, where George appears to wake up or shake off a reverie, the film just switches back and forth without explanation. \n\nAt one point, he is in a pool with all his ladies when suddenly, he is in his living room being manhandled by his wife who exclaims, “George! You’re all wet!” And he replies, “I’ll be alright as soon as I get out of the pool.”\n\nThe pool scene is fun. It’s a cross between a Busby Berkeley. Esther Williams movie and the bathing scene in Fellini’s  *8 1/2.* It’s a grandiose oedipal fantasy where every woman is both lover and mother, oh and swimmer.\n\nAll of this is well and good, or perhaps none of it is well and good, but either way, George unexpectedly opens the door to female desire. It’s unclear why, but the women start making overtures toward little cross-eyed George. This is the one thing that is forbidden by the Hayes censorship code and so George must resist their solicitations. He suddenly becomes a beleaguered and oppressed prude beset by hungry vixens. They start taking turns carrying him away to have sex with him off-screen. George pants and stumbles as he tries to get away from the oversexed horde, but poor George is overrun.\n\nGeorge hated having to submit to his sexless wife and now he hates having to submit to his sex-starved harem. The poor guy can’t win. What George wants is power over women, but that is all. He doesn’t want to relate to them or even demand sexual satisfaction, he just wants to maintain the patriarchy. In this way, *Sextet* caters to a deeper male fantasy than just sexually accessible women. It reaffirms a dying world that men do not want to let go of. A world where men are kings and women are servants. The goal is not sexual gratification, it’s dominance.\n\nGeorge imagines himself a victim of a society where women are not only able to be powerful, but they are allowed to be sexual. These are the twin nightmares wrought by the sexual revolution. *Sextet* was made in 1964. Modern feminism was still just forming. The Pill had only just started to become available, and George saw the writing on the wall. He was ready to retreat to a world of fantasy, but even in a world of his own making, those pesky women found a way to torment him. Perhaps the core fantasy is one of being a victim. Men are not privileged, they are oppressed, and somehow society got everything wrong. We shouldn’t be liberating women, it’s men who need our sympathy and support! Ladies, give a great big hug to the next guy you see and tell him it’s gonna be alright.",

        "text": "Beyond its blatant depravity *Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom* (1975) feels like a bad omen of contemporary society. In this re-imagining of Marquis de Sade’s novel four fascists in Italy’s short-lived Republic of Salò of 1943 act out their darkest desires on helpless prisoners in a villa. The ensuing acts of among other things rape, coprophagia or torture in a roundabout way shed light on the solipsistic indifference rampant in today’s COVID-19 times.\n\n\nDirector Pier Paolo Pasolini likens his film to a crystal in the documentary *Pasolini Next to Us* (2006), and it does feel as polished and sharp as one. Cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli shoots with a precise clarity, often positioning the camera at an objectifying distance which encloses all characters within the mansion’s walls. The victims remain as anonymous as they are treated, even when they despair. What drives the four fascists never gets revealed either. When one of them (Aldo Valetti) gets on all fours during dinner hoping to get sodomized by a raping soldier, his face contorts into a devilish grin which expresses a purely mechanical pleasure. As such the film feels stripped of psychological resonance.\n\n\nFemale narrators recount their most wanton sexual experiences to excite the wicked four in a narrative framed as a descent into hell, with chapters named circles. A pianiste accompanies them with lively Chopin pieces. Thanks to such a contrast the narrator’s proclamations drip of scathing irony, foreshadowed by the jubilant music during the opening credits. The satire culminates in provocation when two young guards dance with each other at the ending to provide a sardonic counterpoint to all depravity.\n\n\nIt fits with how Pasolini turns all wickedness into banality. Near the end the fascists in turn peek at scenes of torture from a distance, as if those scenes amount to cheap entertainment. Their absolute power comes in the form of arbitrary ritual, especially exemplified when one of them gets dressed in garments reminiscent of Pasolini’s ancient Greece from *Medea* (1969). Every decision seems driven by caprice, as if they play with toys using made up rules. When they inspect the behinds of their victims, the business-like attitude of their examination in an empty room frightens.\n\n\nThroughout every moment permeates the horror of exercised power. It reduces everything to a mere object purely evaluated for its utilitarian qualities. Every act is one of consumption. All elements of *Salò* feel metaphorical, but something visceral shines through its crystalline composition. The continuous reification that takes place within the film turns political power and economic consumption into an experience. Here, reality enters through the abstract.\n\n\nAt its heart *Salò* charges a profoundly spiritual attack on modern society, where forces of commodification and technological complexity strip people of dignity. It plays like a nightmare  (while war planes ominously rush over the house in a touch of sophisticated sound design). This may be what the father of *Teorema* (1968) shouts at in horror as he runs around stark naked on the top of Mount Etna. \n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a nightmare too, even though its rupture of societal arrangements proved to be short-lived. Learning to live with the coronavirus turns out to be the vague shibboleth of contemporary times. In practice, many countries have a continuous stream of excess deaths, increasing staff shortages in essential services and increasing cases of chronic illness through long COVID. All the while they show a callous disregard for the lives of the elderly and other higher risk groups. It feels like a downward spiral not unlike that precipitated by the narrating Signoras of *Salò*.\n\n\nThat the coronavirus actually presented society with choices has been long cast to the wayside. The option exists to enact protective measures that would prevent many of the adverse effects and which would empower all to live fulfilling lives. As for instance the WHO guidelines or the Lancet COVID-19 committee recommend, vaccinations *plus* things like improving ventilation in buildings or wearing face masks in public spaces would vastly improve the situation for everyone. Instead, spearheaded by countries like the Netherlands or the United Kingdom, the world has chosen to do close to nothing.\n\n\nAlthough companies and governments have incentives to let it rip, one has to ask why populations let them – beyond those “essential workers” that are forced into unsafe situations in order to pay their bills. *Salò* enters the discussion here with its stark spiritual charges.\n\n\nKarl Polanyi warned against attempts to disembed the economy from its wider social contexts – but those attempts only ramped up, leading to the current situation around the pandemic. A general indifference to suffering now suffuses society where every interaction feels as stripped of psychology as in *Salò*. Like within that film’s mansion, other people become means towards one’s personal ends based on purely individualistic calculus. In a society perpetuated by an endless cycle of production and consumption ruled by technology, solipsism replaces solidarity. Philosopher Éric Sadin deems it the era of the I-tyrant. Within an individual’s personally imagined world, everything merely exists to further one’s own goals.\n\n\nIn such a society the simple act of wearing a face mask in a hospital becomes an insurmountable task. It shows how little value is being placed on the elderly and other more vulnerable groups, who visit that place the most and can use a COVID-19 infection the least of all. That there has been nary a memorial to commemorate the so-called end of the pandemic and those fallen during it shows the lack of care in society. In the Netherlands for instance, the public debate centers around the annoyance of protective measures. Instead of mourning, most would rather go dance like the guards at the end of the film while destruction happens in the background.\n\n\nWith the individual conceptualized as either a provider of labor power within production or a money spender within consumption, all interactions can only be seen through the lens of the exercise of power. During a pandemic, every person becomes a potential vector for spreading the disease. Yet that potential individual power and the concurrent need for societal action now gets ignored wholesale. \n\n\nUltimately however, no one will exercise power over their own lives anymore. Even the fascists in *Salò* ultimately are solely driven by capricious desires, like our society of I-tyrants cannot look beyond what is deemed normal. In the meantime more and more people will succumb to COVID-19 through death or chronic illness while the more vulnerable among us are forced to socially isolate. We toss people aside like the fascists in *Salò* tossed aside those they deemed used up.\n\n\nSocieties did face a choice to step away from this path that Pasolini satirized so forcefully in his film. To treat all with dignity. But many picked the easier option of continuous consumption unbothered by the few statistics that authorities still care to share and thereby absolving them of responsibility. The coprophagia dinners may have been about a consumptive attitude, but in these times that metaphor deserves an update. We breathe in the virus like they eat shit. Society as a whole may yearn to return to normal, but *Salò* reminds us we then run headlong for our chains. \n\n\n[Originally published on my substack.](https://sjoerdvanwijk.substack.com/p/salo-or-the-120-days-of-corona?sd=pf)",

        "text": "I watched his Pusher trilogy a long time ago so I'm not sure if this trend with him actually started with Drive (2011) but what's up with the way Nicolas Winding Refn writes his protagonists? stoic &amp; extremely capable, but at the same time robotic with minimal dialogue and/or facial expressions, monotone voice, mostly reactive instead of active, etc. if *the Driver* was an 8 on the scale of typical NWR protagonists, this kind of character trope is taken to 11 with the leads in *Only God Forgives* and *Copenhagen Cowboy*. At first I thought this was just a Ryan Gosling thing, since he has played similar characters in non NWR films like The Place Behind the Pines and Blade Runner 2049, but no, it also seems to be NWR's style as exemplified by Miu's character in the new *Copenhagen Cowboy*.\n\n\n\n\n\nwhy do you think he writes his protagonists this way? almost like they are these angels of death, floating around with no real goals of their own, constantly reacting to other characters and their problems",

        "text": "*I saw The Menu in the theater in early December and I absolutely hated it. The Menu was one of those rare movies where while watching it I was having such a bad time I starting putting together a mental list of all of the specific things I hated about it so I could explode out of the theater and rip the movie to shreds.* \n\n*Then the person I saw it with didn't really care about it and while they would have humored me, I didn't want to be that guy. The broader cultural conversation seemed to be going to same way so I just swallowed down that bile and moved on but then the movie went to streaming and now it seems to be growing into a genuine hit and critics and audiences seem to like it. So here I am, that guy, and looking to fight:*\n\nThe Menu was poorly written, mean spirited, and dumb. \n\nThe whole thing was gross and lowly manipulative, it seemed completely confused about how it wanted to audience to feel about its protagonist, and the satire of the high end restaurant industry and its broader social critique felt like ideas pulled from twenty years ago. \n\nA movie can be great as either a cutting black-hearted nasty piece of work, or as dumb feel-good spectacle but when it's broad nihilism that imagines itself fun its just the worst. The glee The Menu takes in showing the audience things like that Sous Chef shooting himself in the face or the old guy getting his finger cut off was gross. You want to be a fucked up horror movie that shows me things like that to revolt me that's fine but the way it wants the audience to revel in the nastiness, which isn't comedy violence, sucks. \n\nAnd the writing is so bad its all completely unearned. The writers want to show us a guy shoot himself in the face so in the course of just one scene they have a character walk into the movie, have a different character introduce him to the audience with a sad story, have him kill himself, and then have his body dragged off screen to make no further impact on the film. They want to mutilate the old man but he doesn't really deserve something that extreme, so they tack on a backstory where he's an incestuous pedophile, but that doesn't have anything to do with why he's being punished. \n\nThe whole movie is a tonal mess that feels like multiple passes on the script mushed together. Scenes keep building to the characters completely freaking out until the next one starts and everyone just sort of abruptly resets back to sitting around their tables waiting for the next course. The protagonist is a all over the place; half the time she's sardonic and brassy, half the time she's weeping. She's a sex worker but also the movie doesn't really want to touch that idea. At the end when she engineers her escape she hesitates to abandon everyone but the old woman kindly giver her permission to save herself and she goes, then she gets on the boat and the last thing we see is her chowing down on a hamburger, triumphantly celebrating all of those same people being burned alive. \n\nAnd on top of the sloppy plotting and scene work the bigger ideas were stupid. It is satirizing a dumb person's idea of what fine dining was fifteen, twenty years ago. The idea that high end food is just pretentious people pretending to enjoy gels and powders is beyond hacky and played out. That is a critique you could have gotten from a later season episode of a procedural crime show in 2011 where someone is murdered with liquid nitrogen. And the idea that way to escape the restaurant is to reject fine food in favor of a hamburger because all the chef really wants to do is be a short order fry-cook again is just the goofy speech Denis Leary gave at the end of Demolition Man in 1993 meeting Kevin Spacey's character from American Beauty in 1999. \n\nUnderneath that dumbness is a ugly anti-art, anti-intellectualism, faux populism. The thing about actual fine dining, at least in my extremely fleeting experience, is that the food is really, really, good and satisfying. Cooking like that is a high art. The crime in contemporary fine dining isn't that its secretly bad, hollow, and pretentious; its that, unlike other arts like painting or film or music, access to high level food is completely walled off for everyone but the rich.The Menu does occasionally try to satirize that but in the end it tells the audience that actually the best food possible is the sloppy cheeseburger they already know, made with love. That is condescending bullshit.\n\n*Ok, my rant is over. I'd love for someone to come in and dissect my ideas and tell me why actually I'm the idiot who totally missed what was going on.*",
