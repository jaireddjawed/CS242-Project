        "text": "As a learning exercise, I want to implement simple calendar with *recurring events*.\n\nI'm struggling to find some papers, articles or examples what is best way to do it. So far I identified following approaches:\n\n1. Create `abstractRecurringEvent` that is not shown on calendar. Some background job reads all `abstractRecurringEvents` and creates `normalEvents` based on `abstractRecurringEvent` for next X years.\n\nPros:\nRelatively easy to implement.\n\nCons:\nBackground job being error prone (must keep everything perfectly in sync).\nWhen `abstractRecurruingEvent` is deleted or modified, it has to update or modify all `normalEvents` that originated from the `abstractRecurringEvent` (this might update or delete hundreds of records).\n\n2. Each \"day\" when renders itself checks all \"abstractRecurringEvents\" if the \"day\" matches `abstractRecurringEvents` recurrence rule. If yes, then adds an event.\n\nPros:\nDoesn't require background process that creates events for next X years \n\nCons:\nIn case of many `abstractRecurringEvents`, each new day might be tested against dozens of it, thus potentially slow.\n\n*Questions:*\nI don't want to do huge architecture mistake. What is best approach to solve this programming problem?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "I am currently a mechanical engineer in an R&amp;D Prototyping role. Over the last few years I have developed increasingly bad back pain to the point where I am now considering permanent disability. I am not able to sit at a desk, stand, or work over a table for more than an hour without taking long rest breaks laying on my back, but when I am laying down I can work on a laptop with my head propped up. I am also a veteran and have access to the VA vocational rehabilitation program and I am considering making a proposal to retrain in cs. If I can do 100% remote work I think I would be able to be productive in a programming role.\n\nDoes this sound like an achievable goal? Are there opportunities out there that would be accommodating in this way, especially in a junior role?\n\nOther pertinent information:\n\nMy back pain is not acute, but it builds up slowly over time. I can force myself to sit, stand or do other work for much longer periods but I will pay for it in pain as it builds up. This is unsustainable for my family as I come home in a lot of pain and a very bad mood after working a full day, and of course my ability to concentrate on my task diminishes as the pain increases. This means I could still occasionally grit and bear it for in person meetings or interviewing, but is not something I can do on a daily basis.\n\nI don't have a ton of software experience so far but I did take a lower division course in C++ (that I did so well in the professor asked if I would tutor/ta for the next semester), and I had an upper level engineering dynamics course that was extremely heavy in Matlab programming for the lab portion. I also have math courses through to differential equations and linear algebra (but no discrete math).\n\nI have a good enough GPA to apply to grad school and may be able to get a masters degree paid for by vocational rehabilitation, or alternatively I could also do a boot camp. I don't know enough about cs career fields yet to know what I would really enjoy working on but the type of problem solving and programming I have done would probably be more aligned with back end work. I think the career path might more be driven by what types of jobs would accommodate me, how saturated and needed those jobs are, and if there is a considerable difference in pay in some paths. \n\nI did go through the faq and wiki and found some great information in there on switching careers, but I figure the disability part of my situation makes this unique enough to write a new post. \n\nWhat would you do in my situation? \n\nThanks for any insights and suggestions you may have!",

        "text": "I've been doing this for over ten years, and I have switched platforms a number of times.  Early in my career I spent a lot of time in Perl and Python, mid career I was doing almost exclusively JS and web front end with a variety of frameworks, recently I have been doing almost exclusively Android in Kotlin.\n\nMy question is:  It's tempting to list everything on Linkedin's skills section or on a resume.  However if I had to really do a coding exercise where the code had to compile, I'd definitely feel 100% more comfortable in Kotlin right now.  I could probably get through in JS or Python, but I'd be screwed if I had to write real Perl code.",

It knew I was abroad still somehow even though I was using a VPN to my home country.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea on how to get round this and have a full fixed UK router abroad so it is the same as logging in from home?\n\nI know this must exist but I don't know how to find or solve this. I imagine there is a way to use my home Internet provider somehow abroad but have no idea on how to get it so it appears I am still at home when I sign in to work.\n\nAny help would be massively appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance",

Recently I have been moved to a project where I am the sole Java Engineer and my first task has been to take an application that a whole other team of engineers built that only runs in the cloud run locally. It has taken some time but I got everything except one part working, but we had a meeting today and it seems that there is more missing that I was unaware of and that large amounts of the application need large changes. Throughout this entire ticket I have been extremely anxious not knowing if what I am doing is correct, and being afraid that at some point the client will see that I am not super knowledgeable about all of the technologies being used. I don't want to let my team down, but I am a bit discouraged. Does anyone relate to these feelings of discouragement and high anxiety in the Software Engineering community?",

The minor is only recognized on the bachelor's transcript and I will not receive any certificate or diploma if I chose to go the minor route. Would an entire degree in cs (associates) be more marketable to employers than just having the minor or does the minor look better since its earned at a 4 year institution?\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thank you in advance!",

Should we do something about it.\n\n## Quick Backstory\n\nI went to a really cool, project-driven, eye-on-industry standards type of school. I did really well and I am comfortable with the knowledge and lack thereof.\n\nI am in my first job at a small company as a junior software engineer.  We're an OEM so we're quite heavily software based.\n\n## The problem\n\nAnother junior and I started working there at the same time as junior software developers. We were met with our manager: the right-hand person of the CEO/almost graduating electronic engineer/embedded programmer, self-taught 'software engineer'. This person has been working at the company for 5 years already.\n\nMy fellow junior and I started noticing some really rotten things about the code base and management. It's been months of after-work deliberating on why the company is so awful to work at, and we've even been making some progress in how we think we can help the company and fix its blatant problems.\n\n## Holy Vindication\n\nLast night I read this: [How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert Beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/). It is as if the heavens aligned just to bestow this golden article on me. Every word of this describes our team's predicament and the cause of our anguish.\n\n## The point\n\nMy fellow junior and I are leaving the company soon (textbook [dead sea effect](https://medium.com/geekculture/the-dead-sea-effect-d71df13724f8)). But armed with the knowledge of why the company is doing so perpetually mediocre, I have a couple of options:\n\n- Wait until I have my next job confirmed, ready to put in my leave, then casually just drop the article in their inbox, and wait for all hell to break loose, sticking it to the man.\n- Casually just drop the article in their inbox, and wait for all hell to break loose, sticking it to the man.\n- With this knowledge and a bit of advice from you guys, see if I can't help them a bit with this problem that is just going unnoticed.\n- Maby pass the article on to the CEO in the hopes that they see that we have a problem, and that we are suffering under our management.\n\n## Unnecessary Final Note\n\nIt's been a rough year in this company, and this article has just been such a perfectly sobering description of why. It would just be nice for once to say: \"See, I do know what I'm talking about. We should have unit tests. You're just an expert beginner that is absolutely suffocating this company with your ego, therefore you can't even have a rational conversation about how our code is actually bad.\" (We have this one file with just 23,000 lines in it)\n\nIt's unprofessional, and I won't do it. But it is just nice to think about for a while.",

I hope I can find an answer here, or at least an explanation for why my question is opinionated or doesn't make sense. \n\nMany representations of the V-model, such as the one above, show three  steps of design: system design, architecture design, and module design.  The distinction between module and architecture design seems to be  pretty straightforward: Module design is concerned with individual  components whilst architecture design is concerned with how these  compontents fit together. However, the difference between system and  architecture design is one that I failed to grasp. When I tried  searching about the distinction on the web, most of the sources I found  were trying to explain the difference between design and architecture,  or software design and software architecture, but not system design and  system architecture. The wikipedia article about the V-model says that [Systems design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design) is the phase where system engineers analyze and understand the business of the proposed system, but I don't see  how can understanding or analyzing be considered \"design\".",

I tend to sit right in the middle of the engineering, research, and UX design teams and help keep everyone focused on the things that matter.\n\nSo in my personal time, I've now developed a considerable backlog of product Proof-of-concept ideas which make use of this new class of AI tools in various ways in a wide range of sectors.

        "text": "Yesterday I installed  Windows95 on a virtual machine. Having IE3.0 not much works on the web  except google and my website :D, so communication in general seemed  problematic. So I gave Nightfox a chance, it's a peer to peer cli  program for text comm and file transfer inside a LAN or direct IP which  works on linux and windows. I wrote it in C  one or two years ago. The  windows version was compiled on a Windows 10, as a 32bit executable so i  figured I could try and run it on windows 95 :D.    \nGuess what?! It worked!  \nAn  almost 30 year old OS ran communication software written for Windows  10. I'm not a windows fan, I actually hate everything windows spit out  from Windows 10 onwards, but I have to admit compiling a program on a  todays OS and have it run without any change or any major issues on Windows95 is quite impressive. Well.. I'm actually impressed by Windows 95, not the  modern OS anyway :)))\n\n[https://www.green-byte.net/nightfox/](https://www.green-byte.net/nightfox/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing video rghe4pyxlnaa1...*",

In the first chapter, I read the following sentence:\n\n&gt;Data analysis organizations estimate that the global maintenance backlogs for information technology software amount to $1 trillion of technical debt.\n\nDoes anyone know how they came up with that $1 trillion number? Is there a public study where I can read how these \"data analysis organizations\" quantified and measured technical debt? It's not that I'm dubious (I am a little though) but I would like to see how researchers are quantifying tech debt in organizations.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hi there! Consider the following problem: there is a team A that needs to implement a method. This method is already implemented by a team B in another package X. Maybe you think that the most obvious solution is to import X into the project, so they reduce duplicated code in the projects codebase (don't repeat yourself!). But Team A is skeptical to do this because there is a trust problem in Team B: if the package X brakes in the future and the projects gets down because of it, it is possible that Team A gets penalized. In summary, Team A doesn't want to depend on the Team B's ability of avoiding future problems or solve a incoming one. The more time Team A gets blocked, more money is lost by the company and, since it's a Team A's project, they will be responsibilized. So, Team A is considering to just copy the method from X package and paste it into where it is needed.   \n\n\nWhat would you do in this situation?",
