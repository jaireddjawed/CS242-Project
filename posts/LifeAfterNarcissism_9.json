        "text": "I'm 21. I moved out from NMom's house about 6 months ago and went to live with my dad and step mom. My situation at home with NMom used to be unbearable, and it had never even occurred to me that I could go live with my dad until he suggested it. One day, after a violent one-sided argument (basically my mom just hurling insults at me for no reason) I left. \n\nIt's now been about 6 months. I've finished my degree, attend therapy weekly, have a great relationship with my dad and step-mom, and just started a new part-time job. But once in a while, like today, I'll get a super long email from my mom. Explaining to me what a horrible and pathetic child I am, and how I'm living my life all wrong. And it hurts me so much. It just completely destroys me and it's making me think that I'm not moving forward, or not healing fast enough and I just don't know what to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm asking for guidance from you guys: does it ever get any better? how do you deal with hard days? how do you keep going when most of your extended family believes all the lies your NParent spreads about you? I just feel like crawling up into a ball and hiding from the rest of the world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in a lot of pain because I have no friends to talk to as well. My NMom made me cut contact with almost all of them gradually, and I just feel so alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice or comment is appreciated. Please be kind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I am a single parent, and my fleas are getting rough - he's a wonderful, sweet, loving boy, but he is also very challenging and my temper is just snapping right and left.  Sometimes I hear how I talk to him when he's acting up, and I just hate myself.  \n\nI feel like I really failed as a parent today... he acted up pretty severely at school, and I blew up at him when we got home.  But we both need coping strategies.  \n\nI'm trying, I really am, and we have a great time most of the time.  We do activities, have conversations, play, I love teaching him about stuff and he loves learning about it.  But I just DON'T have a proper example in my head of how to handle issues.  I don't know when letting something go is permissive and enabling, or when being a stern disciplinarian is too much (I tend to go towards the 'stern' end of the spectrum).  \n\nAnyway.  I'm just ranting now, and trying to explain everything because my shitty *parents* never listened to me (I keep writing mother and deleting it because I need to give my late father some credit for ignoring my frequent complaints about her.  How he could possibly have allowed us to stay in that woman's custody is so beyond my conception).  \n\nI've gone to a few therapists, and tried a number of SSRIs.  I absolutely have depression, but, over the years, I've gone through so many medications and had bad effects, and I'm scared of past experiences with side effects repeating myself.  It's just my son and I, and I'm afraid that I'll lose my shit.\n\nThis leads me to the need of a good psychiatrist or someone connected to one, like a therapist who can help me get prescriptions with a consultation or something.  But I've had so many shitty therapists, too!  Ones that don't know what to do with me, ones that don't understand what my toxic mother really was, ones that get that part but can't really conceive of what she really did to my brain, ones that have thought my issues all stemmed from my loneliness as a single parent (which is a major side effect IMO, but not the root), and - the one that I went to the longest - one who just let me vent and cry and vent and cry for at least ten visits without really advising me about anything, until my insurance suddenly changed and boom game over.  \n\n**TL;DR: I don't have a lot of money, but I very much need and want mental help to try and work through some of the abuse I dealt with at the hands of my mother, and I think my own son could use it as well.  How do I find someone that knows what the hell they're doing?**\n\nThanks for reading.  Today was a rough day, and I feel like I'm falling apart.",

        "text": "Today I had lunch with my Nmom after going NC for about 2.5 years. Prior to meeting her, I noticed I did not have my usual symptoms of anxiety like having short breath, migraines, or ruminating dark thoughts. I was calm, collected, and totally aware of who I was. I had grown up considerably since going NC. I did not dismiss my feelings, thoughts, or memories of what happened in my dark past with my Nfamily - I did everything in my abilities to validate it. I found my own happiness, my own identity, and my own sense of forgiveness to myself. I made peace with the fact that I cannot change other people, even those who have wronged me, I can only change my pain by completely acknowledging it and then letting it go. \n\nWe met up because last April she had a heart attack, an aortic dissection... The doctor said she is lucky to be alive. I called her a few times to make sure she was okay and I noted that she was heavily medicated and seemed quite lethargic and calm. Meeting up with her today, I was surprised how much I had grown up and none of my defenses or offenses were triggered. She had changed. She was too close to death, even now she still is. I didn't say anything when she said she remembers how she was a long time ago, and thinks how stupid she was. I didn't say anything when she said, sometimes she feels like she's drowning in regret. I merely looked at her as a woman in her sixties, close to death, and never had she looked more alive, more real, and more of a true person. \n\nOur lunch was pretty good. Coffee was good too. We both like coffee a lot. We chatted about coffee and food and other things. \n\nI am not in the position to judge my nfamily anymore, because by judging them I am trying to find retribution for something that doesn't exist anymore. It doesn't exist in ME anymore. I moved on, I moved forward in my life. I don't try to find justice or liberty from people who don't have even know what that means for themselves anymore. \n\nI am fully aware of what is right and what is wrong. I am conscientious in my behavior towards others regardless of who they are. I accepted myself as I am even if I don't know what that means in the moment. I accepted my mother for who she is: for her pain, her insanity, her darkness, her love, her beauty, her rage, her truth. I accepted it all because by doing so I accepted myself - and a part of my childhood as it is, not how I wished it to be. \n\nThere is no greater sense of empowerment than realizing the only person who gives away your power, your truth, your identity is you and nobody else. It is time to love yourself and move forward.\n\nUpdate: \nIf the above content offends you maybe you’re not ready to move on and I’m sorry that you’re  still in place of suffering. From one survivor to another don’t let the pain in the past define who you are till you end up becoming a Narcissist yourself.",

Having a fulfilling life - (is there a more concise word for this?). Most manifests from working a job that was mediocre-to-bad. It felt like i was wasting my life there for no reason. (I don't value money that much. I value it for rent and groceries tho. Minimal material attachments, bc thats how i coped with Nrents taking away everything at many points. Material attachment never came back.) Unemployed atm due to the health concerns up there ^.\n\n3. Being around nice or at minimum neutral ppl - (is there a more concise word for this?) Mostly due to my old work place having a few aggro managers. Many of my fellow employees and other managers were neutral towards me, but it never managed to offset the unfulfilling work (2.) and aggro managers. \n\nOtherwise socially - i used to value friendship much more.

The whole point of this is trigger you to chase after them and apologize and make things right again between you.\n\nThe reason you have likely been identified as good supply for a N is bc you have this exact knee jerk response when they are acting butthurt and upset and sullen and giving you the silent treatment or instilling fear in you that you are about to be abandoned... *you will want to rush to them and make things better and take the blame*. Someone who doesn't have this knee jerk response to chase after them and smooth things over and apologize, is of no use to a N.\n\nIf you confront a N about their behavior, no matter how kindly and respectfully you approach them, and no matter how legitimate your complaint, they will never leave you with a feeling of being *heard* and *understood*. You will never feel like the problem has been *resolved*. Instead there will be drama, usually in the form of the N flipping the script so that they become the victim and you become the wrongdoer who has to defend yourself. They can do this in a passive aggressive way by ignoring you and administering the silent treatment, or in an overtly aggressive way by lobbing accusations at you so that you are on the defense.\n\nA good way to flush out a N, is to approach that person with some complaint you have about their behavior. Tell them how its effected you, and say you just want to resolve things. Watch carefully what happens.",

        "text": "It has been a wearying week! I'm going to bullet-point it:\n\n* **Weds 29th** \\- my youngest sister, an unfortunate 16-year-old FM, teamed up with my NMum to dump a bunch of unwanted books on my doorstep (the family is trying to sell their house). She also pushed a print-out of the latest of NMum's toxic emails through the letterbox. This was done in the manner of a prank - looking down at them from my bedroom window, I could see my sister smirking from her passenger seat, unaware she was being watched. After they got bored and drove off, I put most of the books on eBay and gave the rest to charity.\n* **Sat 1st** \\- after my shift at work, I came home around 6PM to find the same car parked in front of our drive and my EDad having a conversation with my Partner. I asked \"What is this?\", to which he replied \"I've brought the last of the things from the house now that we've sold it\", to which I replied \"Oh\", walked past him into the house, and shut the door. The books, again, went on eBay or to the charity shop. My Partner's one regret is that she didn't fully articulate how culpable EDad has been in my abuse - she has since taken to writing a list of what they've done to me.\n* **Mon 3rd** \\- I spectacularly failed to take a driving test, having mistaken the right test time and misplaced the certificate I needed at entry. I blamed this largely on the horrible coping mechanisms my Parents have left me, that which makes me approach a situation as though it'll all just be 'alright' if I don't think about it. \n* **Tues 4th** \\- not much happened, except that my partner checked online and found the sale of the house had not gone through. Apparently they were gambling that, even if the sale didn't work out, they could at least hoover me back in.\n* **Weds 5th** \\- I received an email from my NAunt. This is the first communication from her since 2014, when she yelled at me because I wouldn't give her control over my life and my NMum, her younger sister, decided we as a family should go NC. There is a long history between them, of my NAunt abusing my NMum, which probably exacerbated NMum's nature. This email, worded the way a scam artist would, invites me to my grandmother's 80th this weekend to discuss dubious business opportunities - and bring my partner. That she's stalked us enough to know I have a partner creeps me out in the extreme.\n\nNaturally, even if I could afford it, I would not visit my grandmother for her 80th. I am not sure if NAunt is taking advantage of my going NC on NMum or if they're working together. Either way, at this point I am thoroughly tired of the whole pack of them, and of being either Scapegoat or Golden Child, and of my mind being this pummeled and fractured. Some might be tempted to see NAunt as an ally against my family, but, well...see the title to this post. \n\nNo Narc Is Trustworthy. Leave them alone and let them eat one another.",

It’s happened twice so far, and each time I get afraid and avoid the person for a bit, and when I bring it up it hasn’t even been a big deal. Which is a relief, but it still causes a lot of emotional stress. \n\nGoing along with this, I also think that people’s moods will turn really fast if I do something “weird”/“wrong”. I wait for this reaction, for them to just suddenly not like me anymore. When this happened with someone I had just met and bonded with, and they didn’t stop liking me, I was kind of astonished. \n\nHas this ever happened to any of you? Has it stopped over time?\n\nMost importantly, is this what it’s like to be free from narcs? ",

        "text": "Hey yall! This is a little complex, but I'll try to be succinct. \n\nAbout 1 year ago I \"diagnosed\" the biggest problem in my life and relationships--my NMom taught me some really unhealthy stuff about boundaries, so basically 90% of the relationships in my life were trash. \n\nI feel like I've done a decent job putting myself back together after purging the Nrelationships from my life. The friends that are still here are superheroes to me, and I'm so grateful that my boyfriend and I have managed to stick together through this intense period of transformation and growth. \n\nI recently got close with a new friend. We have plenty in common, and objectively I think she's great. \n\nBut that being said, she's not one of those people that I just immediately click with. I like her a lot, but we have very different tastes in music, visual aesthetics, even things we enjoy doing. \n\nI might be projecting a little, now that I have this new lease on life, post-narc purge. But I feel like I see signs in her behavior that she's struggling with some of the same issues I had before I identified the problem... like she's about 2 steps into a journey that I'm already 300 steps down. To be fair, I'm seeing this all over the place now (so I seriously might just be projecting on everyone, haha)\n\nIt's clear she's struggling, and she's still pretty guarded about some stuff. I feel for her, and I really want to be a supportive friend, especially because I went through some really low periods in this journey, and felt totally hung out to dry by all the narc \"friends\" and family I had. I see a little bit of myself in her, and I feel bad for her just like I do for my former self. \n\nBut I cannot be her surrogate mother. Or her attached-at-the-hip best friend. And I'm starting to feel like I need to develop a strategy for enforcing boundaries with her, or I'm going to end up accidentally hurting her feelings. I've gotten better at enforcing boundaries in general, but not with someone I identify SO strongly with... does that make sense? \n\nI don't want to lose her friendship. But she hits me up to talk or hang out WAY more frequently than I am available. I am an introvert, and it's starting to feel annoying, even though I don't find her annoying as a person. It's also draining because I still have enough of my own healing to get through, and it is still my instinct to take care of other people's needs before my own.\n\nObjectively, I am much busier than her. I run my own business and also have very time consuming solitary hobbies (writing, yoga, reading), while she's working part-time--I just don't have as much free time. I also know that I have interests she doesn't share, and some friendship needs she can't meet. For instance, I'm in an LTR, I'd love to have a girlfriend I can talk to about relationship issues. I occasionally enjoy drinking wine and bitching about my day. I like going out to dinner. Smoking a J and playing video games. \n\nThese are all things she can't/wouldn't want to do, for one reason or other, and that's totally fine... but I feel like I should be looking for friends who like to do the same things I do. I can't fill up every minute of my free time with her, catering to her needs. If I do, I nix my chances at meeting other great people that I have more in common with, people who already have healthy boundaries. \n\nIt's just weird, because I feel like I WAS her in a platonic relationship I had previously... and the amount of suffering I endured because my ex-friend couldn't enforce boundaries was like psychological torture. It was this push-pull, come-hither-no-wait-leave-me-alone dance that went on for ages and literally tied my brain in knots, I really wish she had just been honest with me. But I'm sure not everyone appreciates/craves honesty as much as I do, and I really don't want to cause any unnecessary hurt here. \n\n**TL;DR**: New friend hasn't seen the light yet, doesn't understand healthy boundaries. I see a lot of myself in her, so I don't want to hang her out to dry, but I need my space. How do I enforce boundaries without withdrawing my support or screwing up the friendship? ",

Wow, so this is how it works like. How did the interesting talk orginated? How does it works like? Is there a formula to create it? Don't misunderstand me for a freak though, please. Sometimes I've been a part of this dialogue, and when I can fit in it and enjoy it, I am really happy. I'm looking for more of this, at the moment online.

What happened between us is one of the most painful things to have ever happened to me. Some days, I still sit in the shock of it all. The disturbing truth of who you turned out to be was something that literally made me physically ill and something that is still so hard for me to comprehend.\n\nThe day I realized that I will never hear a true apology from you, I gained valuable knowledge and the ability to find closure within myself and not you. I will not spend the rest of my life waiting for that apology. I refuse to give another piece of my life to you. What is helpful to me is knowing and accepting that you are just one of those people, and I am not.\n\nOne of those people who hurts others deeply, and is so ashamed by your own actions, you can never truly own up to them. Because to do so would be an attack against your ego, your self-esteem, and your self-worth the way YOU see it and feel it. To do so, would mean more self-loathing for you and more demons within to fight. Admitting you were wrong is an attack against yourself, and you already so fragile and weak. You are already to the point of trying to destroy other people like you have destroyed yourself.\n\nI will not demand an apology from you any longer, or that you fix the situation. I won't confront you with your despicable actions any longer. I already know you will have a painful life with the path you are headed on. I won't seek to hurt you back. Karma is real, but it's not my job to see that it gets served. It's not my job to force apologies out of you, to force you to do your own internal work that needs to be done.\n\nI will never be the person who gets you to see your mistakes and make changes. The only person who could ever do that is you.\n\nThank you for the 5 years of friendship. 5 years of hard lessons and painful truth. It's over now, and in letting go of the apology that will never happen, I have regained my life.\n\nA life spent waiting in that dark place for your apology is a life wasted away.\n\nGoodbye.",

It was either my life or his life, we could not both survive in the same home. Since then, he has cried all his pain and anger out on me by phone, in mails or waiting for me in the neighborhood when I came from work. Why would I divorce him? Because he has not had a job for five years, I have cared for him. He has never helped with the home or the children. He's always too tired, too sick or it's his bad childhood that hurts him. He became furious if the bus drove from him or I heard some music he did not like etc. I would not be kicked off, humiliated, sexually abused, or beaten in all aspects of life anymore. I asked him to stand beside me like a man, not lay like a whining child on the floor. Be my husband, not my child. We have four big and amazing children together, all of whom are either angry or afraid of him. I should have wondered about all his regrets, all his reproaches and all his bitterness. But he convinced me that all that could satisfy him was me, and only me. I was so young and naive. Now I'm sad and tired, poor and full of bad conscience. I just want to have some peace and quiet in my life. That's why I asked for divorce, and now I almost regret it. My life has become so full of turmoil and trouble. The fact that he lived with a new woman already 20 days after our divorce did not change anything in his anger. It is still very hard for him. He is the victim, why?",

        "text": "My mother was a victim of incest. What is it about people who have been sexually abused, that this keeps reoccurring in their lives? It was like every pervert in the county kept trying to assault my mom. \n\n\nThere is this part in my favorite book, The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts by Maxine Hong Kingston, where her mom is telling a recent immigrant to San Francisco: \"On your weak days, do not walk through this part of the city, you will be acosted by hobo ghosts and wino ghosts. On your strong days you can walk through and no one will bother you.\" \n\nI believe after my mom was sexually abused as a young girl, she was walking around with some sort of \"abuse me\" signal that all those who would exploit that could see. \n\nShe told me many stories, a man chasing her home from school, a man that stuck his hands down her pants in a grocery store, a man that tried to attack her when she walked back to her car when she had her first job.\n\nWhen I was about 3 years old, my mom, me and my baby sister were walking to the park, well, my baby sister was in the stroller and I was walking. When we got near the park, a man quickly approached us and tried to grab my mother. I believe he was trying to carry her off and she wouldn't let go of the baby carriage. I started screaming. The baby carriage was either knocked over or almost knocked over, I can't remember which. I think the man was telling me to shut up, but I can't be sure if that's true. I remember the terror that I felt. \n\nI don't remember how we got out of that situation but we went into a nearby house and my mother was using their phone. The little girl that lived at this house took me into her room to play while I am sure the woman that lived there was trying to calm my mother. I remember wanting to go to her very badly, and I was very worried about her. \n\nRecently I have been thinking about this incident a lot. What a sad thing, to have that invisible target on your head. Why does that happen? Is it a broken spirit that evil people can sense? \n\nOf course my mom raised me to be suspicious of all men, and she made me hyperaware of anyone that could be attacking at any moment. \n\nI wonder why I chose to be her daughter before I was born, as I am a believer that we choose our paths in order to progress on our soul's journey.\n\nMy mother being so damaged is what made me want to take care of her for so long. She has actually been my child. But why is it that we are here to parent in the form of a child? Is it to teach us greater compassion, and then to teach us how to prize compassion for ourselves? \n\nWithout compassion for yourself, you will not progress beyond the role of caretaker for your sick parent. \n\nAnd who told me it was my job to take care of her? The worry of a little child, watching her mother oozing out blood, trying to bandage a wound. The very first phrase I ever said was \"It won't be so bad,\" which was always said to my mom to convince her to calm down (to stop thinking up \"doomsday scenarios,\" which is how I have come to think of anxiety.) \n\nI don't know how to balance my own life. I can't try to balance hers anymore. I can't stick up for her, and protect her, and chase after her, trying to convince her that she is loved and lovable. \n\nI have become a massage therapist to show love and care to a thousand people who are stressed, injured, lost and sick. And I am also frequently healed by being a healer. \n\nI can fix people who *want* to be fixed. And the hyperawareness that I was given has made me so intuitive that I can often tell the emotional root-causes of habits of posture. \n\nI thought I was here to teach my mother how to heal. Instead she has been the teacher. \n\nTeachers can be the worst people in our lives. Some times they teach us about the lengths and depths that we will go to in order to maintain the status quo, especially when the status quo is a completely negative view of the self. \n\n\"I'm garbage, I deserve this.\" \n\"I might as well stay because it never gets any better.\" \n\"I need them more than I need to grow up and become an adult.\" \n\nLately I have been thinking a lot about transgenerational suffering. Suffering that is passed down through the generations.\n\nI believe in my family there was a spike in madness due to the men fighting in WWI and WWII. My great grandpa who was in WWI never really recovered, was in and out of mental institutions and my great grandma, his wife killed herself right when he was being released to come home again. Her son, my grandpa, my dad's father, found her. My grandpa had fought in WWII and beat his wife, my grandma, a few times after the war. My dad and my aunt were very affected by this and none of the adults in their life talked about it. My parents started blurting this stuff out to us when they were in their mid 30s, usually in emotionally heated moments. \n\nWhen things like that are blurted, time seems to slow down. The information that your great grandmother hung herself, and the tortured way your dad speaks about it, are like a bomb landing in your mind. \n\nMy mom's sudden admission that she was molested landed like a bomb in my mind. \n\nTrauma is like a bomb exploding in your mind. Sometimes this bomb makes us not remember what came next, or gives us the distinct impression that we are floating outside of ourselves. \n\nShamans would retrieve this part of you, this part of your soul that is floating outside of your body. With great care, with music, with incense, with singing, your soul would gently be brought back to be incorporated with the rest of you, giving you wholeness. \n\nYou can also do these things for yourself. At the hard work at the end of the road, when you have gone No Contact no matter how much it hurts, you will be able to see these things clearly. \n\nI began to see how much overfeeling I do. I am a highly sensitive person, a wonderful label for people who understand why and how they got that way. (Labels themselves can be a thing that we cling to when we are still struggling to find out \"What's wrong with me?\" AKA \"How come I can't seem to thrive?\" \"How come I can't look people in the eyes?\" \"How come I am scared of everyone that I meet?\") \n\nWe are living in exciting times. We have a forum to discuss all of these things. We do not have to grow up surrounded by people who think if you don't talk about a suicide, you're solving the problem. \n\nEverything that our parents and our grandparents do not resolve falls onto the shoulders, into the bellies of, onto the nervous systems of the great grandchildren. \n\nPrecious, precious children that we all once were. Do you feel called? What is your soul crying out for? \n\nLove. ",

        "text": "(Edited for typos and also to say I have no idea how that spoiler tag got there or how to remove it . . .) - I'm not a youngster anymore (late 40s!). I've been getting by pretty well, but in the last year my issues with attachment and abandonment have caused some significant pain.\n\nI like and get along with most people I meet, but there aren't many I deeply feel the urge to friend. When I do it's almost always other people who have their own traumatic histories but have done a lot of healing. However, I still struggle with a desire to have only really super close friendships with the people I'm really drawn to. I recognise this is not what everyone else wants and I completely contain any big feelings I have for new people and pretend like I am just in normal getting to know you phase so as not to freak them out. Sometimes I feel like I'm falling in love with a new female friend. I have a long term male partner and we have a very happy and stable relationship. I do wonder if these powerful feelings for new female friends are related to not having really been mothered properly. Not that I am looking for friends to mother me. It's not that at all. I just wonder if it's more about the level of intimacy that's been missed by not having had a deeply connected and available mother figure. Does this resonate with anyone? If so, how do you make sense of it?\n\nAlso I invariably feel abandoned by what (for some other people) seems to be the normal ebb and flow of a friendship. For example, a friend I had been seeing every three weeks or so. We have been away together with our families a few times. She suddenly found another new friend and then it became weeks and months since we'd caught up even though we were still in touch. I felt so deeply abandoned I could hardly stop myself from crying when I was eventually back at a choir we both belong to. I am heartily sick of all this and ready to sort it out so have found a new therapist. Now I can't stop thinking about her either. I just find her name popping into my mind dozens and dozens of times during the day. What even is this?! I hope some of you can relate a bit.",

        "text": "Hi everyone I’m new to the subreddit and on mobile so apologies for formatting.\n\nTl:dr at the bottom\n\nA little back story so my current issue makes sense. I’m currently a 27 year old female. I was with my ex for five years met at 18 broke up at 23, with having our son on the last year. My ex was emotionally and most probably finically abusive. I was constantly gaslit and ignored for expressing my feelings, any money I had was spent on him and his needs. While pregnant and only one working coming home after 8h shifts ( aged care worker) I would have to come home do the dishes and make food. \nThere was also a constant threat of fake violence, I’d hear multiple times how much he used to fight and how many guys he supposedly beat up in the bathrooms of the clubs we were at (but I never saw any evidence). \n\nNow with the background done onto my current issue. He has our son every second weekend and is constantly late picking him up because he was asleep (he does do nightshift) but never on the weekends he has our son. He also has him 2 nights a week for dinner (I realise this is better than most split couples get). He has been missing those because again he has been asleep. I’m currently in a relationship with a wonderful man who doesn’t treat me like the maid. \n\nNow last time my son was due to be picked up on the weekend I had an event planned so wonderful partner offered to look after my son until his dad picked him up. He was an hour late picking him up and my partner had enough and once my ex did show he up he said he needed to leave straight away because he had to get to work (I would gather in a frustrated tone, I don’t know I wasn’t there). \nEverything went smoothly until during this weeks dinner drop off (partner was at his house). Ex says he is upset at partner and that partner had a complete go at him and he had to stop himself from pushing my partner down the top of the stairs to get into his place (steep stairs, probably 20 steps).\nI did not react as I should have I know. But I said nothing. I froze because that was a defence mechanism I had when we were together. This has obviously upset my partner because I didn’t defend him like I should have and then today (Father’s Day in Australia) I acted like nothing happened and further upset my partner. \n\nI don’t know what to do because my default is to be polite. I’ve conditioned myself to it. I don’t even know what i’m asking, I just don’t want to react like that to him anymore. \nApologies for the novel just trying to get all the information out.\n\nTl:dr \nNarc Ex threatens current partner with violence ( probably wouldn’t do it), I pretty much ok it with inaction because narc buttons. Don’t know what to do.\n\n",

        "text": "Probably like a lot of you, I have good weeks and bad weeks. For me, these ups and downs are predictably cyclical, so I usually have two good weeks, followed by two bad weeks. I'm female and the bad weeks tend to occur the week before my period and the week of, so I guess hormones are a part of it. To be honest sometimes I wonder if I'm just bipolar, though. Either way...\n\nDuring the bad weeks, it's much harder to get on with my day and I find myself much more vulnerable to the anger, despair, grief, and disbelief that accompanies memories of the abuse of growing up with narcissism in the family. Some of these memories are as recent as two months ago, some are much older. In my better weeks, I can deal with these feelings productively and almost use it as fuel to focus on the future and on my own wellbeing. In the bad weeks, however, it really does bog me down. I've been meditating, going to the gym, journaling, doing all that, but it's not really enough to... get out from under this dark cloud.\n\nIt's doubly difficult for me because I work freelance, from home, and really need to structure my days myself. I don't have that built-in structure of going to school or just showing up at work and trying to float through it. I'm in the process of trying to advance professionally and have \"extracurricular\" things I deeply want to achieve, but my momentum gets thrown off when I succumb to these moods and it can be deadly for my projects. It's just a really severe form of procrastination, in the end, I guess.\n\nWhat I want to do: go to a museum, watch movies, read books, go shopping, basically just escape. I want a diversion. Some of the things, like museums, are healthy and ok. Shopping is one that I've made a commitment to curtailing, because it's so easy for little impulse purchases to add up.\n\nI guess... I don't know... I just need some support or advice. What do you do? What have you read or watched that helped you? What do I need to know about this?\n\nThank you. I'm so grateful for this and the RBN communities on Reddit. I really feel like I've found my people. It's weird when the majority of posts on a sub hit home. It's been remarkably cathartic joining this sub.",

        "text": "Just need to rant, because it seems like no one around me is getting it.  After scouring through videos on Youtube I finally realized what it is.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago a teammember was transferred to my office, specifically to work with/under me.  She had a stellar CV but it wasn't working out with the previous team she was staffed on, so we thought maybe a change was needed.  We clicked right off the bat - had (seemingly) similar personalities, similar humor, etc.  I was initially super excited to be able to work with someone so apparently talented + got along so well together.  We virtually spent almost everyday of the past 3 weeks together - 12+ hours/day.  However, as these 3 weeks progressed, I noticed more and more troubling behaviors:\n\n- massive fluctuations in mood and treatment towards me - one moment we are best friends and the next we'd be arguing and she would just be off doing her own thing, sometimes even trying to form allegiances with others that she's been disparaging.  One day she'd be all smiles and the next she's confused about where the team's going to the verge of tears\n- intense paranoia\n- constantly reiterating that \"i've got her back\" as if I was going to betray her\n- I had to respond to her text messages immediately or else \"something's wrong\"\n- constant, pathological lying when it came to producing deliverables for work\n- sly, disparaging remarks about my incompetence at work (lol)\n- gradual attempts at trying to take over the project, disguised as \"just trying to help\" - in one of our last conversations/arguments, she even began a sentence with \"I'm not trying to cut you out from the projecct, but\"\n- attempts to frame our working relationship to the broader team that she was trying to help me - thank goodness I've already shown my ability to produce work\n\n\nThe smoking gun was when I discovered that she was plagiarizing work from another vendor and passing it off as her own.  I immediately requested she be let go, which the company did within a couple of days.  I couldn't physically bring myself to the office for those two days after the discovery because the feelings of disappointment and betrayal were too intense.  Apparently while I was gone she went around telling everyone how incompetent I was.\n\nIt's been a few days since her dismissal, and while a huge burden has been lifted off me, there's still this sense of unease which is difficult to explain to close friends and colleagues.  On an rational level I completely understand that she's been manipulating my pity and that her deceitful character shouldn't deserve a second thought.  My wife even thinks I've got a crush on her (yes I'll admit she's cute and quirky, but seriously that's not the issue).  At first I thought she was a sociopath, but after doing more research I realize it's more characteristic of NPD, and that I was in the epicenter of it for 3 weeks.\n\nThere's still this lingering feeling of loneliness, disappointment (like somehow I let her down which is completely insane), and this weird longing feeling to reach out to her to explain what the hell happened.",

EDad, as you would expect, refuses to acknowledge any abuse ever occurring, refuses to see any perspective other than his own, etc. He occasionally asks me if I want to get back together with them, to which I say \"no,\" and then he'll ask the same exact question a few weeks later, which I'll also say \"no.\" And then he'll ask it again, to which I'll ask him to stop, tell him I'm not interested, and say \"no.\" And then he'll ask again a few weeks later.\n\nThe way I currently handle communication with EDad is like semi-gray rocking; for instance, this summer he told me that he wanted me to have a \"courteous and respectful\" meeting with NMom. Whenever he does this, I keep it very unemotional and just say \"no\" or \"sorry, that won't work for me,\" even though I really just want to unload on him and tell him how I feel about his shitty behavior.\n\nEDad is 70. I realize he's going to die probably in the next 10 years of my life. It is _very_ possible that he will continue asking me to see my NMom and sympathizing with her as usual, and I will just keep saying \"no\" and grey-rocking until he dies. And once he's dead, there's no opportunities left to just go off on his ass and tell him how I feel about him.

Another reason is that I think she thinks because there’s no bounceback message that she might have a chance. She’s already tried stalking me at my house (had to call the cops to get her to leave) so I’m afraid a bounceback message will encourage her to take desperate actions. ",

They were there when I woke up from 2 weeks of amnesia from an accident bald in the hospital. They were there when I dated my new BF and we broke up. Then they were getting ready to move and I was sad. So I offered to throw a going away party.\n\nInstead of an acceptance of this I was met with disdain, that was shaming me for being a negative person (when granted I had LOTS of PTSD going on about a court date coming up soon) and was then FAT SHAMED, about recent weight gain. Shamed by the same girl I’ve done illegal drugs with and who I’ve wat he’d take acid. Was given long lecturing texts about health. \n\nThen she moved and I thought, well we had a rough last text talk but she would move on. And I had to. A month later I had to face my scary evil Nex in court alone, and found out how strong I, ME,MYSELF could be. I looked that fucker straight in the eye and won that fear contest. I’ve been working out 6 days a week not for the shame but for the will to get stronger for a certificate I’m seeking now in my job. \n\nI’ve reached out to her multiple times, sometimes saying I don’t know what I really did, other times saying let’s just get to know the new us and move on and other times just telling her I hope her new life is happy. \n\nAnd I’m met with a silence so deafening I’d rather be cussed at. Meanwhile she posts daily on her new insta of her yoga account which has over 1600 followers now.  Image seems the primary concern over character. Yet this wasn’t the girl I knew and I don’t know how to respond so I just keep trying to reach out now and then and be NICE. To nothing but hypocritical deafening SILENCE. \n\nWhat should I think? Was she one too? Was she only there for me to “look good”? I’m so confused. ",

I still haven't unblocked her from anywhere, the very thought of it makes me feel sick. While I'm still recovering from what I've gone through and slowly processing it (I recently realized she never had loving behaviour towards me, only controlling and all about herself, the red flags were here from the start, yet I didn't want to acknowledge something was off), I'm still left with burning questions on my mind.\n\nBefore I actually met her (we were at the same college but followed each other on Instagram until we met by chance IRL), she had a group of friends with whom she partied all the time. In that very group, she had a Turkish friend, and she'd always post stories about her, calling her \"my sweetie\" with hearts, but when we had our real first talk for the first time, she told me she felt lonely with her friends. I was going through the same thing, but it was because my friends weren't being here for me when I needed them (long story), and I didn't realize she was actually shifting her \"vampirism\" onto me. Then, as we got closer, I never saw her Turkish pal on her stories anymore, and never heard about her ever again. She had told me about traveling with her to Italy in spring (apparently a long-planned thing), but it didn't happen. The girl just vanished from radars. I've tried to find her, but nothing, while I once went to her profile out of curiosity. It's like she disappeared. I only heard of her when she was trying to find my friend in a crowd, but again, they didn't meet. I have a feeling my friend did to her the same thing as she did to me after, and I didn't even notice it at the moment, it was still the love-bomb phase. \n\nAlso, her ex-boyfriend, who was apparently a macho asshole who wanted her to cook and do the things. At the very beginning, she told me she wanted to kill him, she still owned shoes he had given to her as a gift, and ended up throwing them away after finding new ones with me. I find that it was really over the top to want his death...? But again, I didn't acknowledge it. Now that I've seen her true colours, I wonder if she didn't actually abuse him. From what I've seen, Ns have that thing of talking about their exes like they're Satan. \n\nI don't know how the hell I can get rid of those questions. I guess time is the best medicine, but I'm still left very... confused. Especially after finding out what was really going on.",

Or just so happy to be stagnant and status quo. Given all that I went through with my parents, and had the bravery to go no contact, I often feel like I don’t have anything to relate to with these people anymore. \nI do believe that with courage and bravery so many things are possible. In short, I find myself gravitating towards only positive people who are making changes in their life, and away from people who lack self awareness. \nWithout self awareness you’re just floating through life letting it happen to you.

I've been no contact with my toxic parents for a little more than two years, but there's one thing I had yet to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hadn't deleted and blocked my parents numbers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI held onto the excuse that I wanted to receive their texts in case something happened to my grandpa or perhaps even to them, but I was lying to myself- and to others. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally, I did it to give them a chance and to make myself suffer. Is it just me or is it weird when you suddenly don't have the toxic people and your life and life almost feels too free. Too peaceful? Sure there is stress and challenges and difficulties, but my parents (Ndad and Nstepmom) added a whole other element of fear, walking on eggshells, and a need to please them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally decided enough was enough. I posted recently about a flying monkey and a text from my Nstepmom over in RBN recently. My sister translated it for me and I felt so validated. \n\nIf you want to read the original...it's in my post history. The summary via my sister is this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"at least now I know...Why you have eliminated us from your life\" - S: oh...NOW you know? lol  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah. I like to say words about why I'm an amazing person and how I will deny anything negative about myself. You feel things, I didn't abuse you, and hey look you're alive, curing cancer and making all the money (Me: okay, not really, but our parents think this way for some reason -\\_-) so you must be successful. I won't apologize but you should forgive me because I'm a wonderful person who loves and supports you.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Also, don't play the victim because I'm the only one allowed to play the victim\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;S: It's interesting that she talked about \\[not doing any\\] physical abuse and name calling even though you brought up emotional abuse and she doesn't even touch that. It's cause she knoooooooooows, whether she hides it from herself or not.\n\nAnd that's when it hit me. All of the messages I get from them aren't about forgiveness or actual love. They just want to hurt me and draw me back into the web. Well, in my father's case, I'm pretty sure he thinks this is \"just a phase\". But there is no real respect or understanding. No attempt to want a relationship based on the truth. Just a need for others to validate their feelings and to serve them like in the past. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I've blocked them and deleted their contact info. I'm done. I'm done letting them hurt me and listening to their rants. I'm done giving them my time, my empathy, and my kindness. I'm done trying to understand what they really are saying when they write texts to me, because that's not how it should be with parents. I shouldn't need to translate their messages! So I'm done. And I'm relieved and free. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I had a rough time last semester just because I was so anxious about spending the entire summer with my family. The summer went pretty well, though, even got to repair my relationship with my brother and spend time with some friends I hadn't seen in a while, and Nmom mellowed out considerably. Still, being home just puts me in a constant state of at least low-level anxiety, and now that I know it'll be the longest I've ever spent away from home gives me the motivation I need to do a good job this semester and make sure it lasts.\n\nWhen I go back, my boyfriend picked me up from the airport, and we spent the night with his family before he dropped me off at college the next day. I had a small scare when he came in my room to wake me up, because for a second I thought it was my Nmom nudging me awake and that coming back was all a dream and I was still back home. I've also jumped a few times bc my apartment's AC turning on sounds like my house's garage door opening, which means my Nmom is home so I have to be on my toes from now on. \n\nOther than that, I've had a good time putting all thoughts of home aside and focusing on the present and future. I've stopped feeling guilty about not being 100% vulnerable with my Nmom, instead enjoying the freedom of being LC. I haven't gone NC for a number of reasons, but I'm happy with LC for now, and will go NC if necessary. When I say I don't feel guilty anymore, I mean that although I mourn what could have been, I don't let myself feel like a bad person for protecting myself and not allowing her more opportunities to hurt me. I wish I could be vulnerable with her, but I can't, and that's not my fault. The good news is I have friends and a boyfriend I can be vulnerable with, and I'm making sure they can be vulnerable with me as well.\n\nHere's to growth!",

It really helped to have someone there to reassure me that her actions were abnormal. \n\nI finally decided to walk away after she harassed me for not talking to my sister-in-law after she broke into my parent's house and assaulted someone. My mother is upset that I have a very good relationship with my sister and her husband - she does not. She believes I should be \"empathetic\" to my SIL and forgive her. I suggested that I would talk to her but would voice my thoughts on the inappropriateness of her actions, to say the least. This happened in the beginning of this year. Since then, my husband has commented on how well I am doing- the rise of my self esteem, increase of happiness &amp; gratitude and overall positive mindset shift.\n\nHowever, I struggle with the guilt of not wanting to maintain a relationship with my parents and how I will handle their end of life needs. People outside the relationship, in-laws and certain friends cannot wrap their minds around walking away from your parents. My mother was a master manipulator. \n\nMy mother had texted me a few months back asking me to be power of attorney on their living wills and I denied it. My sister is now taking that role. My parents are  both in their late 60's and not in great health. I always wonder when I will get that call and how I will deal with the news. Even through all of the negativity and abuse, I still do love them as they are my parents. I wish for a miraculous turnaround- where we could be a normal functioning family. To be fair to myself and my husband, I've had to admit this will never happen. \n\nAny insight would be helpful, as this is the last thing holding back further positive progression in my life",

An obsession starts to form itself, and you can pick up on this if you pay close attention.\n\nIt's like the N is a walking magnet, and your thoughts are little paper clips.\n\nWhen a N hooks your attention and puts you under their spell, it's like they tune you in precisely to their radio frequency, so that you can never turn them \"off\" or change channels. My friend said it's like they are a television that's always on in the background. You can't turn them off, because of the Magnet Effect. They are continually sucking and taking your energy and your attention, like walking magnets.\n\nSo pay attention early on after meeting someone new, and if they are having the Magnet Effect on you (you find yourself unable to change channels and not think about them and you notice that an obsession is forming) that is a HUGE red flag that this person is not safe.\n\nIf you notice, the people in your life who ARE safe do not have the Magnet Effect, and do not trigger obsession in you.\n\nWith my last N boyfriend, I noticed the Magnet Effect very early on. I have a very vivid memory of sitting with some friends last summer, 2 or 3 weeks after meeting him, and I couldn't focus on the conversation. I was thinking about the N, and how I was supposed to call him after, and I remember a part of me was watching this whole scene from a distance, and some wise/self aware part knew that there was something off about how obsessive I was already feeling towards this new guy. I even thought to myself, *\"This is how it feels when a N comes into your life - all of your thoughts and energy start to orbit around them, whether you like it or not.\"*\n\nEven though I had that flash of awareness that turned out to be prophetic, bc that guy was very much a N, I dated him anyway and paid the price. I noticed the Magnet Effect after only knowing this person for a couple of weeks, and I want to make sure I notice it going forward with other people who come into my life. I think now it's one of the most reliable indicators that you're dealing with a N. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

So, I wasn't allowed to talk with him or see him while I was living with my Dad and his wife. \n\nMost importantly, the sister I told him about is my stepsister whom I love so much. \n\nI wish my life was black and white without all of this mixed up drama. I hope to someday give my kids the life I wish I had. Like, only one Mom and one Dad. No \"that's not my kid. So, you cant talk him\" drama. No abuse. No money troubles. No B.S. \n\n\nI wish to give my kids the world. ",

So, this isn't, and probably won't be my first post tonight.\n\nAlmost a year ago (it doesn't feel like it) I went NC with my Nfather. I'm having a hard time with it only because I KNOW that after my letter that I sent him. He doesn't want me back in his life. I know this because he told my younger sister. \n\nI will say: I wrote some pretty nasty stuff. At least, that's how I feel. I basically  wrote out every way I had tried to be a good daughter since I moved out. I wrote out all of his responses (which he can't deny because I saved EVERYTHING). I wrote out why I didn't want him in my life anymore, and what he wasn't allowed to do anymore. \n\nI typed it out into my notes section on my phone. Then  two weeks letter I wrote it out. Signed with my new name (I had gotten married and changed my last name) and mailed it to him. He received it the day before Thanksgiving. \n\nI have made a promise to myself that in order for me to heal and get better. I will NOT call him names but instead use my words to describe the emotions that I am feeling. This is the rule for my journal, this is the rule for when I am talking with my therapist, and this is the rule for when I am talking with my husband.\n\nSo, Tl;Dr the hardest part, for me, about going NC is knowing that after everything I have written to my Nfather in the last letter I wrote him. He won't want me back in his life. I KNEW before sending the letter the consequences. Sometimes, though? The thought of not having a Dad that loves and cares for me is probably the most depressing thing. \n\n",

        "text": "So, some backstory: growing up I was taught \"other people before you\" which, honestly, can be a REALLY good trait if used correctly and appreciated by the people around you. When I was a teenager my nfather married his 3rd wife who is also and N. Fun fact: she saw the \"other people before you\" trait in me and used it to her own advantage. I ended up being her maid, emotional support, the quiet listener, the one that would see that if I did as she said it would make her happy. So, naturally, she took advantage of that. Whenever she was sad. I was there. Whenever she was angry or not feeling well. I was there. Whenever she needed someone to keep her company. I was there. \n\nIn the last few months my roommates (who are related) have been going through a REALLY rough time. They've had multiple, unexpected, family losses. That's hard on anyone. \n\nSo, I'm terrible at helping people when they're grieving. That's always been my downfall. I haven't experienced grief first hand, yet. So, it was weird for me. We are all very close. Anyway, so, my first thought when I saw them both grieving was \"them before me\". I did what I could to help out and be there for them. However! I knew and began to recognize when I needed my own alone time to rest, recharge, and do my own thing. This is something I have never really done. So, it was kind of a big step for me. \n\nIt sounds really selfish, but generally, I am a very introverted person. I need my \"me\" time, and like I said taking time for myself is huge for me because it means I'm taking care of myself too 💓 \n\nTl;Dr: basically, it's important to take care of yourself if you are taking care of others.

I’ll tell you this much, sometimes anger is the easiest accessible emotion, and for me over the last few months anger was just that. I had trouble feeling joy, I had trouble feeling sad. In fact, it was my trouble feeling sad that was the most difficult. I wanted to feel true sadness, I wanted to grieve, I wanted to cry. But in fact I just felt annoyed and angry all the time. When I stop judging this, it’s slowly started to show it’s true face. This anger was hiding so much grief underneath, but yet that grief was so overbearing that it was hard for it to come through and show its face so easily. Our emotions are in layers, and thus also release in layers. Give yourself patience, give yourself no judgment, be careful with only “feel good” advice, and go with what truly feels good in your heart. ",

My older brother has always been temperamental but I never saw it as abuse until I started educating myself. Even after I learned some things about narcissism I told myself that he just has major fleas.\n\nHowever, he keeps getting into this pattern with my mom where he will pick a fight and cut her off from seeing his daughter. Then he will come back a week or two later and act like nothing has happened. He keeps picking these fights on birthdays and holidays, which I've read is a narc trait. He has done this again today. \n\nI have decided to have an honest talk with him. Every Thursday,I pick up my niece from school and keep her til my brother gets out of work. This Thursday I will talk to him. I plan on telling him that I no longer intend to be a bystander while he uses his little girl as a weapon. If he will not let me take my niece to see my mom, I will go NC with him as well. \n\nMy mom is planning on going NC with my brother due to this pattern happening over and over again in the 5 years since my niece was born. I am willing to continue speaking with my brother if he acts rational about this so that my niece can have a positive role model. \n\nWhat I am afraid of is violence on the behalf of my brother. He is not tall but he is very muscular. I plan on bringing my fiancee as back up but I don't want him to get hurt either. He's not as strong as my brother. He has never put his hands on me but I'm afraid that he will because he has hit our mother. \n\nAm I making a mistake confronting him? ",

        "text": "Lately, I've been struggling with my unhappiness about the \"friends\" area of my life.  I have no close friends, a handful of acquaintances I keep at a distance, immediate family that I have nothing to do with, and extended family that I keep at a distance.  My current bf is the only person I really feel comfortable being open to.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with my extended family.  I really like them and I think they are fun to be around.  I am afraid to forge close relationships with them because of the seemingly pattern of abuse I've been through with my Nmom, previous friendships, and a recent relationship.  I am afraid to be abused again.\n\nIt seems to be a pattern I keep repeating over and over throughout my life.  My mother was abusive and my immediate family didn't really have friends because of it.  The only people that would be our friends were other unhealthy people that were abusive in some way.  My classmates' parents would walk away from my mother at school events and the kids of those parents would do the same to me.  I've often felt very lonely growing up.  My friendships seemed to always be drama or they would steal from me or steal my boyfriends.  \n\nIt feels like that only people that want to be my friend are narcissists,self-absorbed, emotionally unstable or gossip-y people.  I'm getting drained from these friendships. I'm tired of listening to people put themselves on a pedestal, gossip negatively about other people, create drama out of small things, or just monologue at me for an hour before I suddenly say \"Oh look at the time, I gotta go. Sorry!\"  I would rather spend a significant amount of time alone. That is the only time I feel good.  But I also feel so lonely.  I often talk to myself because I want to socialize.  Myself never talks back, or gaslights me, or tells me I'm crazy, etc.  I'm keeping people at a distance and I dont want to.  I dont want to push them away or keep them at arms length.  \n\nI love my career and landed my dream job a few months ago.  I am happy with who I am and how much I've grown through the years.  I'm proud of myself for setting boundaries with the 2 most narc people in my life and got away.  I don't stress about money because I am doing well in that department also.  Money can only go so far.  I am just unhappy with the relationships I have had and want healthy ones.  I just am afraid to go out and find them and not sure WHERE to find them.\n\nI'm pretty down right now and could really use some \"uplift\".  Not suicidal, that would be a waste of everything I've worked so hard for.  Just looking to get past this \"roadblock\" I'm experiencing.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I need support right now.\n\nI am an alienated parent of a child that I had with my N husband (Nex for 9+yrs). When I left that abuse situation, I fled for my life across the country, instantly becoming penniless, jobless, and homeless, and I went into hiding, because my Nex had stalked and followed me after previous escape attempts. \n\nFinally, over the course of the divorce proceedings, a judge compelled me to return my child to the man who abused me over 8 years, as a matter or jurisdiction - my statements and evidence to the court didn't seem to matter at all. The physical violence, and the profound psychological harm I had endured over those 8 years seemed to matter for nothing. I still have legal custody, visitation, phone calls, but guess how much of the court-ordered parenting plan has been followed? I haven't seen my child since 2016.\n\nAt the time of the divorce, our child was a toddler and had not been physically abused by the father. That responsibility was given to the grandma, who my child has shared a bedroom with ever since. \"Spanking\" and physical \"discipline\" are not illegal in Florida where they live now - with what I consider to be a poorly-defined exception of \"unless resulting in harm\".\n\nOver the last week, following nearly a month of radio silence from my child, I received written messages from my kid online, *for the very first time* documenting specific instances of abuse and neglect. Finally after calls to CPS were made, they visited the home and concluded that it would not be safe for my child to remain in the home.\n\nOn Thursday evening (Aug 23 2018) he was brought to the hospital, and he remains there now (as of Aug 26). I get to call throughout the day and talk to him and he is in much better spirits. \"*I'd rather be here than at home*,\" he said.\n\nI can't begin to imagine what my child has gone through. But I will do everything in my power to get him to safety, now that I have evidence enough that he isn't safe at home with his Father and family there.\n\nWhat my son said to me reminded me of the 8 years I was with his father. When CPS showed up on Thursday, he said he could hear the adults in the other room. He was messaging me online during the visit and said \"*He's telling them I'm lying*.\" He wrote to me \"*if they don't believe me and leave me here again I'm going to get beaten*,\" and I had to beg him, in all caps, not to let them get away with it, especially since CPS was there in the moment. I was \"screaming\" in all caps for him to run out there and chase after the officers if he needed to, and to treat it like it was a life-threatening emergency.\n\nI felt like I wanted to jump through the phone and stand in front of him to protect him in this horrible situation. It was the most awful feeling in the world, being so far away and feeling so powerless to do anything. It has felt that way for 9 years now. \n\nFinally they (CPS officers) came in the room and talked with my son and got him out of there. Waiting by the phone to find out what was going to happen was the most pulse-pounding experience I've had since the day I ran for my life, 9 years ago.\n\nI started a fundraiser so that I can raise enough money to hire an attorney, and get a judge to listen and hopefully, finally,  take decisive action to get him out of there and into safety with me. So far I have been wowed by the strong opening of the fundraiser and I'm looking for ways to signal boost it so that it gets fully funded. If you have suggestions about that, I really appreciate it - I don't use Facebook or Twitter, so my reach on social media is limited.\n\nMy hope is that when my son is discharged from the hospital he won't be returned to that situation where there is a possibility of further violence. As to the likelihood of that happening or escalating further - CPS's investigation and assessment is ongoing. Right now I don't have any information about that.\n\nI have a home, and my son already has his own room here - fully furnished and just waiting for him - because I refuse to become hopeless about being his mom and I am prepared to take him in at a moment's notice. I already have airfare taken care of.\n\nIf you have any words of support, kindness, any suggestions, advice, or referrals, I'm very happy to receive it. The more attention this gets, the more likely it is that the right people will see it and bring long-awaited justice, and freedom, to my son.",

A Discord group where I'm and where most of my only friends are is always speaking about relationships. It triggers me and fill me up with anger inside. I should in those moments maybe just disconnect from Internet and take a break, yet I don't know how to find healthy comfort (not relationship related).

        "text": "Brief introduction: I'm Italian, I had to go no contact because of an emergency situation, and required so to save my life. It's been 2 weeks, now I'm troubled with something bad that awoke my past. I am trying to apply for an pair families, but lately it's been harder than I expected to deal with my trauma. I've got a self help books and made slow progress, it's a very long journey. Though it's amazing how I healed in such short time, considering how I arrived, nearly dead both physical and psychological. Yesterday I want to respond to one of the families that contacted me 1 week ago as a small accomplishment. It's all set up, I'm calm, I did some mindfulness breathing and body scanning, I had done some flashbacks preventive maintenance. But, when I go to the message they are asking for WhatsApp number. Ugh...\n\n\nConsiderations: phone numbers in my country require an ID verification. A process that last some days on a store, and a week or so online. This is a one of the many useless law we have and doesn't really protect anyone from anything. I actually didn't like my phone carrier because it's known to scam, like many others, and wanted to change to a new provider who advertise itself as more honest than all other Italian providers, and what they're offering is great. I ordered this SIM card through this provider and wanted also to change number sice that could be useful (I wasn't programming go NC, but the following one week I had to). It's all done and the delivery company is supposed to come, scan my ID, take a photocopy of my document I had to already have. They come 2 days later but I'm not ready with the photocopy, I had no printer and didn't go outside to a store, I did not even imagine that was required when I bought the SIM (they also scan the document). I don't open the door, I know that they always have to try 2 days, so the following day he would have been there again. I go to make a photocopy and I make all ready. The following day I wait all day but nobody comes. He just write on the daily report I was not in the house, quite popular trend in Italy when they're in hurry or just don't want to work. The following day I had to go NC, SIM lost. The delivery company should return the SIM to the phone carrier company but since they're incompetent, it's weeks they're just trying the shipping over and over lol. I could tell them to ship it to my new address but I'm scared my abusive parents would get the address somehow, maybe asking one of the workers. Or tell them to send it back to the phone carrier and organize a new shipping witch would only make me deal with a more serious company, who don't have any contact with my family. \n\n\nSo I was stuck with the old number. Till I can manage to get that one or find a solution, I install a call blocker and block all calls, best way to avoid pain and I didn't needed calls.  I also block most of the senders for SMS. I could enable calls for some hours if I needed receive something important.\n\n\nWhatsapp is an app bought by Facebook witch never cared about the safety of their users, clearly. Anyone can contact you, regardless if you know them, if they are on your contacts. It doesn't work with email because it went popular advertising itself a a simple app in countries where people weren't able to use email and password. It only register yourself with a number, and it can only be tied to 1 account. One can block contacts but they've to contact you first, then you've to open the messages, go through three menus, and confirm a warning. One sure is gonna read those messages, not something is gonna influence WhatsApp business so they'll never take care of that. Of course, an abuser can just borrow a phone and send messages, my mother is particularly good at falsely looking motivated by  good intentions.\n\n\n\nI go desperate, I start looking all virtual numbers. This is something that script kiddos and people who dislike  giving out their number to a company use. They're numbers that can receive sms, you see the sms and can bypass the verification. Problem is they're overused and over popular and number get linked to a WhatsApp account fast, witch probably then flag it as a virtual number too.  I try them all. There are also usually premium numbers one can buy, but none is Italian. After all, there's the ID law regarding phone numbers, and the country numbers aren't popular like US or UK. I find one that doesn't work, even I spend hours and hours waiting and trying. One scam 3 EUR. One doesn't eventually work. Most of them didn't have Italian numbers and I thought giving a foreign number to an au pair (family from UK, me from Italy), would raise some red flags. \n\n\nI am almost crying, what it had to be simple and small accomplishment before bed time, now keeping me awake all night and stressed. Why, why does trauma have to do this? And toxic shame came in too, of course. I eventually decide to use my number and I soon as I open WhatsApp, the phone freeze for minutes as I receive 500 messages or something like that. It almost crash the app and the entire system. It was my abusive ex, I don't remember if I blocked her, perhaps I just uninstalled the app. I thought she'd have forgot about it a day or later but mind you, it's borderline and it has caught a nice prey. I feel like crap. I already had deleted all those photos and it took me a long time to remove them all on the phone. Weeks of safety, I almost had arrived to the point I was peaceful and felt safe in my surrounding. All back now!! Too much, too injustice, nearly impossible to get away on some situations. I open them while.my phone is slow, tap all the stuff, I read some messages unfortunately doing so, then block, then I wait one hour. My birthday comes to mind, the day I wanted enjoy this year, am I going to receive messages from abusive people? No, I had arrived to the point I had started image of friends in my mind rather than abusive people. 1 hour later conflicted, I remove that piece of crap of an app. All night I try to find a solution but there isn't much.\n\n\nThings could be for example, propose Skype,  explain the situation, or try to use a foreign number and pretend I had kept the number from when I was traveling (but it would really looks strange cause in EU no citizens keep foreign numbers, they're small country, but very different culturally). Explain the situation.. I don't know if they'd understand, an abusive ex is more easily understood than abusive family, and I could use that even if it's just a part of the issue. But I'm just an applicant, they're very interested, but I don't want to give them troubles like they'd choose someone else because it looks with less problems or more trustworthy. Receiving the new number, the problem is the deliveey company and it'd take a long time, I don't have much money to pay my rent left, so I've to go fast now, safely but fast. \n\n\n\nDo you have any advice? ACoN would handled trauma well can say how I could explain myself properly without JADing (see ACoN post about it) or without raising flags (that aren't relative to my personality, but rather, my past, witch should has nothing to do with the present). Another solution could be the foreign number but as I said looks strange. Proponing Skype means there are other people with WhatsApp who gives less troubles. Last but not least everyone use WhatsApp and not having it could be looked like a flag, actually I don't have friends, but not because I'm unfriendly, more because I'm just getting out now from the abusive concentration camp, that was my family and town.\n\n\nTL;DR well, installing back whatsapp on an old number to get in touch with an au pair family brought back a lot of stuff, I has reached a point when I wasn't tortured by nightmares and heavy fear anymore, not that much. Now is all back. I explain why I had to use the old number, why is difficult get a new one, why whatsapp and ask advice how handle this kind of things professionally. To do so I vent a little bit actually, but I also explain the situation properly. Please when you have some time, read my full post.\n\n\nTypos: non native, mobile, a little stressed, forgive me if I made some.\n\n\nI really appreciate any kind of advice you can provide. I also appreciate comments and anything you wish to say regarding the situation.",

        "text": "So, I was reading one of the narcissist subreddits and someone mentioned wanting to warn the new source and a comment suggested sending a book such as Psychopath Free to her. \n\nWell, I got it in my head to do this. I looked up the ex (one before me) on Facebook. I wondered how I would feel even just looking at her.  I once had so much contempt for her. At some point I realized he slept with her during our relationship during a friend’s wedding. I was so mad. I confronted him about it. He denied denied denied. Now I realize they were lies. Thank god I’m two years past that time and it doesn’t hurt or make me angry the way it once did.  At one point he even suggested we all have a threesome which excited me, but also made me jealous. Whatever...\n\nBut when I pulled up her Facebook page. Wow... nothing but heartfelt compassion. I no longer thought she was the one manipulating him. I no longer thought she was ugly. I just saw another beautiful, most likely empathetic person who got trapped by an abusive man. I have no idea if the things he told me about her were true, but I do know on her Facebook page she is a therapist now. Another ex of his is a psychologist. And I want to go to Psych Nurse Practitioner school. \n\nI bet he loves that he fooled two therapists (at least) for some time. Idk where these women’s journeys are, but it seems he still has contact with them.  I was supposedly the first one *he* broke up with.... therapy does wonders to strengthen and make a person healthy and not put up with shit any more. He couldn’t handle my healthiness. \n\nSo, I was as like, “yeah, I could send her the book maybe, but what good would it do?”  I realize I had to figure this out myself. Friends told me he was cheating and I didn’t believe it, my therapist knew he was abusive (but her method is to let me figure it out), and still I didn’t believe what was right in front of my eyes. He was wonderful, handsome, intelligent to me. \n\nI can see how he set it up. Calling me on the phone and going through a Borderline Personality Disorder questionnaire after I got blackout drunk because I was miserable with him even though he has no psych training. Then breaking up with me and telling me he thinks I definitely have BPD. Dude, you’re almost 40, live with your grandma, and make nearly minimum wage.... what training did you get to see this? I work with a daughter of a Narc friend of his. When He broke up with me I got so paranoid. She looked at me weird on the rare occasion she saw me. Maybe I was just being paranoid, idk. Ugh anyway. Of course I have no founding for any of these intuitions,  but it doesn’t matter. \n\nBecause I’m free! He discarded me! No contact for a year!!! I have him blocked on everything! I don’t give a shit if all of his flying monkeys think I’m insane because I can expect the best and get it. I am a wonderful, kind, compassionate person who is generous, loving, caring, and honest. \n\nHaving been abused multiple times in my life this is a tremendous thing for me. I deserve to be with someone who also possesses those qualities. \n\nI wish you all the same. \n\nAll this to say, no, I will not be sending the ex Psychopath Free. It’s not my job. She can figure it out herself. Otherwise I will be labeled even crazier than they all thought. \n ",

        "text": "Hello! I am completely new on here and I found this sub after doing a research about NPD...This is going to be a long story and it will be about an 'online friendship' instead of a relationship or dating.\n\nI am posting here because after telling this story here on Reddit and somewhere many said this guy had strong Narcissistic traits and after reading many articles about it I suspect it as well. Since people on here have some experience with people who have NPD I thought you might 'give me a hint' or not.\nSorry if I make random mistakes but English isn't my first Language. I rechecked convos so I know I am not imagining things etc\nI know I cannot get a real diagnosis but many things sound so familiar...I want to know if I have been used/manipulated or not.\n---\n\n\nLast december I was through a phase of loneliness and depression. I discovered Reddit and I decided to start venting about my issues. Once I wrote a long post about my situation and I randomly received a PM from a 20 years old guy.\nHe told me he decided to PM me after reading my post, he said he was isolated and had very few friends since HS, went through similar stuff but at some point he decided to move on etc\nHe wrote I sounded like an unique person since he had 'himself as an example', people didn't understand him and his way of thinking blah blah blah but he never had actual depression because he was 'strong spirited'.\nHe offered to talk on another social media and I accepted it but then he proceeded to tell me all his accompliments (I am at one of best universities, I do this and that, I aced 91% in x subject after a lot of hard work…).\n\nHe also told me he got cheated on after a month and a half of dating by a girl and told me to not worry if I didn't have much romantic experience in my life. He claimed he was 'surprised by all the similarities we had' (which is very ironic considering how things ended).\n\nI thought he just wanted to help me out so we started talking on a regular basis. The first week we talked almost everyday. He asked me about my life, school, if I took pills or not, my hobbies etc\n\nI was happy to finally have someone to talk to and share all my thoughts, I thought I found someone who actually listened and understood me.\n\nOn a regular basis we talked for once or twice a week for a while. At some point I realized I considered him more than a friend, I have never been really close to someone of the opposite sex before and I have no experience in dating (I am a kissless virgin actually).\n\n\nHe asked me a lot about school, my ambitions, my grades etc and he was always boasting about his accomplishment.  I am from Italy and he said he had European origins as well, he talked in general about news, the situation in EU, social events, politics, hot topics like LGBT issues or multiculturalism, immigration… We always found stuff to talk about even if I didn'tknow anyting about his field of study (computer science) and it was fine for both.\nHe always said how Canada was great to live in and it was a good idea to move there in the future since I hate where I live so much but I am not 100% quite sure about my future plans though.\nI also vented a lot about how much I was frustrated about my life, my depression and my worries so I guess I thought he wanted to motivate me. He gave me some advice on how to handle it which was useful but I remember in January we had an argument about this because he didn't seem to understand depression at all. He also knows I have Maladaptive Daydreaming since I mentioned directly in that OP on Reddit and I told him as well.\n\nHe said something like 'if you were enthusiastic about school you wouldn't have time for depression' which really irked me. My depression is mostly situational/environmental but he made it sound like it was a choice.\n He claimed I needed to 'do something about it' and I wasn't the only one on this planet on had issues etc, the same BS I hear from my parents as well. I started feeling kinda bad but he started saying I told him I spend all my time on FB (I think I told him I spent too much time on it but not all my time, I couldn't even find my convos and he use the excuse that his Messenger deletes convos).\n\nThe day afterwards he apologized and said 'he had the purest intentions' and I thought I overreacted and I was too sensitive so I told him to not worry. His ways were always really polite and kind in general, so we continued talking.\n\nHe often randomly messaged me during his breaks and stuff and we talked pretty often, I am saying this because it is relevant to how things ended.\n\nOnce at the end of January I told him some random older guy was sending me compliments and pics of flowers and I thought it was funny and was like Lmao too, he wanted to see because it sounded weird but he wasn't a creep or anything.\n\nWe continued talking and at some point after the convo was dying a bit (we talking about mundane things like celebrities) he randomly asked how things with guys were and if I got attention from guys lately.\n\nI was like nope since I barely went out and he told he got attention but he dismissed it because he was too busy to consider dating, when I questioned the reason why he asked he was like 'I was just checking that out, just curious'.\n\nI got a little too excited and I ended up confessing I liked him more than a friend. He replied he wasn't suprised at all because 'people are predictable', he thanked me for my honesty etc\n\nWhen I questioned what he meant he said that if you observe people you notice a pattern based on how they act and they can be quite predictable so you can 'understand them better'.\n\nI wondered if he liked me back and he said he wasn't interested in dating, he didn't want to feel things for people and he locked those feelings down in order to be productive. I expected the answer to be positive but he said I understood his question about guys and he was just curious, it was 'bland and straightforward for once'.\nHe also told me he rejected more than one girl at uni who asked him out in real life.\n\nI was like no luck, ok, but then we continued talking again. He repeated many times he wasn't uncomfortable because 'it is impossible to make me unconfortable' and he didn't mind my feelings at all. He apologized for 'making my evening worse' that night and I was a bit disappointed, was it possible that I misunderstood anything? He messaged me so often, he seemed to be really interested in my life and we could talk for hours. When I said I didn't like how I looked he said 'you seem like an attractive girl' (based on the pics on FB).\n\nEverything appeared to be normal, he asked if he could help me with HW, about school in general etc\n\nI clearly remember I complimented him about how smart he was for being able to do well in such a fancy university, understand difficult concepts and once he said he had an IQ of over 148 or something. He was often boasting and he was well aware since the beginning I didn't know much about this stuff.\n\nI confessed that my relationship with my parents is a bit meh sometimes and they don't understand my depression at all because they are a bit closed minded about this kind of issues. He said that it isn't healthy at all (which is true) and all we do is shame one another, for many reasons.\n\nI asked him if he has ever experienced depression and he said he didn't and he was just alone throughout his HS school years. I was confused because I clearly remember he told me his parents wanted to put him on pills (I reread it many times so I am 100% sure) but he said they got worried once because they were 'always worried about me' but he was too mentally strong to experience depression blah blah blah. According to him he was just sad for short periods of time and sometimes because 'school material was too easy' or other petty stuff.\n\nI reasked him again why he decided to message me again because the thing 'I wanted to help you' thing wasn't fully clear. He replied he wanted to give an hand during hard times because I had no one to talk to and then we became friends.\n\nAfter a week or two I went through a phase of deep depression and misanthopy and when he messaged him I mentioned it, we talked briefly and things were pretty negative because it fell into a spiral of negativity which was very hard to get out from.\n\nHe tried to make me feel better but at some point he disappeared for a couple of weeks and he turned off notifications, then I confronted him directly but he was like 'I am not sure why do you want to see if I am online or not, I am busy with exams and I have a life on my own, I don't sit online all day long' but all I wanted is a 'I am busy, I cannot talk now.' because since he disappeared I thought I said something wrong.\n\nHe also hinted that just because he offered to help it doesn't mean I can 'take advantage of him' when in fact I just wanted to know why he didn't reply abruptly.\n\nHe got offended that I assumed he was a sly asshole who blocked me without a real reason and just because I tagged him a dumb meme that said 'thank you for tolerating me' which was just ironic and not serious. He wanted to add that it is a bit tough for him to talk to me because I am very drawn to negativity.\n\nAfter a couple of week everything went back to normal and he messaged me again. We continued talking but I decided I would wait for him to message more, I didn't want to seem insisting and in the back of my mind I wanted him to seek for me more.\n\nOnce or twice I told him that I felt sad because I kept thinking that nothing more than a friendship could happen between us but he was like 'not sure what you mean' so I had to explain things very directly. I had very fuzzy feelings for him so it was overwhelming sometimes and I ended up telling him...I feel stupid for it now.\n\nHe told me he appreciated my honesty but I felt this way about him just because I didn't met enough nice people in my life, he added that being friends is technically having feelings etc\n\nHe said he wanted to help me out, he asked me if I ever had a relationship etc\n\nI asked me if he had sexual experience but he replied he didn't and he didn't care at all, because dating and relationship are a total waste of time for him.\n\nHe confessed he doesn't masturbate and he doesn't like watching porn but what irked me is when he said masturbating for guys is 'pathetic' and it is not the same for girls because its effects on mental health etc For him suppressing sexual desire is a way to control the beast and be in control of your body because 'feelings are just a chemical reaction in your brain and you don't feel anything for anyone if you disable them'\nFor him romantic stuff is just a waste of time blah blah blah, I felt stupid because I was thinking a lot of the idea of dating etc His favorite was 'needy' since he called people who have (romantic or/and sexual) needs that way.\n\nI didn't have many crushes and I think he was my first even if it is just a guy met online. I told him so as well.\n\nAnother time I was venting about how I didn't always enjoy being female because women are constantly judged for looks (more than men at least), we have to deal with harassment etc but he misunderstood one part and said 'looks are the reason why people are attracted to each other' then we restarted talking about dating again. I also remember he said it was an interesting topic once.\n\nHe mentioned how being hot is different from being attractive, how celebrities look plastic and fake and about his very high standards that no one has ever reached. \nWhen I wondered what he meant he said he has the image of the perfect woman in his head with very specific standards for looks and personality (the ones about looks were so specific like hair type, symmetry and I was like what the hell?).\n\nI felt kinda bad and I thought I didn't match his standards and it was the reason he rejected me. He dated one girl but he claimed she used him for her grades and then cheated on him but it was a 1 and an half thing.\n\nI found the 'high standard thing' offputting but I had a soft spot for him because I thought the bad past experience hurt him really bad.\n\nI went through phases where I liked him a lot and others when I tried to forget about it since I had no chance with him.\n\nFrom the end of may to the beginning of july he found a lot of excuse to talk like sending me random stuff a couple of times a day just to break the ice, ask me random questions etc\n\nWe talked normally again despite everything but at the beginning of july I broke down again after talking all night (I was frustrated because of loneliness, lack of understanding from my parents etc) and I told him again how much I liked him etc and hoped for me.\n\nHe said it was impossible because 'it is best if we stay just friends' and he wasn't interested in dating since it is a waste of time for him and he also believed in male-female friendship because he had a lot of female friends etc\n\nHe mentioned the high standard thing but when I asked he said it was situational and he wasn't just interested, the standard were secondary etc\n\nAfter 2-3 days he messaged me again and we talked briefly for half an hour or less then he said 'good luck with your studies' then he disappeared again.\n\nAfter a month I tried to break the ice (I didn't message him because I needed an emotional break) but his reply was cold and two-words like.\n\nHe was often online but he didn't message anymore until 3 day ago when he said it was better if we parted ways since we 'didn't have nothing in common'. I was like not surprised but the excuse was absolutely ridiculous since we talked for HOURS despite everything.\n\nWhen I said it was hilarious (the excuse I meant) he was like 'I don't care about the appreciation for the things I do but calling my intent to help you hilarious is over the top since I spent hours talking to you and motivating you, goodbye'. Then he blocked me without even letting me speak!\n\nWhat the hell? I did tell him I thought he was just using me to stroke his ego after he message me to tell 'goodbye' and the excuse was very bad. It didn't make any sense.\n\nAlso I spent 6+ months, thanking him, telling him how grateful I was and how much I liked so wtf?\n\nMany said he has strong NPD traits but I am not sure, what do you all think? Do I have a point? I feel kinda bad because I spent so much time obsessing over him and I feel like something was taken for me now. I opened up with him and he called me a 'good friend' only a month and a half ago...so why?\n\nI have had a feeling that there was something else about this guy and I couldn't place what it was, many when I asked advice said he sounded weird or that I should have stayed away from him or that the whole thing was off.\n\n\nAll the time he boasted about having a meaning in life, wanting to change the world, wanting to help and he mentioned more than once how nice he was bla blah bla ",

I just felt really powerless and disrespected today and I need to vent.\n\nI had to move in with my dad temporarily while I get my finances in order and find another apartment. He's renting a room from his friend, lets call him J. \n\nSo, I had just come back from having pizza with a friend. I set my leftover garlic knots on the counter. My dad is making pasta and meat sauce. Everything's chill until we hear someone try and open the front door. We hear some grumbling. Dad goes to open the door. J and his friend walk in drunk.\nJ: Why is this door locked?\n(dialogue I can't decipher) \nDad goes back to cooking. J and his friend drunkenly try to pry some homemade caramels out of the ice cube tray. They succeed. More conversation. I don't know I was on my phone hoping they'd go away soon because even though they weren't talking to me I was uncomfortable. J's friend leaves. \n\nJ picks up my bag.\nJ: What's this?\nMe: Garlic knots.\nJ: What?! \nMe: Garlic knots. \n\nJ asks dad what he's making, even though he already asked him prior. Then he says he's gonna order in but first he's gonna take a garlic knot. He takes the bag. \n\nI say nothing because what I'm gonna fight him over one? \n\nJ (passive aggressive): She didn't say 'yes.'\nMe: You know what, it's fine. \n\nJ huffs away angrily. Dad tells him \"It's okay she's just in a mood.\" (Jesus what the fuck dad?!) \n\nJ goes upstairs and we hear banging and cursing. Dad tells me he's a mean drunk. It'll pass, but he's letting us stay here so I should show a little more gratitude. \n\nI'm livid at this point because he's such an enabler. He did the same shit with my former Nstepmother when they were together. \n\nMe: First of all you pay rent and second, I'm sick of people who act like this. You can't take someone in out of \"kindness\" and then walk all over them, or get pissed at them for taking your charity. J's been a dick to me ever since I got here. \n\nHonestly, I'm more mad a dad than I am at J. I'm willing to bet that J isn't gonna remember the exchange when he sobers up. Either way if he wants to be a dick in the morning I'll deal with it then. I'm just so fed up about being seen as ungrateful when I maintain my boundaries. I don't touch HIS stuff! \n\nAnd then dad has to tell me to behave because he doesn't want to stand up for me to save his own skin. Fuck this. I can't wait to leave. \n\nThanks for reading &lt;3",

        "text": "So, I'm just fretting. Which takes up so much of my life.\n\nSomeone called me paranoid the other day and I thought it was funny/weird so I told the story to 2 close friends...they were both like LOL um you ARE the most paranoid person we know :/ :/ I was so shocked they both felt that way...I guess it's just the water I learned to swim in, constantly worrying about other people and what terrible things they might do next.\n\nSo, I take private lessons in something from a teacher I've been with for several years. She's both brilliant and flaky and I've made maybe steady but slow progress with her. The chaos she brings to the table though is a CONSTANT challenge, cancelling probably 40% of appointments, rescheduling, not being clear about expectations...basically a perfect situation to practice boundaries, or a total nightmare if you grew up with narcissists lol. Sometimes I get really fed up with the inconsistency or last-minute stress or interrupted progress and I think about leaving her and going to another teacher, but the most I've ever done is contact another professional and talk, but I never wound up actually going to them.\n\nUntil today. I got cancelled yet again early this week and I was so mad, I looked up someone else and actually set an appointment. Tonight I went to the new person and...I don't really know how I felt about it. I don't know that I liked them better. And now all I can think about is how small-world this little niche is, and I already know they know each other, and I can't stop worrying that my teacher is going to freak out and drop me for going behind her back. Which, I think would probably be irrational...but I don't know for sure bc I only understand narcissists so I don't know what's normal, lol. And like I said, she does behave erratically so I'm not convinced she's NOT a narcissist in which case I could be reading the situation totally right! Which is scary. \n\nI'm just so nervous about this whole thing. I can't stand not knowing, I want to run in there tomorrow morning and spill my guts, hurry and tell her my way with my spin on it before she hears from the other teacher and goes ballistic...but I can't get in till next week and wtf with the hurrying anyway! I just don't want to stew in this worry for days, I'd rather have the blowup soon so I can just KNOW- bc ofc I don't really know how not to fret about this any way other than to get it over with. That sucks. \n\nI don't want to be paranoid. Who wants that?! But I have to acknowledge too that there are times with the narcs I grew up with that being vigilant probably saved my life...so I can't beat myself up too much about the habit. It's just that I can't control it, it's so hard to know where vigilant applies but paranoid isn't warranted. And how to put aside the worrying and analyzing and trying to get ahead of problems that haven't even shown up yet-? I know this isn't the end of the world even if the worst thing happens, and there's a chance that she would understand, or not hear about it, or not care or idk, a bunch of reactions that aren't I HATE YOU YOU'RE DEAD TO ME...but it's hard to convince myself when the catastrophe scenario looms so large. \n\nAnyway. Probably not as much advice as support, I know you guys know what it's like to live with residue that hinders your normal life so I just wanted to get that out. Frustrating.",

This is because when you were raised by a narcissist, we develop certain patterns and fear-based thinking. It is important to know that healing is now about undoing these behaviors, it is about you. None of it is about them. It may be from them, but is no longer about them. ",

        "text": "Apologies for the long post but I had a lot to say! I have recently developed feelings for someone (who I'll call \"B\"), and went to meet him for what seemed like a date a few days ago. I was surprised when, as soon as I got there, he started talking about some other girl and asking my advice. I kept wondering where I went wrong, and how did I misread his intentions so completely?\n\nI wanted to write out what happened and get perspective from people, as I'm suspecting he could be an emotional manipulator. I'm worried I *could* have just gotten involved with N #3 (I have two N exes). I should mention that I met him as part of a Meetup group for loved ones of Ns. He has had a rash of them in his life as well.\n\nTo me the biggest indicator that you are potentially dealing with a N or other emotional manipulator, besides a lack of empathy, is **hot and cold behavior**. Normal people are *consistent*, and don't treat you like their favorite person on Wed, and then on Sat can't be bothered to reply to your texts.\n\nWith B, he definitely does the hot &amp; cold. He runs hot usually when we are in a group. He will single me out with lots of focused attention, heavy eye contact, delicious private smiles, shared humor and he will look at me in a way that makes me light up inside like a Christmas tree. I can feel that he is always looking at me or noticing me. He will cross rooms to come and talk to me.\n\nThen, when we are hanging out just the two of us, he is different. There is only a \"friend\" vibe. He is much less gregarious and seems more reserved and withdrawn. Two of the times I've gone to meet him for dinner, he launched into talking about some other girl who lives in a different state who he's supposedly been hung up on for years. Huh?? One of these times he even asked for my advice about her!\n\nThis happened recently, and just the day before we had been texting for hours, talking about life and our families and the things we're passionate about. I would *not* have this kind of text convo with a man I am not interested in. It was the kind of fun back &amp; forth you have with someone leading up to a date with them.\n\nI've been wondering why I've been having serious butterflies about this person, and feel so incredibly attracted to him, bc he's not my type. He's way too young for me. Then it hit me that the reason I feel so smitten with him is bc I was possibly *manipulated* into having these feelings thru the \"hot\"/lovebombing behavior... singling me out with lots of attention and intense eye contact and creating this vibe between us like we are partners in crime.\n\nI realized that my feelings of attraction exist for a reason - bc he put them there. He is not someone I would have looked at romantically, ever. But he intermittently makes me feel like we have all this chemistry and connection, while other times he just treats me like a friend.\n\nYou know who else I experienced this exact pattern with? My first Narc. I met him in college, and he was younger than me, and not someone I would have ever seen as a potential boyfriend. We had very different lifestyles. But, he worked his magic, and put his spell on me through a similar pattern of intermittently love bombing me. Sometimes he would become my soul mate, and true love, and other times he would be indifferent, like an acquaintance. He would go so far as to sleep with me as part of his love bombing. I fell madly in love with him, and had absolutely no idea that he was a N, or even what a N was.\n\nMy first N also would randomly talk about another woman (his ex girlfriend) as a distancing technique with me. I remember one time we had had sex, and we went out for a drink after, and he casually announced that he was thinking about getting back together with his ex. I felt like I'd been socked in the gut. He was supposedly hung up on her, the way that B is supposedly hung up on the girl who lives in another state.\n\nIt has been a big moment of growth for me, to realize that I am likely feeling emotional confusion around B, because he has created that confusion with his mixed messages and hot &amp; cold.\n\nMy first N told me, in a rare moment of honesty, that back when we were in college, he used to have this game of targeting someone and becoming her friend, and making her interested in him. Once he was sure that he could have her if he wanted to, he would pull back, and stop distinguishing her in any way, other than as a casual acquaintance. He said some of these girls were angry at him, as they should have been.\n\nI have to wonder if B is possibly doing some version of this to me, like he's manipulating me into liking him, or he's putting me under his spell, in order to extract supply from me (attention and admiration)?\n\nIn the past, I would have had no insight, and would have thought that my attraction to him was genuine, and that it meant we have a lot of chemistry. I can see now that what he's been doing to me looks an awful lot like push-pull - pushing you away, and pulling you close, pushing you away, and pulling you close. The classic playbook of emotional manipulators.\n\nMy friend, who knows very little about Ns and spotting manipulators, said that maybe he just wants to be friends, and he suspected that I am interested in him, and so he started talking about this other girl in order to give me the message, in an indirect way.\n\nBut I know what it feels like to have a one sided attraction to someone who just wants to be friends. We've all been there. A normal, nice person who just wants to be friends, will consistently treat you like a friend! This is how I treat men that I am not interested in, that I suspect might be interested in me. I am friendly, but I give them NO encouragement and NO mixed messages.\n\nI think I'm old enough and I trust my gut enough that I can identify when I'm having butterflies for someone as a direct result of behaviors on their part that are giving the impression that they are interested in me. In regards to B, I can name very specific things he's done that have caused me to feel drawn to him. This feeling didn't just spring up on its own. He's been giving me encouragement and has created this mirage to draw me in.\n\nThe biggest thing that worries me is how intensely I feel pulled/attracted to B. I've learned thru therapy that I have a weakness for Ns, and that they are drawn to me as well, thanks to my N parents. I usually don't feel this strong of an attraction, and it reminds me of how I felt towards my first N, when I met him back in college. So many things are reminding me of my first N.\n\nI've learned that seeing these red flags early, is super important, before you get attached. It's a critical sweet spot when you are still able to walk away without having to suffer. I'm wondering if that's what happening to me now - am I catching this early, when I can still distance myself without it being too painful?\n\n​",
