The Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial.  Each one has *enumerated* powers, meaning powers explicitly written into the Constitution for that branch to exercise.  In theory, this would help stop the concentration of power into one branch.  However, overtime, Congress has delegated powers to the Executive branch (as well as to its independent agencies) to carry out laws created by the Legislative branch; these powers are sometimes referred to as apart of the \"Administrative State\".  For those wanting more information before posting, I've been given permission to show an Intelligence Squared debate on the subject.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYZ-1TK9pyc ",

Reddit's admins asked us to post about this and link to [their blog post](https://redditblog.com/2017/09/25/reddit-is-partnering-with-national-voter-registration-day/) on the subject.  \n\n---\n\nNow with the PSA part out of the way, I'd like to ask about the merits of automatic voter registration, whose goal is to make things like National Voter Registration Day unnecessary.\n\n[Ten states currently use some form of automatic voter registration.](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/automatic-voter-registration)\n\nIn general, such policies automatically register voters when they interact with the DMV [unless they opt out.](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx) Though Alaska does it when people get [their permanent fund dividends.](https://pfd.alaska.gov/Automatic-Voter-Registration)\n\nIn all states, there is an opt out, as opposed to the opt-in of the [motor-voter act.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Voter_Registration_Act_of_1993)\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of moving towards a system of automatic voter registration?  Should a federal automatic registration law be passed?",

And yet aid is getting to Puerto Rico from the Federal Government:\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/devastated-puerto-rico-needs-unprecedented-aid-says-governor/\n&gt;GOV. RICARDO ROSSELLO: First of all, we are very grateful for the administration. They have responded quickly.\n\n&gt;The president has been very attentive to the situation, personally calling me several times. FEMA and the FEMA director have been here in Puerto Rico twice. As a matter of fact, they were here with us today, making sure that all the resources in FEMA were working in conjunction with the central government.\n\n&gt;We have been working together. We have been getting results. The magnitude of this catastrophe is enormous. This is going to take a lot of help, a lot of collaboration. So, my call is to congressmen and congresswomen to take action quickly and conclusively with an aid package for Puerto Rico.\n\nA few articles mention that Congress should move faster to get relief aid out the door but those packages are to pay for debts incurred during the recovery (http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/29/hurricane-harvey-republicans-relief-aid-packages-242136), they don't actually direct the initial response.  After all, various organizations with the Government from FEMA to the Department of Defense are all already working in Puerto Rico.  \n\nHas the Trump administration's relief response been adequate? Is there more it could or should be doing?  \n\n-------------------------------------\n\nEdit:\nSince I originally wrote this yesterday evening and didn't get around to updating it to reflect a few changes requested by the mods until earlier this afternoon, there have been some better articles with information about what has been done or what more could be done.\n\n\nThis article covers a lot of what the current ground conditions look like in various parts of the territory.\nhttps://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-us-virgin-islands-caribbean-impacts-0?cm_ven=email&amp;amp;cm_cat=BreakingNews&amp;amp;cm_pla=contentTitle1&amp;amp;cm_ite=https%253A%252F%252Fweather.com%252Fstorms%252Fhurricane%252Fnews%252Fhurricane-maria-puerto-rico-us-virgin-islands-caribbean-impacts-0\n\n\nSeveral places have reprinted a FEMA announcement about what has done, although I can't find the original source.\nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/26/trump-puerto-rico-response-243146\n&gt;FEMA told Congress Tuesday morning that it had 500 personnel on the ground in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and thousands of federal personnel across departments were in the areas. The agency also said that 7 million meals and 4 million liters of water were en route by barge.\n\nThere is also an update that the USNS Comfort is being deployed to the area as called for by Clinton.  Although the Navy has provided a justification for why it wasn't deployed originally:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/09/26/clinton-pressured-trump-to-deploy-hospital-ship-comfort-to-puerto-rico-now-its-on-the-way/\n&gt;But the Navy’s presence was scrutinized. Thomas LaCrosse, the Pentagon’s director of defense support to civil authorities, said Monday that U.S. officials discussed sending the Comfort to Puerto Rico last weekend, but ultimately decided not to because ports were not ready to handle a ship that large after the storm.\n\n&gt;But LaCrosse and other defense officials argued that the situation this time was different. The Puerto Rican government did not ask for more Navy ships, but logistical support that includes getting its 60-plus hospitals up and running, LaCrosse said. In light of that, the Pentagon made the judgment call to send in a fleet of Air Force jets loaded with supplies and medical personnel beginning Friday, after the Army Corps of Engineers re-opened Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, he said.",

        "text": "As we know, the healthcare system of U.S. is very complex. Pharmaceutical companies, insurers and hospital conglomerates are the three biggest stakeholders, each with their own economic interests.\n\nHowever, the current healthcare debate is focused on cost control at insurance, and especially on government's role in providing health insurance. Indeed, if the insurers had a stronger incentive to [haggle with the health service providers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2011/08/22/hospital-monopolies-the-biggest-driver-of-health-costs-that-nobody-talks-about/#b5d0d972ce8f), that could provide some momentum towards a competitive market.\n\nHowever, the insurers are hardly the only factors in high medical cost. The lobbying efforts of medical trade unions, e.g. American Medical Association, [effectively creates a shortage of healthcare professionals](https://mises.org/library/how-government-helped-create-coming-doctor-shortage). And the hospital conglomerates, [having been consolidating their power through mergers](http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/content/tags/hospital-employment/monopolizing-medicine-why-hospital-consolidation-?page=full), have huge leverage over insurers: Insurers are not willing to risk losing their business by haggling with the hospitals, so instead, they resort to their market monopoly and pass the cost down to the policy holders by increasing premium.\n\nThere are many measures that can potentially address the supply side issue. For example:\n\n1. Raise the quota on annual residency\n2. Raise the quota of National Interest Waiver green card for foreign physicians who agree to work for several years in underserved areas.\n3. Implementing a \"public provider option\" (as opposed to, or along side, the \"public (insurance) option\")\n4. Restrict hospital merger\n\nEach of them has their own pros and cons, but the point is that their are many such measures---yet they are not the focus of healthcare reform. So what are the merits of focusing cost control efforts in healthcare at pharmaceutical companies and insurers, versus doctors and hospitals (not limited to the 4 example measures above)?",

        "text": "A friend and I were looking at some data recently about household income, wealth distribution and poverty between ethnic groups in the United States over time.\n\nThe data seems to indicate something happened in the ~~mid-to-late 90s~~ early 2000s that caused a sharp dip in median household income among minority families, and an increase of minority families below the poverty line, but we were curious as to why that was the case.\n\n[This Census visualization from '76 to '12](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-median-income-in-the-us-by-race-2013-9) shows a sudden drop in median household income among minorities around 2000. While white families experienced a very slight dip as well, all minority groups took a sudden and relatively deeper dive just ~~before~~ after the year 2000, and continued to drop through the next couple decades.\n\n[Figure 2 on this page](http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq3.htm#Figure 2) shows that the decline of blacks and Hispanics in poverty suddenly stopped and poverty of those groups began increasing again around the same time. Figure 3 on the same page shows the poverty rates among children in those groups, which is even more prominent.\n\nDespite the amount of data, there's not a lot to go on for why the sudden shift. Typically when you see spikes/dives in large datasets like these, there's one or a small handful of factors that can be identified as causual.\n\nWhat happened in the ~~late 90s~~ early 00s that would have contributed to this?\n\nEdit: folks have pointed out the graph indicates a change in the early 2000s, not the late 90s. Should have put my glasses on!\n",

It interacts, as Cowen's article cites using census data, with globalization, job stability, regional diversity, and professional licenses.\n\nIt's fair game to critique this thesis, but I'd like to operate on the assumption that it's probably true enough to warrant policy experimentation.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- What polices can states implement to ameliorate hurdles/incentivize moving and regional diversification?\n- Same as above, but at a federal level?\n- Any additional suggestions, e.g., municipal perspectives and so forth.",
