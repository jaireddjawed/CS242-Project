        "text": "Gonna separate this into two parts. First, a bitter pill that I'm pretty sure I'm going to get hate for. Second, a solution that I'd like to suggest for those who agree with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love Linux, it's great. Things just became easier when I started using it. Here's the issue: people say that Linux isn't good for the average user... I am actually going to take that even further and say **\"Linux isn't good for anyone who isn't a programmer\"**.\n\nI am not biased one way or another, and I agree with the FOSS philosophy and everything like that. However, being completely honest here, I am not going to use a program if it provides me no *significant* *benefit* over what I am already using.\n\nThe keyword here is \"significant\". People say things about how Linux respects your privacy. How FOSS is better than proprietary. I completely agree with that, and I love that. I search for FOSS software whenever possible and usually prefer to use FOSS software over alternatives. **Despite that though, I still use proprietary software.**\n\nThe fact of the matter is that a sensible person will not use something that hinders them. Linux might have all these benefits, but if it doesn't make someone more productive, or worse, it makes them less productive, then why would they use it?\n\nI am a programmer. Linux 100% makes me more productive and using Windows for development gives me physical pain. However, other people on my team don't use Linux, because they aren't all programmers. Linux hinders them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want there to be a movement to make Linux mainstream. The benefits of Linux are too powerful to leave under the realm of programmers and I believe that it should care more for the common user. I will agree that people who don't know computers shouldn't use Linux... but I don't think that is an excuse to keep Linux as convoluted to get into as it currently is.\n\nThe GUI of popular Desktop Environments need to start taking notes from things like Windows or Mac. Different parts of the system need to be dumbed down for the user who doesn't understand the difference between Memory and Storage. The Terminal should not be a necessity to learn and the user should be able to interact with their system purely from the GUI and nothing else.\n\n**I'm tired of core system software requiring to be configured through a text file that sometimes requires you to learn a completely new programming language just to get intended behavior. I'm tired of software with no manual, or a manual that assumes that you live in a nuclear bunker.**\n\nI know that what I am saying is a common sentiment. **However, I don't think that this sentiment is being properly acted upon.** The closest that we have to proper attention being applied to this issue (that I know of) is something like Ubuntu or System76. Even then, there's still an assumption that the user knows what they are doing.\n\nWhat I am asking for is a concentrated effort from developers to try and get Linux to a state where it can be a **first choice by someone completely new to computers**, comparable to Windows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes a movement like this exist? If not, can we create one?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*P.S. I rushed this. There may be grammatical errors or misinformation. Please feel free to call me out on anything.*",

So they are not \"movies\" or anything that would lend itself to a nice \"Netflix-like\" GUI with cover pictures etc.  Rather I just need something where I search for file names.\n\nI'd like something basic that is similar to MPD.\n\nRight now, I have the media files (both music and videos) on a samba server.  At the TV/stereo, I have an old laptop running linux that is connected to the TV with HDMI and stereo with SPDIF.  On that laptop, I run MPD for music, and I like the way it works.  I can use various MPD clients to tell the laptop what to play.  For example, I can sit in the easy-chair with another laptop and control the music.\n\nFor video though, it is kinda clunky as I don't know a similar app.  I can VNC into the laptop, use a file browser to select a video, and launch the desktop player, then backout of VNC.  It isn't very practical if you want to fast forward, etc.\n\nHowever is there something similar to MPD that would do the videos (or both video and music).  So I would envision I sit in the easy-chair with a laptop, and through a browser I could connect to the app on the laptop at the TV, and I could search for media by file name, launch media, control media (fast forward, etc).

        "text": "I've been an Ubuntu fan for a while now. I recently replaced my development laptop (13,2 Macbook Pro) with a newer MBP and thought it'd be \"fun\" to see how well Linux performed on it.\n\nSo far I'm underwhelmed, mostly because of the (understandable) limited support of Apple hardware, e.g., Touch Bar, Touch ID, etc. (As an aside, I've found this GitHub repo very helpful: https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux )\n\nI know this is more of a kernel/hardware question but I've been living in the Ubuntu eco-system for so long and am more of a peripheral member of the Linux community but thought I could benefit from tapping into the Reddit hive mind.\n\nFWIW I'm a Web Developer by trade and my needs are more experimental than practical. I have no interest in/need for considerations pertaining to AI, gaming, graphic or video streaming, at least as far as my \"ideal\" distro search is concerned.\n\nLastly, I found this article a good jumping off point: https://history-computer.com/best-linux-distro-for-macbook-pro/ \n\nThanks for reading this far. Blessings to all.",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm making this post to ask for feedback on the moderation of /r/linux. When I was added to the mod team there were very strict rules about moderation that I didn't always agree on, but with the removal of the previous mod, most of those got dropped.\n\nBut there are some topics that I still tend to remove even though they get a lot of upvotes (but also a lot of reports) because I personally find them rather boring / repetitive and raise the noise floor on the subreddit.\n\nBut I don't want to make this decision on my own, so I'm asking for your opinion. Those topics are:\n\n - Screenshots of Linux installations. I find them cool if it shows some exotic / vintage machine, but installing Linux on a new laptop is no achievement, so what's the point? Maybe having a dedicated thread for this would be enough already.\n\n - In that vein, \"Linux Success stories\"/Journeys. I find those highly boring and they always give off a cultish vibe. Especially when they come with a long rant on how bad Windows is… \n\n - Support questions / discussions. This isn't always so clear cut. There is a dedicated subreddit for Linux support and I think removing those is pretty uncontroversial. But often discussions about what is the best tool for xy also get reported and I'm unsure if this falls under the support umbrella or if it is generally interesting.\n\nNow the question is, should I make those decisions at all. One the one hand Reddit already has an upvote / downvote function, so why not let the users decide?\nBut then we also ban meme posts, because funny posts will get much more upvotes than 'serious' ones and they would quickly drown out all other topics.\n\nSo what do you think?",

It was running a version of linux that the IT department maintained themselves I think, although I am not 100% sure of that. It was pretty bare bones, as I recall, and at some point I had to enter some sort of information via vim, having never even heard of it! As you can imagine, I had no idea why I couldn't type anything, with the cursor blinking back at me, and then after mashing some keys and something odd happening, I realised I had no idea how to back out. After an embarrassing conversation with the IT department, I decided to learn how to use linux and I went through the whole vim tutorial. I went back to windows ultimately, but after using ubuntu to revive an old laptop I never looked back!",
