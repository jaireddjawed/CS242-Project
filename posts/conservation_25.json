I have only a little, having:\n\n(1) lent a hand on a small farm a few times (ongoing), where I learn from the owner about organic and sustainable farming;\n\n(2) volunteered with a local preservation council to restore an ancient monument, where I chatted with postgrads in the environmental sciences about their work;\n\n(3) participated, in a small capacity, in a conference about sustainable farming at the university to which I wish to apply.\n\nMost of my 'experience' has been from my room, reading environmental philosophy, or on my hikes, where the occasional raptor sighting gets my blood flowing. My place of work partakes in environmental activism and schools its employees on permaculture, its present focus being on the effects of palm oil production, i.e. deforestation.\n\nMy question is where to reach out to to get more experience before applying, which I'm encouraged to do as soon as possible. I intend to contact local university environmental societies, but there seems to be a drought of opportunities during these winter months. Any and all help is very much appreciated!\n\nBest wishes.",
