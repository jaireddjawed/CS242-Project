Here's the story of my first proper espresso grinder from 2011.\n\nMy good quality closest coffee shop was closing. \"Nah, espresso is like $2000 to do right, not going to try....\". Then I found a lightly used **Gaggia Classic** (without knowing their reputation)  at a thrift store for under $100. Bought!! So now I need an espresso grinder. The rule of thumb was to spend some multiplier of the machine on a grinder.....\n\nI found a local commercial kitchen reseller on ebay with a nice looking **Mazzer Super Jolly** - these are heavy and not easy to ship so I ebay searched for local. $400 got me the Mazzer Super Jolly in good condition and a dozen commercial 3oz Espresso cups. I also accidentally bought a full size traffic light from them....\n\nThe closed coffee shop offered me two different MSJ grinders for a bit less than what I paid maybe a week after I excitedly said \"I have a machine, need a grinder, you're closing, how much?\". \n\nThe burs on the one I bought were in seemingly good shape but I ordered new ones because I wanted to be sure I wasn't using a bad grinder. Also ordered $100 of \"accessories\" for my new espresso machine - more on that later...\n\nI have run it for 10+ years, doing maybe 1kg/month (2 doubles @18g when at home, not always at home) which in American is three of the 12oz bags most 3rd wave shops sell in a month. It's an anvil in terms of reliability. I did a deep cleaning when I decommissioned it in the end of 2022 and now it's in my office not grinding coffee. \n\nAnyone new to the hobby looking at \"expensive\" new grinders with Internet presence should consider **really big and heavy grinders** from commercial kitchen resellers.\n\n\nI suppose I need to have some pictures?:",

My husband and I recently moved, and our French press was lost in the process. I find myself going to my local coffee shop far more often than I should because I really just don’t like using our Keurig. \n\nI’ve read that a pour over brew is smoother than a French press, would you say that’s accurate? \n\nI feel like this is a dumb question, but does the actual pour over maker matter? Aren’t they all just glass? Is there “better” ones than others and what makes them preferable?\n\nGrinder. I would like to grind at home. I drink one-two cups a day.

I've seen coffee recipes and suggestions on lowering temperature so coffee wouldn't taste burnt. \n\nI kind of doubted lowering temperature 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit could make much of a difference. I ordered coffee from a roaster that I saw a lot of people suggest.  I brewed it in my Stagg X and I couldn't taste anything except a burnt flavor. I tried Jonathan Gagnes Aeropress recipe using the same temperature of water and all I could taste was a burnt flavor. So I stopped using the coffee and set it aside.\n\n So after not using the coffee for awhile and using my Fellows Drop coffee instead. I decided to try it again this morning. I thought what the hell I'll lower the water temperature by 5 degrees this time. I went to take a sip of the coffee expecting the worst. I was surprised it didn't even taste like the same coffee this time!  It was a much lighter coffee with flavor notes that weren't there before.\n\n\nThe only thing I can contribute to the drastic difference in taste is lowering the water kettle temperature. I am amazed such little tweaks can make such a huge difference.",

I tend to really only adjust grind size, holding water temp (208-210F) and  pouring method constant (using v60), so it may seem like I have my answer, right - just grind more coarse. However, that bitter note is often accompanied by notes indicating under extraction (weak body, quick finish, very bright - almost sour), so it's hard to know which way to go to get the most out of the cup.",

This happened at Zeitgeist yesterday. Is this like cash payments, where businesses used the pandemic as cover to phase out something burdensome? How burdensome is it to serve in and wash mugs? Is there any real connection between mug policies and the pandemic? I strongly prefer ceramic if I'm sitting down for coffee, and am surprised by cafes leaning into the waste generated by disposable cups, but I want to be empathetic if there's some good reason.  I'm curious if anybody here has deeper insight or the cafe perspective on this.",

Some of the brews I made seemed to take a very long time which is a bit concerning. I recently started logging my coffee pours, so here are a few examples:\n\n* kalita wave, 20grams of coffee, 320grams of water, grind setting 4 -- 9:00+ brew time (stopped early)\n* kalita wave, 20grams of coffee, 320grams of water, grind setting 6 -- 8:45 brew time\n* chemex,      35grams of coffee, 560grams of water, grind setting 10.4 -- 11:00 brew time\n\nThese are not typical brew times for the size of pour overs. I should note that these pours used water from the Zero water filter which has been fine in the past (normally I use distilled water + third wave, but don't have any atm). I should also note that these were all light roasted coffees. \n\nI have reached out to Fellow to make sure there is nothing wrong with the grinder, but I wanted to see what others experience has been like with this grinder. I am guessing this is not normal, right?\n\n**note: this could very well not be an issue with the grinder and possibly the water I'm using**\n\nHow can I check that everything with the grinder is properly functioning? Thank you in advance for your help and time; it's greatly appreciated!",

However I notice that the French Press cup is a lot less caffeinated than the pour over, typically with pour over I feel a good amount of energy from it throughout the day while French press I feel like I could use the second cup. Here are my current recipes: \n\nPour Over: 24g coffee to 350g water, bloom pour wait 30 seconds, pour most of rest of the water (about 250g), let water filter through and pour the rest (let brew til about 3 minutes). \n\nFrench Press: Mostly just simply doing a 30g coffee to 350g coffee and letting immersion happen for about 5 minutes. I tried doing a cover grinds and stir with wooden spoon for 30 seconds and then pour rest of the water and didn’t seem to make much of a difference. \n\nI am using a hand grinder (Timemore C2 Max) which can really only grind about 30g of coffee at a time, so if the solution is to do more coffee for French press thats fine but it would also be nice to have another method.",

        "text": "I had been using the Gen 1 everyday for a while now. Drip, pour-over, French press are my usual suspects. No espresso of course. The Gen 1 was fantastic, but it did have some flaws that have been covered many times: Static (pretty bad without RDT), hopper having larger beans get stuck, gen 1 Burrs being so so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gen 2 initial impression**:\n\n**Looks** \\- About the same. No big difference.\n\n**Hopper** \\- Fixed. I have tried beans that often get stuck and have had no problems. The increased size is lovely for when I have guests over and want to make larger amounts of coffee.\n\n**Grind** \\- Still very pleasant sounding, but it does have a slightly higher pitch and metallic nature that is a touch less pleasing to the ears. Seems about as quick to grind as the Gen 1. \n\n**Gen 2 Burrs** \\- It does seem more uniform and performs better at the lower grind setting by the naked Eye than Gen 1. I tend to drink light and medium coffee and have found the taste to be slightly less muddy and sweeter than before, but I am no expert here. Again slightly higher pitched and metallic, but not as much as the SSP.\n\n**Static** \\- Night and day difference without RDT. Before it was a mess without RDT, lots of retention, little tiny zap when you grabbed the cup, harder to pour out of the container. Now in the Gen 2 it is a lovely experience.\n\n**Cup** \\- Slightly bigger with a slightly easier to remove lid. Not a huge change but nice again for larger batches when guests stay over.\n\n**Knocker** \\- Why am I even mentioning this? Sounds silly, but I find the new knocker to sound much nicer. Far less metallic and \"?clangy\". Also don't have to use as much with the new anti-static bits.\n\n**Knob** \\- Still has steps. Lighter touch to it. Meh.. kind of a push. Both have a nice feel.\n\n**Overall impression**: \n\nLargest difference is of course the new Gen 2 Burrs which can be had for \\~$80 dollars for Gen 1 machines. Easy install. \n\nNext big thing is the anti-static bits. \"You loser just RDT those grounds my dude!\" The problem is often guests and family use the grinder, and I don't expect them to RDT so naturally the coffee station turns into a hurricane of grounds (which I don't blame them for as the machine is a static beast).\n\nAgain for guests, the larger hopper and cup are nice features especially after the many times family came to find me for beans getting stuck in the old hopper.\n\nDo I recommend the upgrade? It depends.\n\nIf you are generally the only one using it, I'd just upgrade to the Gen 2 Burrs or the SSP and continue to RDT.\n\nIf you are tired of the mess/static, many others use the machine, and/or are able to sell the Gen 1, then perhaps.\n\nCheers from a rambling coffee noob!",

How different companies source beans? About any other aspects of running or working for a coffee business? Well, ask your questions here! Think of this as an AUA directed at the back room of the coffee industry.\n\nThis may be especially pertinent if you wonder what impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the industry (hint: not a good one). Remember to keep supporting your favorite coffee businesses if you can - check out the weekly deal thread and the coffee bean thread if you're looking for new places to purchase beans from.\n\nIndustry folk, feel free to answer any questions that you feel pertain to you! However, please let others ask questions; do not comment just to post \"I am _______, AMA!” Also, please make sure you have your industry flair before posting here. If you do not yet have it, contact the mods.\n\nWhile you're encouraged to tie your business to whatever smart or charming things you say here, this isn't an advertising thread. Replies that place more effort toward promotion than answering the question will be removed.\n\nPlease keep this thread limited to industry-focused questions. While it seems tempting to ask general coffee questions here to get extra special advice from \"the experts,\" that is not the purpose of this thread, and you won't necessarily get superior advice here. For more general coffee questions, e.g. brew methods, gear recommendations for home brewing, etc, please ask in the daily Question Thread.",

However, Costco pre-ground in a shitty drop machine isn’t my favorite. Anyone have any great experiences with a brewer with built in grinder that’s under $300? I’m flexible on the price but I don’t have $1K to throw away. Any advice is much appreciated! Thanks in advance from a coffee noob.",

(which I grew out of when I was 14) But for some reason the last few times I've made coffee for myself and my partner (no matter what method I'm using) My partner's coffee will taste burnt but mine will taste fine. I make them the same way. With the same pot. Same amount of milk. \n\nFor reference, I mostly use a chemex with water heated on stovetop from a gooseneck kettle or I'll use our relatively new espresso machine. \n\nIf anyone has any insight to help I would greatly appreciate it. I really want my partner to enjoy their coffee.",
