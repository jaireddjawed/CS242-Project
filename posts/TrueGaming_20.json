        "text": "Every game , that has physics has physics objects , but I love when developers use them in game's world(POGW- shorter version). Best example for this is none other than Half Life 2. \nPOGW added so much to game's world . In this game you could pickup any small to middle props , and that added so much realism and immersion to the world. There were many destructible props , you could use POGW in your advantage when fighting enemies and so much more. One example is in Half Life 2 episode 2 , where you have to get to the higher floor but there were no ladders or anything . In other games you would have a specific object ( maybe a red box ) , that you should place to get to the second floor, but in HL2 you could pick up any object and stack them , to get the same result , HL2s world felt like a real place. In other games usually everything is glued to the ground , in a result game world sometimes feels static. There are examples of POGW in different games . For example , the fact that you could smash into a street post in GTA , and it would fall down , added so much to the game . Same can be said about Max Payne 2 ,  where physics objects showed the destruction of your shootouts , or in Skyrim where you could take the shot arrow from someone's body or steal something from shop , if you take it further from someone's eyes . But I understand that these physics objects could be used to exploit or break a game, but I still think that we need more of them. How do you think?",

Others also suggested that realism is not a selling point when trying to sell a game plan to a studio.  Further still, several people expressed other problems that realism is not economically feasible in the industry from the standpoint of development.  That argument goes, \"The industry will never cater to  a 5% minority who notice these things.\"\n\nIf all these things are true, then what can we say about the  adoption and consumer reception of VR?    What role will **immersion** (not necessarily realism)  play in the future of gaming?\n\nYour thoughts? \n\n ",

        "text": "Let's talk about crafting in games! I've picked up Fallout 4 again after a long break and I get reminded how fun it is to craft things in it, both weapons and armor. You can literally spend hours fine-tuning all your equipment, and every new weapon is an opportunity to customize to your needs. The automatron DLC is also a wet dream where the options for making your perfect robot buddy is near endless. \n\nI ask myself what it is with Fallout 4 that makes it so much more fun and addictive than other games, where it sometimes can get quite tedious... Here's my thoughts!\n\nThere are a lot of meaningful choices to make when upgrading the equipment. Every piece on every weapon is interchangeable and many mods completely change the function of the weapon instead of just being stat increases. You want to make your automatic rifle into a sniper rifle? Sure go ahead why not. \n\nI also feel excitement over each new modified gun, I just can't wait to try it in the field. I think it succeeds in giving a feeling that every weapon can be special: even the lame early game weapons could be modified to something special, making the experience rewarding throughout the entire game instead of just being a mechanic for acquiring the best gear: crafting is always relevant and circles around many small upgrades instead of just big expensive products. \n\nThe gathering of materials also feels very physical as you are literally scavenging old ruins picking up junk manually, but once home at the base they are easily transferred to the workshop and the resources are automatically available so you don't need to worry any more. There's no tedious \"refinement\" like melting steel needed: it's always clear if you have the resources or not and how to get what you are missing.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Did you also enjoy the crafting in Fallout 4 or disliked it? Did I miss any giiis points? And what other games are there that in your opinion totally nails the crafting aspect? \n\nHonorable mention to the last of us, where it feels grounded and deeply connected with the gameplay and setting: searching for supplies and making equipment on the go feels so purposeful and only adds to the immersion rather than breaking it.",

        "text": " So I was reading [this article about](http://www.siliconera.com/2018/08/21/soulcalibur-vi-gets-a-gamescom-2018-trailer-adds-tira-as-a-pre-order-bonus-dlc-character/) Tira from Soul Calibur being dlc in this new installment. Some people seem to be mad and I don't blame them because gamers are usually mad at this TYPE of dlc (even though there is a possible misunderstanding). People have been mad when this was first introduced and they are  going to continue to be mad until it stops. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever a bunch of video  game journalist when this first began predicted that if consumers did  not speak with their money. It will become mainstream, then get even  worse. Which it has, but the worst it has ever got is star wars  battlefront 2 and that some how managed to roll itself back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere  is a brighter side to this and it is just up to developers. Expansion, monthly subs, dlc, season pass, micro, and loot boxes can be used for good. I think that was the original intent as well, same thing with developers doing  updates to fix bugs. Now however games are released purposely broken since they will be able to patch it later. Will the gaming industry start to abuse early access games and crowd funding too??!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways what developers can do is 1st get rid of this taboo of having to always release games at the price of 60$. Everyone realizes due to inflation and production cost that games aren't that price anymore. People who wait for price drops are always going to wait for price drops. People who are early adopters will still drop the dough for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2nd, make things that normally wouldn't be in the base game part of a dlc. For fighting games like soul calibur, guest characters perfectly fit under this and characters who originally wouldn't be in the story line. Which to my understanding Tira is suppose to fit into the lateral, but there is still not that much known about SC6 right now. This is what I got from the official steam store page;\n\n&gt;\"STORY: Taking place in the 16th century, revisit the events of the very first SOULCALIBUR in Soul Chronicle mode.\"\n\nTo me this is a mistake and we need more details. Not only on their official social medias, but on all store fronts that this game is sold on. Then also explaining why a piece of dlc, is dlc. This helps get more positive feed back from consumers and I would imagine get more money as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to give one more last example of bad dlc vs good dlc from one of my favorite video games, ASURA'S WRATH. It was a really bad idea for capcom to cut off a piece of the ending and reselling it to you. It was a great idea to put asura vs ryu and asura vs akuma as dlc. It was clearly something that wasn't suppose to be apart of the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3rd, still give us the ability to unlock things within game. So please don't make everything paid content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4th, micro transactions are great for gamers who just want to speed their way through a game or make the game more enjoyable for themselves. Always include them without effecting the base grinding experience of the game. For people who don't want to pay for these micros. That should only be left up to games that are free to play. Because in this way, people have incentives to buy them. By doing this way all 3 parties win.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5th, I think the gaming industry have done a good job for monthly subs, expansions, and season passes. So no further comments on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6th, loot boxes should always be cosmetic. Nothing more and nothing less. So nothing game breaking \\*cough\\* \\*cough\\* (Star Wars Battlefront 2). Also, you don't have to make everything that is cosmetic in the game only available in loot boxes form. It is nice sometimes to just directly buy the product. Like imagined if blizzard put Overwatch League skins in loot boxes? That would be a disaster. Online TCG are very bad at this. They never give us a option to buy some of the cards directly like how you can in real life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR; Developers should release video games at their actual price, extra paid content should only be content that originally would not be in the base game, micros should not effect the grind of the base game unless it is free to play, loot boxes should always be cosmetic.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was thinking of a PvE environment where both options could coexist and be fun and viable.\n\nObviously realism here isn't an option. The only reason we even have melee weapons in games in the first place is the coolness factor, because a sword in a modern battlefield or army operation is all but useless. Ranged weapons (guns in this case) are just as or more deadly than melee weapons, with very few exceptions (i.e. knives in hand-to-hand combat).\n\nThis isn't even considering bows, that are more and more ignored altogether. In an ideal game, they could all coexist, but that game probably:\n\n* Makes melee and bow hits much more powerful than gun shots, with them being 1/2-shot to kill over a gun's almost DOT-like damage.\n\n* Has very long reload times for both ranged weapons\n\n* Treats bows like snipers\n\n* Gives shotguns very short range\n\nWhat I wanted was to figure out an alternate way to balance all of them without turning guns into a tickle-fest. Guns should still be deadly, but then what can swords do? Deflect projectiles? Make bows only for armor piercing?\n\nThese are tropes I don't find that fun, and I'd love a way for these weapons and builds to coexist in an alternate way that isn't \"just make the better ones weaker than real life\".\n\nAny ideas on this?",

But every time I research what games are out for it I end up talking myself out of buying it.\n\nReally, the big players are Zelda, Mario Odyssey, and Mario Kart 8, and even in Mario Kart 8 there has been criticism of the battle mode feeling like just another race. Monster Hunter might belong here.\n\nThe B-team on the bench is Splatoon 2, Mario Tennis... Arms... these are gimmicky and not particularly engaging.\n\nAfter that they have some incredible remakes selling at the price of AAA games (Crash Bandicoot, Donkey Kong, Rayman), which is just anti-consumer and lazy in my opinion.\n\nAnd at that point we have exhausted everything worth talking about hay they’ve managed to produce in 1.5 years+, and half of it was remakes.\n\nComing up... Pokemon was exciting until they said no random encounters. The jury is out on Super Smash, but I admit that I’m worried if they can underwhelm with key features in Pokemon and Mario Kart, Super Smash shouldn’t be taken as a guaranteed winner. Hopefully Mario Party is as well.\n\nAnd *everything* with the Switch is so expensive comparatively. I get that it’s because SD cards ain’t cheap and the tech in the controllers is bananas, but the games are $60 a year after release, and again, half are remakes or ported up from Wii U. So it comes down to a reality of spending $420 to play Zelda and Mario Kart, or $480 if I add in Mario Odyssey. That’s a lot to play three games on a complementary system.\n\nI **want** to buy a Switch but I can’t get over the prohibitive cost and the shallow bench of games. Am I wrong for expecting more 17 months after launch?\n\nEDIT: Responses here have been excellent, so thank you to everyone who is participating. I definitely don’t have the level of knowledge many here do, and I have misread a few things that folks here were kind enough to identify and clarify. I’m definitely encouraged and I expect to pull the trigger before too long. ",

It seems that games with true extra content are becoming more and more rare, and the only recent series that comes to my mind that offer this kind of content is the Souls series and Bloodborne.

Some of what it does is fairly impressive, but from a more \"modern\" perspective the game is somewhat ridiculous and has some bizarre design decisions.\n\nAfter playing games that are probably inspired by Shenmue (Yakuza), replaying Shenmue has similar feel. It feels like a Yakuza game, except they forgot to actually develop a \"game\". It's got a story, and a richly detailed setting, but there isn't really any gameplay to hold it all together. It's an elaborate time-wasting simulator except they forgot to give you ways to waste time. It's ostensibly a brawler, but you spend most your time waiting for stuff to open (there is no wait feature), and asking literally every NPC if they \"know any places where sailors like to hangout?\" (switch the audio to English for this section of the game—it is fucking hilarious).\n\nWhat is impressive (even to this day) is that you can ask every NPC about your current objective (some tell you fuck off though). They respond with 100 percent fully voiced lines. What is even more impressive is that if you are especially pigheaded and continue to ask them they'll usually have one or two more response telling you that, in fact, they do not know any places where sailors hangout. \n\nWhile impressive, from the perspective of 2018 it is completely bizarre. I remember it blowing my mind back in the year 2000. Now I wonder \"why did they bother?\". Extensive voice acting was new to me in 2000, so it was impressive at the time. Now it just seems like a massive waste of resources. Maybe I am jaded, but now I don't give a shit if I can ask Miki about sailor hangouts and have a fully-voiced response.\n\n\nI am pretty sure Shenmue pushed some boundaries at the time. However, some of what it accomplished seems just like a novelty—that it was done just for sake of doing it, rather than because it was good idea. I guess somebody had attempt whatever it is Shenmue was trying to do. I am enjoying my replay of it so far. I am looking forward to starting II, which is a little more polished. I am extremely excited for III. I imagine that almost 20 years of general development to field of gaming is going make a *huge* impact on formula—which other games like Yakuza have proved is generally solid.   ",

        "text": "Dark Souls is a series hailed for its amazing game design and satisfying challenge, but one has to ask, which game in the series is the best, objectively speaking?\n\nI believe it is Dark Souls 3 which is the best, and here's why. With the first game, challenge was the focus however it was often a frustration due to having limited healing resources and slow gameplay that many action gamers were not used to. Dark Souls 2 attempted to rectify the healing problem, but made the game less challenging and less fun as a result. Ironically while Dark Souls was too frustrating in its difficulty, Dark Souls 2 went in the complete opposite direction and made healing too lenient with life gems.\n\nDark Souls 3 fixed this problem. Healing starts off low with 3 estus charges but can be increased by exploring the world. Not to mention the combat is faster and more fluid. This means the players are rewarded for exploring and are actively encouraged to do so with the fast paced action oriented gameplay. No one wants to sit behind a shield all day. It's objectively boring. The difficulty here requires precise reactions which is more rewarding for the player, and when the player dies they can return to the action quickly with little downtime. The game is still hard unlike Dark Souls 2, but not punishing like the first game. This is one of many reasons why Dark Souls 3 is the best, objectively speaking.\n\n(By the way, Dark Souls is actually my favourite in the series, but I tried to be objective when analysing the games and concluded that 3 is superior)",

The game simply punishes you for not having good defense. And not reward you for having defense.\n\n&gt; Case Study 1: They are Billions\n\nThis is an interesting one. It encourages early exploration and rushing armies.

        "text": "Just finished Beyond Two Souls for first time on the PS4 Pro - I liked it, but it could have used better \"editing\" - the way it flowed from chapter to chapter, could have been a lot better if it was maybe made for this gen with faster loading capabilities to switch chapters quicker like a film - and allow more variety of scenes in a moment of gaming. \n\nWhat I mean by this is when it loads a level, you thoroughly spend a lot of time there, then it does a flashback level and you spend a lot of time there as well - it should have been maybe the flashback moments were in between a larger level. Because the way it is right now, most of the chapters feel fairly isolated from each other, with not much in-between, a series of vignettes. \n\nAnyways, I was wondering is there any footage of Ellen Page or Willem Dafoe watching or reacting to their in-game performances?\n\nDid they ever respond to the criticism of this game? Did they share thoughts on whether or not they'd do something like this again? At the time, IMO, those were some very big names to do a work like this, especially Ellen Page hot off of Inception just 2-3 years prior to Beyond. (PS: Inception came out 8 years ago - feel old yet?)\n\nAnyways I really liked their performances, and I loved Willem Dafoe in it it, though obviously he wasn't in it as much as Ellen Page - but god to me they did NOT phone it in, Willem Dafoe was great - his performance - to me - showed what the medium is capable of - I really liked how his face was animated.\n\nAnyways this game was super interesting - I think it would have benefited from being developed for PS4 - cause when I watch the behind the scenes of the mo-cap studio where Beyond was shot and where God of War , Uncharted 4 &amp; Death Stranding were/are shot - it seems like God of War , Uncharted 4 &amp; Death Stranding had a much larger more capable studio to shoot mo-cap scenes.\n\n\n",

        "text": "So read the warning, all good?\n\n[The game is this if you're wondering.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/555220/Detention/)\n\nAnyway, i want to post something i noticed about the game and see if other people agree.\n\nThis game uses a syncretism of 'Taoism' and Buddhist concepts heavily on the 'detention', and yet apparently most westerners (including me at first) expect everything to be spelled out and miss a lot. There are similarities and differences here between the 'Tao' and monotheist and even polytheist religions, but a important difference is that in the Tao, there is no omnipotent God - even the 'gods' were more like extensions of their roles, they do their job and that's it. \n\nSimilarly in Buddhism, people don't get condemned to hell, their karma, which is is a objective moral quantification of 'action driven by intention', takes care of that during reincarnation, but does not have a prime cause in 'God' setting what's moral (don't ask me how any of that is supposed to work either, i'm atheist). \n\nFor Ray's situation a important part is that gods *can't help her* to balance her karma. \n\nEven when she burns 'fake money' to ask for help she gets something to progress not a message of 'oh btw, you're completely in denial about something that isn't even completely true'. The judgment god for example can only respond 'yes, no, maybe' and is pretty much going 'you fucked up, stop torturing yourself about it', but of course has his limitations, witness how that shit never worked on previous cycles. [Meng Po](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Po) that is *supposed* to help souls forget their sins after 'enough' time in hell never once tries and only laments to old Wei in the 'good' ending that *Ray is damned forever*.\n\nThis is the first thing i want to point out. The good ending, if looked at by the authority figure - **isn't** - this is probably because of a unfortunate 'similarity' of syncretic Taoism with most religions - they view suicide very negatively.\n\nOriginally this wasn't something the 'religion' cared about but when it was mixed with hinduism (and its absurd quintillions years of hell for sinners) and karma, apparently there is a popular belief that a victim of suicide is naturally so obsessed with their problem and escape that their 'hell' is just a ritualized reformulation of the story and ends with suicide again, repeat forever. This is the main reason why the 'bridge' is down, that bridge and river is part of the folklore to cross to reincarnation.\n\nSo yeah, not a good look on the 'good' ending because even if Wei shakes her up from her guilt regarding him and mrs Yin deaths - she still killed Chong and is still obsessed about him and still killed herself and still represses *any* memory of the previous iterations.\nSo almost as depressing as the hanging ending in its way.\nedit: [reading another analysis](http://peterpaperwu.blogspot.com/2017/01/taiwanese-horror-game-detention_28.html), i finally remembered the 'yellowed airplane' on the good ending after she gets all the 'you are me' answers can represent forgiveness from Chong... it's possible that this is enough and the old goddess is mistaken at that time.\n\nThe second thing i wanted to ask/point out is, do people really think that the 'current iteration' of the game (bad ending or not) is not actually different from the 'forgotten ones'? It may end in the same way (in the bad ending) but it's obvious in several ways that Wei leaving journal pages is intruding a element of reality and doubt into the hellscape. \n\nFor instance, she killed herself before she could possibly have known that Wei was not killed - and in spite of evidence in the game, persists almost obnoxiously in the bad ending and previous events in ignoring subconscious clues against that belief. When she 'kills' young hanged Wei, she first states he's not breathing, then cuts his throat, then he opens his eyes and closes them. She several times receives diary pages from 'the future', and even sees 'ghostly' (real) older Wei just prior to both endings.\n\nClearly this cycle is different enough that she has a chance to burn up some of that karmic debt by meeting Wei. And that was simply impossible without 'real' things happening so, yes things are different. I like to believe that the 'popular culture' interpretation of suicide hell is pure bull in the game world and she eventually gets over Chong's death (pedophile bastard) but i'm still pretty mad at that useless old woman.\n\nOne thing i'm actually unsure about: is it metaphorical that she picks up the book list (the 'gun' in the inventory) from Chong's desk. Because if she did, there is little chance that she didn't know that it would get him in trouble, and considering her obsession it doesn't sound like her vibe even after he dumped her. \n (edit: the wiki mentions that young Wei gives it to her, add it to the 'misunderstandings' people get because of the non-literal hellscape soulscrew nature of the environment).",

Step by step, scene by scene. As if everyone there hadn't just played the game and were looking for discussion, OR they haven't played it and wanted to see if it was worth the time.

To add in filler for longer videos. But even then, it STILL feels like they're missing the concept of what a review actually is. Because if they wanted to expand the video, they could just actually discuss and review it for more than a minute or two, while dedicating 7 or 8 minutes to backstory, the release of the game, and the plot.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this?

        "text": "From what I gather, a lot of people on this subreddit are with less time to game compared to when they were younger (whether it be from a demanding job, being enrolled as a student, a significant other/children, or another reason). For this reason, I'm interested to hear what the last game was that you exceeded 200 hours in, how long ago this took place, and what captivated you to commit this much time to it. Was it last month? Last year? 5-10 years ago? Or have you never committed this much time to any single game? I picked 200 hours because I'm hopeful its enough time to make this a relatively uncommon event, which should facilitate interesting discussion. \n\nAnother observation I've made in gaming in today's age is that it seems more common to play more games, with less time committed per game. Taking this approach to gaming would theoretically allow one to experience more games given less spare time, which I think is something people prioritize more these days (thus ensuring they played all the \"great games\" of our generation - and maybe even past generations as well). If this behavior is representative of most gamers here, I think it makes it that much more interesting to hear about what games captivated people to play them for so long.\n\nAs for me:\n\nI exceeded my 200th hour in Battlefield One last month - a game that really blew away my expectations for how fun a multiplayer game can be. This is an uncommon feat for myself - the last game I exceeded 200 hours in would be Halo 3 back in 2010, which took place while I was still a teenager and had the free time to game for 20-30 hours a week. Since then, I've found it extremely hard to invest time into gaming, which is why I used to dabble in a lot of games that could be completed in less time. However, Battlefield One is the most fun I've had gaming in 8 years, and its made me realize that quantity over quality isn't always better.\n\nIn the past, I felt like I had to play all the games I'd missed out on playing from being too busy - I'd even make lists that I'd work through. I used to avoid multiplayer games for this reason (and also because I felt like I'd \"been there, done that\" by having played 1-2 titles in most popular FPS series, such as Battlefield and Call of Duty). At some point, I recognized what I was doing felt more like a chore - I felt obligated to finish every title on my list. In contrast, I'm having so much fun playing Battlefield One, I don't think I'll stop anytime soon - I don't really mind putting my limited free time for gaming into only one game given how much fun I'm having with it. Not feeling obligated to finish as many games as I possibly can is such a nice burden to be rid of.\n\nOf course, this is just my experience: I'm hoping others will have interesting stories to share!\n",

Now you're facing a completely different goal. Sometimes the previous goal vanishes and sometimes it's just delayed.\nHere's an example:\n\n[Spoiler for the new God of War]\nIn God of War (PS4) you're about to visit Jotunheim, the requirement is a special chisel you need to replicate the rune to Jotunheim. After that long quest you're about to create the rune in tyrs temple, where suddenly Modi one of Thors son's is ambushing you, in the end you're son is inflicted by a disease and while you were preparing for the journey to jotunheim all the time, you suddenly get completely throwed out of your course of action. \nFor the next hours your goal is to travel to helheim the land of the dead and finding a cure for your ill son.\n\nThe special thing about such scenes is that the player is getting told from the start what they will do in the next hours, what their destinations will be, such surprising events can completely subvert your expectations which is positive in my opinion so the pacing and course of the game is less predictable.\nAt the other hand, sometimes it can really caught you off guard especially when such scenes have no point of return for a while. In case of God of War I was prepared to do sidequests next, but the sudden circumstances won't allow me that, it's fine but in such scenes i'm not longer in control of the game pace.\n\nAnother more light example is the Mega Man X franchise, in later games while you are facing Mavericks at some point (to be honest always at the half) you're getting warped to a different stage and an different boss, without warning, some Intruder is attacking you or something other signifiant has happend. So now you're forced to do this \"intermission\" level before proceding the game. Most of the times these levels are rather short, but it leads to a slightly bit more game time and content than you initial thought.\n\nEdit: One example for games who have no (sudden) goal changes at all are mostly Bioware RPG's. For example games like Mass Effect or Dragon Age do never change or break up there structures. Their favourite progression structure is one clear goal and several arcs which you have to clear in a free to choose order to proceed further in the game (in the newer entries it's mostly the entire game, like gather all folks together and then beat the bad guys with combined forces) \n\nAre you fine with sudden goal changes? Or are they pissing you off because you have to change your mindset from one time after another. \n\nSomeone could say It's like working on a project and suddenly your superior comes to you and is forcing you to work on a completetly other ongoing project. It requires some adaption and can be demotivating because you're your previous goal not one single step closer.\n",

        "text": "This is in parts a response to the cluster of games journalism topics we had in\nthe last weeks. The focus of these was on how journalists review AAA games, and\nhow graphics and price politics of the publisher interact with the journalist.\nHowever I've been seeing a completely different side of games journalism.\n\nNamely what gets ignored.\n\nSo, La-Mulana 2 is out for 3 weeks now and has gotten a grand total of 6\nreviews on metacritic. Which is kinda to be expected because it's as niche as\nyou can get as a game. It was the same for Hollow Knight for example, it took\nalmost two months until it got a few more reviews. Reviewers are people too.\n\nBut the reviews it has are terrible. Four of those six aren't even in English,\nand one of the remaining ones has no bloody clue what the game is about. And\nwith that I still have to be glad that the game got enough attention to be\nassigned a metacritic score.\n\nThis is a recurring theme. Look at the metacritic page of The Cat Lady. 11 \nreviews, 4 Italian, 2 Greek, 2 German, 1 French, 1 Polish. The one\nEnglish language review is done by a Belgian guy for gamespot. Or Ghost 1.0: 7 \nreviews. 3 Italian, 1 Spanish, 1 Czech, 1 Russian, 1 English.\n\nOther games can amass a cult following and still be ignored. Zachtronics, the \nguy who invented the Minecraft engine, is an underground hit since SpaceChem.\nSince then his games have been almost aggressively ignored: \n\n* Infinifactory PC - 3 reviews, no metacritic score\n* TIS-100 - 3 reviews, no metacritic score\n* Shenzhen I/O - 3 reviews, no metacritic score\n* Opus Magnum - 4 reviews. Finally enough for an official score.\n\nAnd note: these are all good games with review scores higher than No Man's Sky.\n\nEven games of known publishers fall victim to this if they dare to make a game\nthat goes against established setting conventions. In 2011 Double Fine \npublished Costume Quest, an RPG about kids on Halloween. It has 2 metacritic reviews. A year later they\npublished Stacking, a fine little gem about puzzle solving by playing\nmatryoshka dolls. 9 reviews, 7 of them European.\n\nThe quintessence is: Whatever problems AAA games journalism has pales in\ncomparison to indie journalism. If you are either not American, or your game\ncaters to a niche, or even dares to try something new, prepare to be forgotten\nand ignored by the US publications. I'd chalk it up to market forces not \nrewarding these reviews, but that doesn't explain the coverage of European\npublications.\n\nI personally think this is a shame. English is the lingua franca of the\ninternet, but if you want to read about under the radar video games Italian\nseems to be your best choice. I invite the commenters to check this trend with \ntheir lesser known games. Also paging u/RagingDiedMe, the author of the last\ngaming journalism post.\n",

First and foremost, do you guys think they Are a good investment?\n\nA lot of the games I’d want to play are indie titles that are available on the PS store at this time, many of which also won’t be available physically for a while. I’ve been considering, if I stick with PlayStation as my main gaming system over PC, that I should try getting as many physical copies of indies that I can for my PS4/ Vita, so that if I end up getting tired of them I’d have the option to resell them. However, the flip side is that I’d be limiting myself to a single platform for these games when most digital indies allow for two.\n\nWith these factors In mind I can’t help but think, Is there a chance my digital purchases for indie games could carry over to next gen? Or, to raise another point, Is it even a good idea for me to purchase digital copies of games if they’ll be trapped to only one home console (and possibly carry over to my portable console as well)? Or am I just being reckless and should stick with AAA’s for Playstation and keep my indie purchases separate for laptop gaming? What are your feelings on this?",

Yay for small business enterprises! I've also been playing games for 3 decades now.\n\nAnd so part of me always likes it when games have freebies -- this part of me is the \"gamer\" or \"consumer,\" always focusing on the freebies I'd get and less costs or the need to purchase.\n\nThe other part of me is the businessman. Even though I only own a small business, I've also worked in other corporations and in the government in the past. This part of me \"the business guy\" also understands the need to find an influx of capital and cash. This part of me knows that plans need to be made to ensure that the business remains afloat and is profitable.\n\nAnd so in a particular case of early access games with a price tag (but with these games eventually becoming free-to-play later on) it's something I'm okay with. There are necessities to make those business decisions. What about you guys?",

During this phase, I feel like my mind disconnects from the game and I'm not fully present within the game world. My reflexes completely go for a toss, and I become slow and sluggish. And then my performance in the game suffers. \n\nAnd in a weird way I feel overwhelmed. So for example, if I was in the middle of map in Battlefield and there are opponents all around me, my mind gets overwhelmed because it doesn't know what focus point is should orient itself to. It's almost like its all too much for my brain to handle. Whereas in a more linear game like a racing game (even in online mode), my mind does not experience that because the goal is very simple....just overtake your opponent and go as fast as you can. The focus point is the other car that you are overtaking. \n\nIt's like online shooter games demand a high amount of concentration and my mind sometimes just wimps out and doesn't cooperate. \n\nAnd I'm not always like this, deep down inside I know how to play shooter games effectively. Whenever I go into an online match with full gusto and energy, I play really well. I've been the MVP in many Siege matches. \n\nSo what causes this brain fog? Is it boredom? Anxiety? ",

        "text": "I am currently developing a multiplayer subsim (submarines and stuff) and I find myself in conflict on certain gameplay aspects. To be precise, I am afraid my position is too radical and it will be of too much discomfort for a player, hence I'd like to hear a general public opinion on the subject.\n\n**Death notices reduce gameplay depth**. Death notices (aka kill feed) provides the offender with 100% precise, instant, always correct intelligence that strongly affects his further actions. Typical death notice contains:\n\n* killer identity - factually giving away an estimate of an attacker's position in case of local games (games with no across-the-map sniping). It removes tactical space for the attacker. Asymmetric teams can no longer conceal the presence of the strongest character in the locality, nor can they fake his presence by actually fielding a weak player in his stead. In case of MMO,  I'll take EvE-online as an example: your trail of blood can be followed in almost real time from the browser thanks to developer's API for killboards. Intel about your activity spreads to the whole world in the matter of minutes. Potential opponents that are hours away from you can learn about you and avoid you or hunt you down. And they are not going to hunt you if they're 99% sure they'll win. Free intel, that generally increases battle predictibility and therefore reduces battle frequency - players now fight less frequently and hate their time in the game more.\n* weapon - gives about everything you can want to know about attacker's tactical capabilities: his preferred combat range, style of battle, overall danger level. In case of CSGO or arena shooters, fallen player will recognize the weapon by the sound and looks of it, or it's firing patterns, therefore this information will leak inevitably, but in general: dead man does not talk. In MMOs this gives away attacker's build, giving the observers time to compose the counter force in case of games that fall into rock-paper-scissors-like mechanics class.\n* dead man identity - collapses tactical space for the victim side. No impersonation - identity and allegiance is revealed instantly. Mafia\\TITT-like games suffer from this.   \n\n1. No \"play dead\" is possible with death notices.   \n2. Sensory-obstructive mechanics (CSGO flash\\smoke, chaff\\jammers for simulator games) lose about half of their value because now you as an attacker are absolutely certain - if you spray in smoke and there is no death notice, I missed and should keep spraying. If there is - I can stop spraying and rush forward, ignoring the leftover half of the duration of smoke that would otherwise pin me down because of the risk of in-smoke ambush. This is very important for simulator games with developed sensor models. Uncertainty that is introduced by sensor imperfection is killed instantly in the moment of the kill, significantly altering the flow of the game in comparison to the imaginary game with no death notice.   \n3. Huge information leak even for arena shooters. Typical case - delayed blind rocket launcher kill in Quake, when the attacker that has launched the rocket 3 seconds ago is now 100 meters away and has no LOS to the place the frag happens. He is granted risk-free intelligence about his opponent death and subsequent weakness, and alters hist bunny-hopping plan for the next 30 seconds to accommodate this fact. All of this for free and because of death notices.\n\n**Death notices contribute to the meta convergence speed and make the game die faster**. Meta, or how I like to call it - knowledge, is accumulated by the player base with a pretty much the same method as we distill knowledge as a civilization. A scientific method. Gamers start with trial and error, then look at the stats to see what's working and what's not, build some mental or mathematical models of the game and test them, repeatedly, on and on and on, improving them to the infinity. Death notices significantly boost the initial trial-and-error phase, and statistics gathering phases. Like, exponentially. Successful attacker's build\\weapon\\stats\\methods are instantly made public knowledge. You can't keep secrets in modern competitive\\online games, and I think this is very, very bad. Online games with no secrets distill the meta too fast, and it requires considerable effort from both the developers (perpetual, constant patches and rebalances) and the community (guides, chill newbie tutorials) to keep the game alive. Reducing the speed of player's knowledge acquisition helps with reducing this strain and makes the game last longer with the same developer effort. Also, secrecy is cool.\n\n**Death notice comes hand-to-hand with other usual suspects.**   \n* TAB screen in CS-like games gives too much info. K\\D is vital intel, especially in pub match. Dead or alive is vital intel. Nickname is vital intel, although I admit it is not fun to fight nameless opponents.   \n* Connect\\disconnect\\online notifications. Dark Souls should not warn about the invasion. EvE online should not have had watch lists from the start (fixed now at last). This kills the initiative completely. So much god damn meta intel from nothing. What players do with intel? They turn it to their advantage in the most risk-averse form possible, avoiding disadvantageous situations at all costs, and then whine on the forums about it.   \n* Public match history with detailed statistics. MOBAs and e-sports are providing this. Now, this is complex matter. I'm not really sure that I don't like that, maybe this indeed is a good idea and provides the sense of admiration\\aspiration. But it's also lies perfectly in my \"meta convergence speed\" point, wich is why I'm not a fan.\n   \n   \n**What can be done?**   \nFor my subsim I was thinking about a couple of things:   \n1. No online\\offline\\joined\\left notifications.   \n2. Delayed kill notices, that are public, but are revealed in about half an hour after the event in not-ingame form. They do not contain the weapon or vessel that was used, only the killer and the victim name. Precise time is absent, only it's randomized estimation. If the player wants to consider someone dead, he needs to consult the sensors available to him and make the assumption.   \n3. Detailed history and statistics is available to the player himself, and he can choose to publish it, or conceal parts of it.   \n   \n   \n**What are you thoughts? Have you ever played games that did something like this? Was it frustrating? What could be done about it?**   \n\nAlso, here is an interesting review that was a fuel for my \"fog of war\" fire. It's a impression of a an umpire from a double-blind strategy card boad game. Paragraph \"2. Command, communication and intelligence related concepts\" is of interest, extremely appealing to me concept of information handling in multiplayer games. The whole review is generally a very good read IMO.\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1813031/test-time-four-year-old-review-le-vol-de-laigle",

I'm tired to see every PC enthousiasts sharing their beasty config or their fancy rigs and those subjects taking the highlights when it comes to PC. It reminds me a lot of the jackass who are proud to show their tuning cars. It's frankly ugly and quite cringy, in my opinion.  \n\nPC isn't about power, it's about the panel of choice it offers.\n\n* You don't like Xbox One controller ? You can play with - almost - every controller in existence without having to invest in a 80$ Chronus Max. \n* You don't like how Windows look by default ? You can customize it to great extent. \n* You don't like Windows ? You can ditch it for Ubuntu or any other Linux distribution.\n* You don't like Steam ? You can chose to support other platforms, like GOG, Origin, Battlenet, Discord... The situation would be even better if Steam had a real competitor.\n* You can - of course - chose your resolution, fps, anti-aliasing technique, to remove after effect like motion-blur, with or without V-Sync. \n* You can chose to support AMD, Nvidia or Intel.\n* You can even chose the API you want to run and support : Vulkan vs directx12 (or openGL vs dx11).  \n* You can any component you want : buy better fans, chose water-cooling, a better looking case, going small form factor...\n\nThere's just so much you can tweak, so much choices and imo, that's the greatest thing about PC. I would still play on PC, even if I have to drop the resolution to 720p because I can't upgrade my GPU for whatever reason, as long as I can feel like I'm free to chose my OS, components, the store I buy games on etc. \n\nUnfortunately, each time I see a discussion about PC (even from PC savvy persons), it's all about new graphics cards nobody will need or afford to buy, about how the new I7 is great for games... It's mostly about power and upgrades. I often heard about people that just want to build the best PC they can, even if it's just to play Dota 2, LOL or CSGO. Sure, everybody can do whatever he wants with his money, but it's still ridiculous. ",

In all Rockstars open world titles, (RDR, GTA, LA Noire), NPCs constantly comment positively on the player walking around in the world. People seem to feel this is immersive, but am I the only one that think this is a very awkward way of handling NPC interaction? The fact that every NPC seems to know who you are feels even more unrealistic to me than if they would just go about there business and not mention the player at all. Examples:\n\n* RDR: \"Theres that John Marston who shot and killed x\" or \"THATS JOHN MARSTON\"\n* LA Noire: \"Theres that cop that solved that case, at least hes handsome\"\n* GTA: The news radio constantly comments on everything you do and where you are in the story, making you feel like the center of the gameworld, even though it may be some insignificant mission. This is kind of cool, but it somehow makes me feel like I am the only thing that matters in the world, which somehow takes the immersion out of it?\n\nIdk I may be going out on a limb here, but does anyone else think its extremely awkward that in a open world, every NPC would know who the player is just by something that happens in the story? I mean dont get me wrong, I like NPC interacting dynamically with the player, but walking around in a world and every second NPCs know who I am and what I have done and comments on me, isnt that a little awkward? What makes it more awkward is these kind of one-liners that NPCs pull in Rockstar games often come from single NPCs. Why would a single person on a street start talking to themselves saying \"There is that brave detective, he is a handsome fellow\". Why would every NPC know who I am and what I have done?\n\nMaybe I am going in a weird direction with this, as I have not seen this discussed before. I somehow think Rockstar overdo NPCs reactions to the player, making it actually more unrealistic than if the NPCs would just talk about their stuff and never mention you?",

        "text": "I think it goes without saying that The Witcher 3's side guests are what the gaming industry should strive for: fascinating, well-written, adding to the lore and comprehension of the world, etc. \n\nThere's a *ridiculous* difference between: *\"Oh my son is sick, can you go grab me 10 Aloe plant please?\"* and *\"So there's a beast in town, can you kill it please? Oh and by the way there's another guy trying to kill it too so you better hurry. Oh and that guy is only trying to kill it so he can get information out of me, and once you're done he's gonna kill me and if you want to know why you have to keep doing this side quest.\"*\n\nWhich makes me think, **do you guys think it would be possible to design a game without a main quest and market it adequately?** \n\n----------\n\n**EDIT:** At this point, I want to point out that the goal wouldn't be to make a game without a main quest and with only side-quests - no matter how good they are - but it would be to design a game around having several main quests and no side-quests. **I'm not talking about designing a game purely with Radiant and Fetch quests, but with full-on narratives, twist, interesting characters and setting.**\n\n----------\n\nIf you take Witcher 3, imagine if the care that went into the main quest would have been distributed to make more and longer side-quests, *would you still have cared about the game?* \n\nYou're a Witcher, the premise is already there: your goal is to go from cities to cities taking contracts and helping people and *that's it*, but it's a game where each of theses contracts are so deep and rich that they feel like actually doing a main quest - they take many hours to finish and are done by doing multiple steps.\n\nIn other words, 50 really rich and interesting main quests, without side quests - vs the 1 main quests with a 100 bullshit side quests. \n\nWhat worries me about such an idea is that, I think by itself it would work: I would certainly be able to enjoy such a game given that it's done with talent - if it's a good game in and by itself, yeah sure why not? But the problem *is* with the playerbase, those who'd ask: *\"Okay but what's the point of the game? What do you do? You're a mercenary taking contracts, okay... but where's the conflict? What do you have to solve to *finish* the game?\"* Why do a game like No Man's Sky even need a main quest outside of the fact that it was clearly put there just to satisfy those questions? \n\nWhich to my mind... doesn't make that much sense, considering each quests would - theoretically - be designed to give you a satisfying sense of completion. Finishing Mass Effect isn't hindered by knowing there's a Mass Effect 2, for example. Mass Effect 2 doesn't suck up all the satisfaction of finishing Mass Effect 1. \n\nIf a game's quests have satisfying ending in themselves, do the game itself needs an ending? \n\nWhat do you guys think? Would it be possible or do games absolutely need a main quest? How would you market such a game so that people understand it?  \n",

I want to know some of the games released in 2018 which have new game+ with cheat weapons or op weapons like resident evil series or cheats like gta games, does anyone of you know a game that is released in 2018 with such mechanics?\n\nWhat do you think about single player cheats? What are your funniest moments with cheats? Do you miss cheat modes?\"\n\nWhat I mean by cheat codes or cheat modes (for users who do not know about cheats or cheat codes in SP games)--\n\nI mean single player video games cheat modes or cheat codes which contain cheats like god mode,infinite ammo etc or overpowered weapons which are kind of similar to cheats. Cheats in the sense that objects or in game aspects which give the player or user an advantage or full control over some of the aspects of the game. For example god mode gives the player infinite health which means that enemies will not be able to damage the player or infinite ammo which basically means the player never runs out of ammo in shooting games etc. Cheats also encompasses big head mode, specific item spawning etc. I am trying to encourage discussion on the topic of cheats because such discussion could encourage a game developer(if he reads the thread of course or reads the comments) to make games which have cheats to make players feel overpowered. Cheats work as a bonus. They are very easy to add in any game because they do not need any balancing (other than keeping the numbers of the game in mind so that the game does not crash when activating any cheat) .\n\nEdit: Some people have taken this thread out of context. When I say cheat codes or cheat modes, I consider cheats as a bonus or something funny or mindless. I never meant that cheats are a means of progression or anything. It is simply a cheap bonus to add in your game so that players can have some fun.\n\n(well of course if anyone uses cheats to progress in the game,it is none of my business. Good for him/her if he enjoys using cheats or something)  ",

        "text": "Hi there!\n\nI hope your day is going well.\n\nSo, anyone here into Armored Core, maybe Ogre Battle, or just a lover of all manner of games that never ever got to see the light of day?\n\nI know I sure am. Quite frankly, a while ago it occurred to me that almost every dang thing I loved was either a complete nonstarter, or got screwed over by some bizarre circumstances out of anyone's control.\n\nA good example: The aforementioned Ogre Battle.\n\nThis is a series that defined a lot of the norms of the SRPG genre, one that eventually gave birth to the awesomeness that was Final Fantasy Tactics. However, due to a translation being delayed, FFT actually more or less killed the series in the west. In fact, it's been assumed to be dead here by the JP folks so much that they never even let us have the digital re-releases.\n            \nWhy? Well, FFT hit the west and blew peoples' minds. However, they didn't know that it was actually originally supposed to be the sequel to Tactics Ogre, LUCT, or Wheel of Fate, depending on the region. It's basically like if You mashed Game of Thrones and FFT into one, and made it surprisingly believable. \n                 \nPoint being, it was a dang masterpiece, and the suits saw this. So, they told him to take the sequel that was planned (Ogre Battle and Tactics Ogre are different sides of the same series, by the way), and turn it into a FF game.\n                    \nThing is, the SNES version of that game never made it to the west, and fans of the original March of the Black Queen wanted to see more of that universe.\n                      \nWell....the translation got delayed, it came out after FFT, and people assumed it was a knock off, killing it's chances of getting a fair shot (It actually had a ton more in it than FFT, funnily enough).\n                     \nAlright, but then they remade it on the PSP, surely this time it got it's due, right? Well....kinda. It sold decently, but many fans ended up dropping it before the end because of a strange decision from the higher ups to demand that some balance changes needed to be made exactly like in FF11. Bear in mind a lot of these made NO sense whatsoever, like the chance for crafting to fail obnoxiously often for required and tedious things...when there's a system to save anywhere. The weapons were weirdly balanced, and there was just way too much MMO-esque meta gaming when it game to end game. Most people dropped it way before end game, and that was just tragic, since the setting, writing, and presentation were top friggin notch.\n           \nWell, thankfully an amazing modder stepped in, and created a mod called One Vision, which fixed the ever-loving christ out of that game, into what is now easily one of the best SRPG experiences out there, and it's not even at 1.0 yet. Dude's a legend.\n\n                      \nPreposterously niche enough for ya?\n\n              \n             Well, what about Armored Core?\n\n             \nYou'd think a 20 year long series by the same people, and using the same mechanics to some degree of Dark Souls would have been given a shot here.\n\n             \nWell, they did...kind of. Many people played the PS1 game, many played 2, and For Answer. Most people never played the 11 other games in the series.\n\n                Why?\n\n                 \nWell, a number of reasons. For one, the only ones that sold are the one they actually bothered to advertise. Despite being an absurdly long series, even some of the best entries in the series were lucky to even get commercials. \n\n             \nFor another, the fans had a bad habit of doing exactly what Dark Souls fans do. They would take the hardest game of the series, show it to their friends, and say \"look how hardcore I am\", instead of giving one of the better starting points, and showing off all the cool and crazy mechanics in play here.\n\nWe're talking about a series about giant, fully customizeable war mechs that often fight moving robotic cities, massive AI armies, and even has a sense of humor, but never sold worth a crap.\n\n          \nPoint being, if You like discussing this absurdly specific stuff, I would like to let You know that I've been working on a site for all of those high quality, but low sales situations out there, and am always looking for more feedback.\n\nSo, if this sounds like Your kind of thing, drop on by!\n\nhttp://www.niche-games.com\n\nSincerely,\nCoffee Potato, loving purveyor of the digital junkyard",

        "text": "This thought hits me sometimes.  I realize that I can close my eyes and play through the entirety of MGS 1 in my head.  I feel like I know almost every crevice of that game, where the items are, what story beats happen there, without having played in years.  But I played MGS4 much more recently, and I can't \"pick out\" a single distinct area from it (except Act 4).\n\nSame with Mario 64 and OoT, I know that I know every inch of those games back to front, but the most recent version I've played (I don't have a Switch), Galaxy 1 and 2, and Skyward Sword, just don't \"stick\" in my head.  I don't know if I could pick out the Gusty Gardens world more than the Bumblebee world, but I could write a doctoral thesis on the difference between Cool Cool Mountain and Snowman's Land.\n\nIt's something intangible, but it feels to me like game areas in that time period just had something special to them.  Like [take this painting of an area from Chrono Trigger](https://imgur.com/l22FW).  Everyone I know who's played Chrono Trigger **knows** that area, where you're climbing up on the right side of the screen and see the chest on the left across the river.  Hell, it's famous enough that someone decided to make that painting.  Why does something like that just stick with us, and it seems it's stopped happening?\n\nThe easy answer is that it's just nostalgia.  We were all young in the 90's and played the games to death.  Now we're older and we can't *get into* games like we used to.  So things like iconic level design don't stick with us like they used to.  That may be partially true.  Back in the day, a sprite that came on screen that was bigger than a sprite was supposed to be, or did something that a sprite shouldn't do, was enough to stick with you or scare you.\n\nSo does that mean games still have this quality and kids playing them today will have the same iconic areas and scenes?  Maybe I seem grumpy but I just can't imagine that in 20 years a someone will paint a watercolor like that Chrono Trigger image about an iconic level in Skylanders or LEGO Star Wars or something.  There seems to be a je ne sais quoi about level design from that time period that sticks with me and people like us on this subreddit that eludes me.  What do you guys think?",

It’s about Destiny players celebrating Gjallarhorn Day.\n\nSay what you will about the game, and I know folks have their own opinions or heard stuff all over the internet about it... that’s neither here nor there. The idea is simply celebrating something momentous or surprising in the games that we play.\n\nIn the case of Gjallarhorn Day, it was the moment when an NPC (Xur) sold a weapon once again. A weapon that was so spectacularly amazing that it changed the landscape of the game’s PvE content. There are probably some of you who’ve seen players who had genuine reactions of shock and surprise (and hyperventilation) when they had a Gjallarhorn drop in the wild, or when Xur sold it again.\n\n———\n\nWhat I’d like to know is:\n\n**What is your Gjallarhorn Moment?**\n\nBy this, whether we wanted it or not... ahem... whether you played Destiny or not, was there a particular moment in any game when you finally obtained an item — a weapon, an armor, an artifact — something you always wanted with like perfect rolls and all that. A moment that you have waited a long time for, and seeing it come to fruition.\n\nWhat was that moment? Item? Situation?\n\nThanks for joining the discussion.",

These games also have a high learning curve and require tons of practice, working through adversity and stress and making lots of mistakes, but the punishing factors that are not in your favour are often way better than you and more advantagous to the point that it feels like you are either lucky that you manage to win or persist, or makes you feel that you really worked hard to progress just a little further and definetely feel like you earned it",

        "text": "One of my most powerful emotion-related early gaming memories come from the time I would play Counter-Strike as a kid, in a dingy Ukrainian gaming cafe. I would experience a profound little freak-out when I switched to free-look while spectating and zoomed around the map. When you go out past the playable area, the world stops rendering properly, and begins to do that weird repetition of the edge of the geometry effect (kinda like moving around a window on the screen of a crashed computer) on a background of a black void that is the outside of the map. \n\nThat would always elicit this deeply, intense, uncanny feeling, to the point that I would avoid having that happen when examining the map. To this day, whenever something like that happens in a game, it always kinda freaks me out in the back of my mind. \n\nI suspect it has something to do with the \"immersion,\" with tricking my spatial mind into processing the game world as \"the real world,\" and then having that illusion be suddenly broken in an unaesthetically trippy way. The cognitive dissonance of it. It's feels like becoming aware of The Simulation, not that I believe in that theory.\n\nAnother example is deep water in a game - it is usually rendered as very dark; think oceans in Skyrim or even pubg. I hate being underwater in a game because whenever I see the dim sea surface fade into a formless darkness, that primal part of me is stirred up into an irrational panic. Somehow, staring into that void induces pure existential dread. Just extremely uncomfortable. \n\nHowever, when out-of-map but without any trippy glitching, I always feel a strange, slightly trippy but very peaceful feeling. Usually the background art of the level envelopes the entire space, giving you a vast, ghostlike feeling as you walk on nothing over a beautiful, huge space, the bits of the slowly receding fragmented geometry giving you perspective of the scale. I'm thinking of being out of the Covenant in Halo 3, which looks amazing.\n\nIt's really fascinating to me, experiencing this. The 3D game space is a pretty weird thing, this infinite void that, technically, in a weird way, exists, since \"virtual\" is not separate from reality. And the way our minds \"interface\" with it is just too trippy.\n\n\nIf you're still here, express/discuss anything, and let me know if you've felt something similar.\nAlso sorry for the \"overuse\" of \"quotes\" for \"poetic effect\"",

Jumping into a match is essentially flipping a coin to see if you're on the team that will get steam rolled or not. It doesn't matter how good *you* are. If you're on the wrong team, you're just going to die over and over.\n\nStatistics is a thing. Data science is a thing. Machine learning is a thing. There's absolutely no reason for match-making to be this broken. Track player stats and build teams so the odds are 50/50.\n\nKeep lifetime and recent player stats (say past 5 hours of play). K/D ratio, Accuracy, Assists, etc. Right now teams are stacked only to have equal player counts. Instead the game should balance several variables, like equal cumulative K/D ratios.\n\nKeep stats individually for each class. If someone is great at playing Assault but has been playing Sniper for the past 40 minutes, update their team's chance of winning according to the player's performance as Sniper.\n\nIf one team is significantly behind the other, add new players to the losing team even if it gives them more total players.\n\nSwitch players between teams if no new players are joining. People will be annoyed if they fought well for one team, got switched to the other, then lost. But having consistently balanced teams is way, *way* more important than finishing a round on team \"Blue\" because that's what you started as.\n\nMultiplayer games have consistently, severely unbalanced teams; this breaks the game. Auto team-balancing should be stronger, and use methods from data science and machine learning. It doesn't matter if the balancing is occasionally disruptive to individual players, because unbalanced teams are consistently *more* disruptive to *all* players.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

It was an awesome experience, as my dad is very hands-on with things and used to build computers a long, long time ago, and I just wanted to spend some father-son time with my dad. It was an awesome feeling when we hit the power button and the PC booted up first time with no issues. The thing runs great, the hardware is incredible, and the games, on a technical standpoint, run even better. The PC kicks ass, to say the least. Around this time, I was also gifted an Xbox One S. Having owned an OG Xbox and a 360 (both Pro and Slim versions) with still a lot of games from them, the nostalgia kicked in and I've a blast playing that thing. All I did was the plug the thing in, log into my account, and downloaded/starting playing games. \n\nSounds all good right? I have both (because really, why choose?). Here's my issue: to some extent, I really do feel like a certain amount of choice goes into one or the other. For example, I could either upgrade to an SSD, upgrade my monitor to one capable of 144Hz, or I could upgrade my Xbox to an X, purchase a years worth of Gold, etc. I'm 23, and while my life and career is starting to move up, I am by no means wealthy, and soon will be paying a lot in bills (finally becoming an adult...at 23...). So although I have both, I feel like it would make sense practically to invest in one or the other and that's the hard part. While my PC runs better now than my Xbox with online play not requiring a subscription, I really don't care about the tech behind it. I'm not really into computers as much as I'm just into the games, so if something goes wrong with my PC, I really don't want to diagnose it. Some people I know really enjoy troubleshooting, SOLVING the problem and fixing it, but not me. I have enough 'work' with my career path that I really don't want that stress with gaming. It's a personal thing sure, but it's who I am. On the other hand, Xbox doesn't allow for the freedom a PC has, and because I have a PC that my dad built and essentially bought, I feel guilty not using it.\n\nI don't know if anyone else knows what I'm going through. I hope I elaborated clearly enough and apologize in advance in something is confusing. I will try and explain anything unclear in the comments. Thank you.\n",

Eh... the new game plus in dark souls and borderlands series feels like a new game rather than a new game plus.\n\nThe reason I am asking this is because, Doom games are kind of power fantasy games where your character is strong af (roughly similar to prototype games) and you are destroying your enemies. If we get cheat menu and new game plus that would be a great bonus imo.\n\nSo what do you think folks? I think we should request for cheat mode at least...... it will be fun.",

        "text": "Hitman feels like an assassin’s playground. It gives you several locations to explore and visit. Many developers and publishers like to throw out the buzz word “sandbox” as a means to show how open and varied their game is. While many games do have variety, I do not think they really are a sandbox. I feel this word is used a lot because it has a positive meaning within the game’s industry. But with Hitman, it really is a sandbox. The creativity with a sandbox is that ideally, you have this one space that you can basically do whatever you want in. And depending on the tools you have, you can continually manipulate that space into something new. This is a great way to describe how Hitman approaches its level design and gameplay. For the most part Hitman 2016 delivers on this with providing a good amount of levels that act as these mini open worlds that have their own buildings to explore, events happening within the area, and people going about their lives.\n\nThe environments within this series and this game do a great job of feeling like real places. Your target will have his or hers daily routine and will be moving about the level doing many things. If you learn their routine, you can exploit this to provide you an opportunity. But the civilians, guards, and law enforcement within the level also have their own routines. A shop owner may be attending to customers and you need something from their shop to assist you to proceed to your vantage point or get closer to your target. Random people may become suspicious by your actions if you’re doing something odd like climbing a building from the outside. They may run and alert the guard or the police which could cause unwanted attention. A small and great detail within the game is if you drop a gun and a civilian finds the weapon, they will alert a guard or law enforcement member of the firearm. The small things the AI pays attention to within the environments help sell the levels as places and locations rather than a big space where you need to kill someone in.\n\nHitman’s mostly mandatory internet connection is an area of the game that I do find to be at odds with everything else, especially with how you unlock items. The game allows you to play the game while offline or online. You can only earn challenges while playing the game online. But you can take what you have earned while online and use it offline but you cannot earn anything offline. This is an odd choice as this is a single player only game. I dislike mandatory online connections but I can understand the use of them with MMOs and other games like The Division of Destiny. This is one area that I hope gets patched out as the online and offline issue effects the save system as server issues can cause you not to be able to load your saves that you made while connected to the internet. This should not be in the game and really goes against the freedom that this game otherwise presents.\n\nHitman has always been one of those series that I loved and grew up with. I really love that the same voice actor for Agent 47 has continued to do the voice work for each game. His voice is iconic and completely fits his character that if anyone else did him it wouldn’t feel right. I have high hopes for season 2. Though I did like the potential of continually building on this model, I do like that Hitman 2 is releasing as a full game rather than as an episodic structure. I would love if they remade some older levels from Hitman 1 – 4 and released them as free content updates to their new game. Either way, Hitman 2016 is a great experience with some odd choices in relation to its internet connection but if you want to brush up on your hitman before the sequel this fall, then this will most definitely be worth your time.\n\nLink: https://youtu.be/sEiEidJqSLI\n ",

A real van would tip at mild speeds (50 MPH sometimes slower).\n\n+ Triple-A titles (Watch Dogs 2) where it is impossible to even spin out a car's back end -- at any speed.\n\n+ Ridiculously cartoonish physics in passenger planes. (GTA, Just Cause 3, etc)\n\n+ No bullet flight times.  Not even on sniper rifles.\n\n+ No bullet drop. Not even when sniping from large distances.\n\n+ Human characters , police, NPCS, instantly dying by being shot in the foot with a handgun.\n\n+ It is never really dark outside even in the middle of the night in these games. The real world is  pitch-black dark at night.  Why aren't we giving the character some night-vision goggles?\n\nI will never complain if the mere technology of video game consoles and PCs is the limiting factor in calculating the physical interactions of cars and bullets. No complaints there. (I won't demand a full turbulence solution of wind drag against a truck trailer on a highway)  But when this is done intentionally,  particularly with your triple-A studios,  I simply cannot understand why this is happening.   Why would you waste your time writing software to subvert laws of physics which are already taken care of by the existing physics engines out-of-the-box?  \n\nAirplane physics requires that some speed is built up to maintain lift. This means dives have to be coordinated to increase speed.   Games are played on flat 2D screens, which is makes it difficult to determine how far the plane is tilted backwards or forwards against the ground. This is exacerbated by the fact that the camera viewpoint is hovering outside the plane. And yet there is no indicator on the screen anywhere regarding the tilt of the plane. Not even a horizon indicator.  This is pitiful. \n\nI am completely turned off by these silly , unphysical unrealistic design decisions that were intentionally programmed in by (allegedly) professional game devs.  If the technology holds you back that's fine, I won't complain. But why are you hoisting this silly cartoonishness on me on purpose?  If I wanted to play a cartoon, I would fire up Stardew Valley and grow magic plants.\n\nIn this thread you will try to explain to me why you would EVER intentionally write software to subvert realism, when the machine you are developing on can easily and fluidly simulate the real physics. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "A while ago I wrote a post, \"How JRPGs and CRPGs can learn from each other\".  But there's one hybrid of the styles that I'm particularly interested in.\n\n\nTraditionally, CRPGs (or WRPGs) have treated the entire party as the player.  You control your party of created characters, who interact with the world as a unit, talking to NPCs, quest givers, story characters, etc.\n\n\nEven in more recent games like Pillars 1/2, Divinity OS 2, Bioware games, etc, the vast majority of the writing goes into 1v1 interaction between your main character and the rest of the world (including recruitable companions.)  Very little writing goes to party members interacting with each other, or as a group.  Just little comments here and there.\n\n\nContrast with most JRPGs, where a large chunk of the writing and story is devoted to the main party members and how they interact together as a group. (eg. the main story in Persona 3/4/5, the skits in Tales Of games, how Grandia has everyone sit together for a meal and a chat every evening, etc.)\n\n\nAlso, it's not just about the structure and the writing, but also the amount of content devoted to the party members - JRPGs have full portraits for each character, with many facial expressions and body language.  WRPGs tend just to have a small, static image, or in the case of bigger budget games like Bioware or Witcher, generic procedural facial expressions.\n\n\nI'd really love to see a game that focuses on a linear story with the party members as key characters who interact with each other as a group (like JRPGs) but with WRPGs' more simulationist combat and more mature settings and writing.  And a western art style.  (Although I do like anime, it would be very interesting to have a JRPG structure with a classic fantasy art style.)\n\n\n",

They later admitted that they didn't know where to take Mega Man at the time thanks to Inafune's departure (and eventual crash and burn).\n* Sega hired Taxman and Stealth to develop several remasters of the original Sonic games for mobile (only one of which, CD, has somehow made it to console as well), then had them make Sonic Mania. This followed the failure of their Sonic 4 project and the generally poor reputation of modern Sonic games.\n* Konami offered the fan who made an unofficial remake of the Silent Hills demo PT an internship, but only after Konami's reputation has gone down the toilet in regards to their treatment of their employees and apparent love of pachinko.\n\nAnd then there's Nintendo and Metroid. They infamously took down AM2R when their PR in regards to handling Metroid was in the crapper at the time, and eventually took the warpath against fangames following that. But they didn't hire DoctorM64 following that at all; they announced their own remake of Metroid II and insisted that they had been developing it this whole time.\n\nOriginally I thought that it was a reflection of Nintendo's stubbornness, but looking at these instances of fangame creators being hired, they really were following normal gaming company behavior. All of these different companies had bad reputation at the time for different reasons, and clearly Nintendo wasn't ready to admit defeat during the AM2R fiasco.\n\nSo why can't companies hire fangame developers when their repuation isn't poor? It certainly would be a sign of goodwill towards the fans that would enhance their reputation when it's already good. Is there a drawback to hiring fangame developers during \"fat years\" that I'm not aware about?",
