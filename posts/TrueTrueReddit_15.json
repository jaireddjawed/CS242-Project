        "text": "There are two pastries in the Jewish religion that have traditionally used human flesh as an ingredient.\n\nFirst, the Hamentashen. Jewish children learn that the triangular pastry is a replica of the triangular hat worn by Hamen, the arch enemy of the Jewish people. The truth is that the pastry is actually meant to look like Hamen's ear, not his hat. These pastries are filled with poppi seeds, apricots, chocolates, and other sweeets, but many Jews throughout history also filled these pastries with the flesh, fat, and blood of local gentile children kidnapped and murdered in a ritual sacrifice of revenge. \n\nThis practice continues today, and often involves the use of aborted fetuses supplied to Jewish bakers from organizations like Planned Parenthood. This is why so many Jews are pro-choice and donate money to PP.\n\nSecond, the Afikomen. This special matzah is hidden during the Passover Seder. It is a fun game for children to seek out and find the hidden piece of unlevened bread, return it to their father for a reward, and then everyone eats it for dessert. All fun and games, right?\n\nNo. This is symbolic of the tenth plague: The slaying of the first born. Jews teach their children that \"God\" killed the Egyptian pharoah's first born as a punishment for not releasing the slaves. This is not entirely true. Jews also teach that God works through the actions of men. The Israelites were the real perpetrators of the mass killing of all Egyptian children.\n\nThis includes Egyptian children born to women in Jews' own homes. Most slave familes of that era had at least one child in their household fathered by the Egyptians. This is symbolized by the vacant seat at the seder table, the plate of uneaten food, and the feigned ignorance of the wherabouts of it's intended occupant, \"Elijiah.\"\n\nWhat's the truth? The male Jewish head of household murdered his stepson, baked his flesh into the matzoh, put his blood into the 4 cups of red wine drank at the seder, and rejoiced in the murder of the innocent child of the Pharoah. The children are being trained at an early age to hunt down non-Jewish children to be slaughtered and eaten.\n\nMany Jews still use human flesh in pastries for Passover. They are not widely distributed, but certain Rabbis continue the practice. During a Seder at a Hasidic congregation in Chicago, I followed a rabbi into the kitchen and stole a bit of his pastry. It was much different than a traditional matzah. It looked more like a hunk of halavah. I took it and ate it. He yelled at me not to. I asked him, \"Is this what I think it is?\" He told me yes and scolded me. The next few days I experienced a mild psychedelic experience and a rather substantial period of enlightenment. \n\nJews throught history have been notoriously cannibalistic. They still are today. Killing the children of their oppressors and eating them was the Jewish path to freedom. They have continued the tradition, and continue to rule the world through lies and usury to this day.\n\nI was a victim of this practice. I was adopted by a Jewish family. While I was raised Jewish, I was also badly abused. In addition to daily torture, I was given allergy shots as a way for my body to produce antibodies and hormones, and then my blood was drained from my body and consumed by my mother, who is a longtime student and practitioner of occult witchcraft.\n\nI know this sounds hard to believe, but it is true. While blood consumption is not kosher, human flesh has always been kosher. Crazy, I know. Sometimes the truth is a hard pill to swallow.\n\nIf humanity is ever going to overcome the tyrrany of Jewish brainwashing, usury, and enslavement, the good men and women of this world are going to have to learn to beat them at their own game. \n\nIt's time for these pieces of shit to get the fuck off the planet.",
