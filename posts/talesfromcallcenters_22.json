        "text": "Hi there, small, adorable, stupid story about a customer.\n\n\nLittle backround, I work(ed) as a customer service (tech support) guy at a call center, per standard we would have the customer tell us two details about their info to verify them. One of which was their birthdate. \n\n\nSo I get a call from a lady that has some kind of \"my phone is not working\" issue. Per usual I try to verify her. Me is Me, Lady is Lady.\n\n\nMe: \"Can I please have your birthdate and the last 4 digits of your bank account number for verification?\"\n\n\nLady: \"Well my bank account number is ...\" *proceeds to tell whole bank account number*\n\n\nMe: \"Ok I only needed the last 4 digits but it checks out. I still need your birthdate.\"\n\n\nAt this point I have to add that we were closely controlled, there were constantly people listening in and nitpicking issues like not verifying customers properly. So I was consistent.\n\n\n\nLady: \"I won't tell you my birthdate! *chuckles* It's actually kind of rude to ask an old lady like me!\"\n\n\nShe was about 50 or something.\n\n\nMe: \"I need you to tell me your birthdate to verify you as our customer, otherwise I can't help you.\"\n\n\nLady: \"But why would you want to know my birthdate?\"\n\n\nMe: \"I have it here in your info, I know what it is, I need you to tell me what it is, so I can make sure this is you calling so that we can talk about your file.\"\n\n\nLady: *chuckles* \"I don't want anyone to know my birthdate, I'm a Lady!\"\n\n\nThis went on for a few minutes, I made it very clear that it was necessary for her to say her birthdate. She did not do it, chuckled all the time and in the end we ended the call. I told her she could maybe get help at a local store or something. She was ok with it. Weird one.",

Me is me, UI is unprofessional interpreter. \n\nUI: Hello I'm your Spanish interpreter. Is this going to take long because I'm almost off? \n\nMe: I have no idea how long this will take. I don't know what the patient needs yet. \n\nUI: Okay well I've got a timer set to go off when my shift is up so I'll just say I have to go if my timer rings before we're done. Conference me in. \n\nMe: [hoping this lady was kidding and conferences the call]\n\nCall goes fairly normally. Just an appointment cancellation but from the conversational Spanish I could pick up, the interpreter was definitely trying to rush the patient along and sounded pretty impatient when the patient had to look up any information we needed and again when I had to confirm a few extra pieces of information that we have to check every few months or so. Call is just about wrapped up but I still had to confirm the appointment information when I hear the interpreter's timer go off. \n\nUI: Thank you call center. You'll have to continue this call without me because I'm off now. *click*\n\nI didn't want to get another interpreter on the line just to confirm the appointment and then say goodbyes so patient and I muddled through it and ended the call. Who does that? I don't get to hang up in patients when they take me over the end of my shift. \n",

        "text": "TL;DR: Call centre agents usually know their job better than you do.\n\n \n\nQuick background: I work for Canadian telecommunications giant (\"Blue\") as a L2 tech agent. \"Repeat\" customers come through to my queue directly, \"first time caller\" customers go to Care/Tech/L1.\n\n \n\nThe Cast:\n\n$Me - your plucky protagonist\n\n$AM - Angry man\n\n\n This is (obviously) not a direct transcript, as the actual call took over 20 minutes, including about 4 minutes of hold time. Assume every line and response is repeated about 6 times, and you will get an idea of how the call went.\n\n\n &lt;BEEP&gt;\n\n\n &gt;$Me: &lt;Generic opening spiel, including the words \"TECHNICAL SUPPORT\"&gt;\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: Put me through to a supervisor!\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: Certainly sir. Can I ask the reason you need a supervisor, in order to get your issue resolved?\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: Yes! I have been told by two different agents that they would not help me!\n\n \n\nQuick check of the notes on the file that automatically opened. Two of my L2 colleagues (same site!) have already been in the account, and left notes that the caller wished to speak with a supervisor, but would provide no additional information. As policy we do transfer customers to a manager on request, divided into Customer Care for billing/policy disputes/agent complaints, and Tech for, well, \"Tech\" complaints (basically yelling about network outages).\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: I'm very sorry to hear that, but I would be happy to transfer you to one of our billing managers to assist you with your complaint. Please hold the ...\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: No! I want to speak to YOUR manager!\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: OK sir, but my manager is not the other agents' manager &lt;lie&gt;, and so, one of our Customer Care managers would actually ...\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: No! I want to speak to YOUR manager!\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: My manager is a manager of technical agents, and your stated concerns would be better adressed by our Customer Care team ...\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: Don't put words in my mouth. I need technical help! I want to speak with your manager immediately!\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: If it's a technical issue sir, I am MORE than qualified to assist you. What seems to ...\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: NO! I WILL speak with YOUR supervisor!\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: Well sir, as a Tech agent, I am actually more qualified to assist you than my manager is, as I take these calls day-in, day-out. What is your technical prob ... ?\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: I am not going to speak to you any more! You are refusing to assist me! Put me through to YOUR manager right now!\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: O...k. What is it you need *my* specific manager for?\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: I want to be connected to someone polite and knowledgable!\n\n \n\nO_o\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: Hold one moment please.\n\n \n\nPuts customer on hold. Search for supervisor. See supervisor in management meeting. Aw yiss.\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: I'm sorry for the delay, but my direct supervisor is in a meeting right now, and is not available to take your call. I could still get you to a Customer Care manager to address those concerns?\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: Thats unacceptable!\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: &lt;Wut?&gt; I'm sorry? I don't understand.\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: Your manager should be available to take calls!\n\n \n\nOk. The Crazytown train has officially departed.\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: No sir, my job is to take calls. My manager's job is to manage me. I am happy to get her to call you back once she is available, which should be around &lt;next o'clock&gt;.\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: So you're saying that her time is more important than mine is??\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: &lt;YES!&gt; Not at all sir. I'm saying that she is currently unavailable, and will call you back at &lt;next o'clock&gt;.\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: But that's what you're saying!\n\n \n\nRinse and repeat for 5 minutes.\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: What is your name??\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: Urashk. U. R. A. S. H. K.\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: And your location??\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: Due to security reasons, I will not be providing you with that information.\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: What do you mean?? Do you think I am going to blow up every building in &lt;major Canadian city&gt;??\n\n \n\n&gt;$Me: Again, sir, we do not release specific location information due to security concerns.\n\n \n\nCue five minute rant about how he is intelligent, and we need to treat him with respect, ending with:\n\n \n\n&gt;$AM: Stop treating me like an idiot! I don't talk to idiots!\n\n \n\nSnap.\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Neither do I. Have a nice day. &lt;Release button&gt;\n\n \n\n&lt;Click&gt;\n\n \n\nSo I *did* provide the customer's info to my direct supervisor for a callback, and she *did* call him back. He failed to answer the call. *I wonder why?* She also pointed out to me the special instructions on the account involved multiple repetitions of \"This customer is abusive\". She also reviewed the entire call. Not even a coaching. \n\nBest. Supervisor. *Ever.*",

Sorry to hear it sounds like you're having a bad experience, can you tell me a little more about the issue?\n\nC: I just made a return at one of your stores, and the money hasn't shown up in my credit account.\n\nR: I see, sorry to hear that. Can you tell me when the return was made?\n\nC: About an hour ago. I want my money.\n\nR: Ah, I see. When a return is made for credit back, it may take a day or two to show up in the account depending on your financial institution.\n\nC: My financial institution is very fast. You guys are sitting on my money.\n\nR: I understand, but as fast as your financial institution may be, it still takes some time for *our* systems to process everything so that the money can be credited back to you securely.\n\nC: No, you're sitting on my money. If I don't see the money in my account in the next 15 minutes, I'm disputing the charge.\n\nR: Can you tell me how much the return was for?\n\nC: $40, but it's not the money, it's the principle of the thing. I know how corporate America is. You're sitting on my money just because you can to spite me. I want you to credit the money back right away.\n\nR: I don't have access to the systems that handle that. I'll be happy to file an official complaint on your behalf, however.\n\nC: Yeah, you'll probably file it and then delete it right afterwords, right? Am I right? If you won't return my money I'll just call my bank when we're done and dispute the charge, and then I'm calling my lawyer. \n\nR: In that case, your bank would contact us regarding the transaction and would be informed that the money was already being credited back. However, I can file a complaint for you, and it's a permanent record that I cannot delete.\n\nC: Fine. Every time I deal with this company it sucks! Put that on the official form: _ SUCKS!\n\nR: *typing, couldn't talk for a second because I was having a hard time not laughing. I quoted him on the official complaint because he requested it.*\n\nC: You don't care, do you? I know you don't. I *tried* to get the number for corporate, but I couldn't find it because you guys are so secretive. Classic corporate America.\n\nR: This is the _ corporate office's customer service department.\n\nC: (pause) I want email confirmation that you're actually putting all this on file. From somebody higher up.\n\nR: Ok, I'll mark it for email follow up from one of our supervisors here in corporate to provide that confirmation. The name I'm seeing we have on file for this number is C, correct?\n\nC: Yeah. And remember that name, because you're gonna be hearing it again.\n\nAt that point I took down his email address and finished the call. In a way I regret not asking if that was a threat because it probably would have baited this guy, but I never heard his name again.",

So you don't have anything to worry about. Your account is completely safe.\n\nPEWM: Fine, I'll just call the police.

CR sound like an older woman (60+) she had an accent, maybe eastern European. \n\nME: thank you for calling ( store banner ) customer relations. My name is ME how can I help you today? \n\nCR: I was at your store this morning, and I noticed the cashiers were all wearing these blue t-shirts with a picture of a dog on the back.

And then what happened ? \n\nCR: what is wrong with you people ??!! You are advertising dog nutrition  when there are people starving in the world! Who do you think you are ?? Once every single person in the world I fed, then you should feed dogs. \n\n( I am floored at this point, my brain went blank.

You guys are killing cows, chickens and pigs to feed dogs !! Dogs!! Humans are our first obligation !! Animals are animals, you guys are blind, you don't know that dogs are animals. Animals can naturally take care of themselves.

        "text": "This just happened, and I thought it was crazy and strange, so I'm posting it from my desk...\n\nFriday afternoon, wireless call center in the Midwest USA. A customer call comes in, not verified in the IVR, so all I see is the customer's name and the type of phone she has. My spiel comes on \"Thanks for calling, this is Moomatic, may I have your name please?\" (Customer will be C, I'll be M)\n\nC: GET ME THE POLICE\n\nM: I'm sorry ma'am, this is wireless company.\n\nC: I NEED TO REACH NEW HAMPSHIRE POLICE, MY SON IS ON FACEBOOK LIVE TRYING TO COMMIT SUICIDE, HIS LIFE IS ON YOUR HANDS!\n\nNow, before I go on with this, two things - (1) the customer, at least from my point of view, thought we were a switchboard. (2) the customer may have been trying to call 911 but called 611. (3) the company has a policy for emergency. At the time, should I have looked at that emergency policy? Yes. Did I? Of course not. We're trying to save someone. \n\nAt this moment, I ask the customer where in New Hampshire. She states South Hampton, so I go on Google and find the direct line for the police (we can't call 911 from our work lines) and notify the customer I'll transfer her there...but this is where things get off the rails quick.\n\nC: MY SON IS PROBABLY DEAD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF HOW SLOW YOU ARE!\n\nM: Ma'am, I'm going to transfer you to the police in that area now. One moment.\n\nCall is transferred, end of story? Nope. \n\nI come back from a meeting and I get a email about a failed survey. So I'm on a great streak where I've gotten Yes/Yes surveys for three and a half months without dropping one. I take pride in this (maybe a bit too much) so I open the email. The customer gave me a YES for my company and a NO for me. I failed a survey on an account that I didn't open and the customer did not call about our company's wireless products. \n\nMy streak has ended. Now, I'm livid, so I go to my manager, who says \"I'll review it, but it probably won't be overturned because you didn't stay on the line with the police.\" \n\nRecap: Customer calls in to what she thinks is a switchboard because her son is dying on Facebook live, asks for the police, then says I'm slow, then fails me on a survey. \n\n**UPDATE AS OF 5:51 PM CHICAGO TIME**: The customer left a 52 second verbatim in which, and I'm listening to her as I'm typing, that \"my son was dying from a overdose, I couldn't call the police or the ambulance because \"wireless company\" wouldn't let me (even if you're suspended for Non-Pay, you are able to call 911), which means you guys killed a man today...the gentleman I spoke to directed me to the police...however it was transferred to a hat tip line...YOU GUYS KILLED A MAN TODAY that's all I got to say 'bout that Y'ALL KILLED A MAN TODAY!\"",

        "text": "I manage a pretty large banking center, and want to tell you a story of one of my long term agent’s Terence. In my center we sometimes have two clients that for security reasons have to have completely separate access. Employees from one cannot enter the zone for the other and it is separated with walls like [this](http://transwall.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rspg-01.jpg). Terrance is an odd duck. He is extremely intelligent at technical support, but when it comes to in person conversation he does not talk at all. You never see him talk to anyone, never see him look you in the eye, and certainly do not see him smile, frown or laugh. That is ok, he is good at what he does. We had an agent on the other side of the wall bump into it really hard. This wall was poorly held up. The entire wall collapses on a row of cubicles, with Terrance in it. We rush to lift this wall up, and were really worried someone was injured. We finally get the wall up and cannot find Terrance. Then I hear “Mam, click here to clear your cookies and cache.”. Terrance climbs out from under his desk, sits back in his chair and keeps troubleshooting the call as if literally nothing happened with the customer none the wiser. That was 6 years ago, and Terrance has finally worked up to saying hi to me in the hallway. But I will never forget how hilarious his non reaction was.",

So I work in a call center for a major retail company, and my department is customer service. Believe it or not, it's not so bad. I generally don't get a lot of bad calls or customers I can't handle. We even have lines dedicated to calling into if we have process questions or yada yada. But every once in a while I'll get the one I can't do anything with.\n\nI'll be NCR (Nice Customer Service Rep)\n\nThe customer will be AD (Annoying Dumbass)\n\nNCR: Thank you for calling Blank this is NCR how can I help you?\n\nAD: Well hi. I would like to discuss a few issues with you.\n\n(Uh? Okay). \n\nNCR: What's going on today AD?\n\nAD: Well I am a teacher and don't make a lot of money and I have to send my kids off to college this semester. I have a refrigerator that I cannot get serviced by your company until 3 weeks out because you don't have any service people in the local area. I've already contacted the manufacturer directly and they are coming out, but it's still gonna be some time. I have to keep walking back and forth to my freezer, your company service is terrible. What I want to know is where is the corporate responsibility??? Why does blank still sell fridges they cannot service?\n\n(What the hell? You have someone coming out and you're calling in over this?)\n\nNCR: AD I certainly apologize that it's an issue for you, I can document this a concern for you and also get you connected with the department who can help you more with your appliance.\n\nAD: That's not what I asked. I want to know why your company does this! Your company has corporate responsibility!\n\n(What the fuck.)\n\nNCR: Again AD I can document this a concern for you and people can review-\n\nAD- No one will review. I know how these things work. Your company needs to have an answer for me on your corporate responsibility.\n\n*gets stern*\n\nNCR: AD again I don't have the answer but can document and connect you with the correct department.\n\ncue going back and forth literally for over 20 minutes, finally get customer to connect with the appliance department \n\nI'm sorry, I'm generally a pretty nice rep and all, but AD is a fucking tool. Bitching about corporate responsibility when she is a teacher and should know that it's mostly bullshit and our company could give a fuck less if we have a service provider in their area, we are in the business of making MONEY, not worrying about customers shit two years later. I had to hold back on this call, because I couldn't believe she would have an education and be this fucking stupid. Also you don't make a lot of money and your kids have to go to college? Yeah that sucks but I'm sitting here barley making it and you're griping over something totally inadequate.\n\nSorry for formatting- on mobile\n\nHave a good day guys :D",

Sometimes I talk to members and sometimes I also talk to patient advocates if they are authorized. And this is my tale of woe with a certain PA.  \n\n**ME**: yours truly  \n**PA**: Mr. Patient Advocate  \n\n***\n\n*ring*  \n\n**ME**: Hi this is ridingthebull, your benefit advocate today, may I have your name please?  \n\n**PA**: Mr. Patient Advocate, I'm calling on behalf of the member today  \n\n**ME**: alright before we get started...  (insert basic hipaa stuff, verification, checking if they have authorization yada yada yada)  \n\n**ME**: So. how can I help you today?  \n\n**PA**: so I just wanna check on the member's address and see if it had changed already...  \n\n**ME**: I can definitely verify the patient address for you, what do you have on your system?  \n\n**PA**: It's [redacted]  \n\n**ME**: oh I do apologize, but I'm seeing a different one on the system...  \n\n**PA**: Is it [redacted]?  \n\n**ME**: yes  \n\n**PA**: we need that changed then.  \n\n**ME**: Is the member's employer been notified yet?   \n\n**PA**: *AUDIBLE SIGH* No, are you going to say that I have to contact their employer? look *MISS* I've been calling you guys yesterday, It's just an address change, just type it and save it how hard is that why do I have to contact the employer?\n\n&gt; fyi, because when the member contacts their employer, usually they have to provide proof first that they have moved/changed addresses, and employers will update that information online/over the phone/mail/fax/summoning the dark lord Satan\n\n**ME**: (*internal groan*) Mr. PA I definitely understand that you need this changed, but we do have standard procedure that we have to follow. Besides, I do want to help you but my system does not allow us BA to change member information. It's their employer responsibility to keep member information updated.  \n\n**PA**: Why are you making this hard? just type in in!! it's that simple! are you stupid or something?  \n\n**ME**: (drops my friendly tone, oh boy I'm serious now...) No, we have standard operating procedures-  \n\n**PA**: (cuts me off) Get me your supervisor, you're useless.  \n\n**ME**: (weakest pushback in the history of pushbacks) I understand, but please be informed though my supervisors have the same access as I am and they will basically tell you the same thing; The employer needs to be contacted.  \n\n**PA**: where are you located?  \n\n**ME**: (switching to neutral one word replies now, I'm done with this guy)Sorry?   \n\n**PA**: jesus, you can't even understand english. **WHERE**.**ARE**.**YOU**.**LOCATED??** (personal attacks now, really?)   \n\n**ME**: Philippines  \n\n**PA**: Figures, forget it. The company is wasting money on you morons... get me someone from the USA at least they can understand me.  \n\n**ME**: (I give up at this point, the call was already 10+mins because the guy loves to rant) alright, please stay on the line for me while I contact our onshore team...   \n\n&gt; so I dial our onshore line and explain to the onshore rep what going on, gave him a warning that he could ask for a supervisor... rep laughs a little and agrees and I conference Mr. PA on the line. Just before I leave the conference line I hear MR PA greet the rep with...  \n\n#**get me your supervisor. NOW**  \n\n***\n\n*I'm so sorry you had to deal with him onshore rep* :( ",

Sometimes customers will call our line when the lines they actually want to reach (like points or online shopping) are busy, thinking they can bypass the queue or something. Earlier in the year there was a huge mess with customers losing hundreds of dollars worth of points and having their points accounts hacked, so lots of angry callers and the hold times for the points department were insane. \n\nIm ME and the crazy lady calling is CL. Doesn’t help that i sound like an actual child on the phone, I’ve heard my own calls, its make me cringe. \n\nME: thank you for calling retail customer relations, my name is awarsaj, how can i help you today? \n\nCL: Good god, i was waiting on hold for an hour with the points dept. so i hung up and decided to call this line instead. You guys really need to treat your customers better, the service is terrible. \n\nME: Im sorry for the inconvenience, what can i address for you today?\n\nCL: What are you doing about the points scandal?? How will you fix this ?? You guys were hacked and lost people all that money. How can i trust this company again? \n\nME: I understand your concerns, however you are speaking with the wrong department so i am unable to give you any definite answers, i can transfer you to the correct department though, but the hold times are long. You can try calling around the evening time when its not so busy, hold times will be less then. (i barely managed to get those sentences out, this woman loved the sound of her own voice)\n\nCL: DON’T YOU DARE TRANSFER ME!!\n\nME: i have no answers for you, i sorry, we are trying our best to get this situation under control. But for more information i will have to transfer you to the correct department. \n\nCL: You already said that! Now answer me, what are you doing about this whole points situaiton??\n\nME: Im sorry for repeating myself, but for more answers you need to speak with the right department. I can transfer you but the hold times will be long unfortunately. \n\nCL: HOW CAN YOU EXPECT ME TO TRUST YOU GUYS EVER AGAIN??\n\nME: I am really sorry ma’am, did you lose points ? was your account hacked ?? \n\nCL: I DONT HAVE AN POINTS ACCOUNT, BUT I WANT ONE BUT NOW I CAN’T TRUST YOU GUYS. HOW WILL YOU FIX THIS ??\n\nME: oh.. you don’t have an account? so you didn’t lose anything? Thats good at least, but you still need to speak with the points dept. i can transfer you if you’d like. \n\nCL: This is terrible customer service *hangs up*\n\nME: Thank you for calling….

I always see people say \"sorry about the formatting, I'm on mobile\" but I generally see no difference in the formatting, my apologies in advance if this is an affront to the eyes and I'll fix it as best as I can\n\nSo I take inbound calls for a major health insurance company based in Texas. Oftentimes our calls are just \"Hi my name is So And So from the doctor's office, I wanted to get benefits for this patient coming in for the following services\". Sometimes it's providers or members of the plan getting tech support because they can't log in. We take payments, file complaints, lots of stuff. Customer service, just over the phone.\n\nI'll be Me, rude bitch of a provider is P.\n\nMe: Hi there, thank you for calling Insurance Company, my name is Short-Haired Nymph. How may I assist you today?\n\nP: I need to get benefits for this patient.\n\nMe: Sure, I'd be more than happy to assist you with that. Before I get too far, could I please get your name and the name of the facility or office you're calling from?\n\nP: Firstname Secondname Thirdname\n\nNow, I'm thinking to myself that it's kinda odd this caller is giving me her full name, because sometimes providers give their last name too because they don't know we only need the first name, but including the middle name is a new one to me. I just assume it's a hyphenated name and take the first name.\n\nMe: Okay, thank you very much. And what is the name of the facility you're calling from?\n\nP: This is for the patient.\n\nMe: Yes, I understand, I apologize for any confusion here. I just mean that I need to know the name of the office or the doctor so I can verify you're in-network.\n\nP: [a little huffy] Well, we *are* in-network. But it's OfficeName Doctorname.\n\nMe: Thank you for that information. Last thing I need from you is your NPI.\n\nP: I think you misunderstood, I'm not calling for anything for the office, I need to get benefit information for this patient.\n\nMe: [getting suspicious, because providers typically understand we need this information to verify the \"identity\" if you will of the provider] I do apologize for any confusion here ma'am, but I need the NPI in order to properly identify the facility in our systems.\n\nP: [extremely irritable with me at this point] But I *just* gave you the name.\n\nMe: Okay, thank you. [I just say that to pacify her and will get back to that later]. Can I get the name of the member that this is about?\n\nP: [increasing in volume with each syllable] Firstname, Secondname, Lastname! Date of birth MM DD YYYY!\n\nMe: [realizing this is the same name she gave me earlier, and that it's the name of the member but that she never gave me her name at the start of the call] Thank you very much. Would you mind if I place you on a brief hold while I pull up the account information?\n\nP: [Quieter, but still annoyed] Sure, okay.\n\nThe policy usually pulls up within like two seconds, I just say that and put her on hold so I can inform a supervisor of the situation, who is also suspicious and believes the caller is refusing to give the NPI because she's not actually a provider, but perhaps a family member pretending to be one because they otherwise don't have access to a relative's information easily. She lets me know to just say the word HIPAA and handle the call from there. ezpz. \n\nMe: Hi there, thank you so much for holding, I do appreciate your patience and I apologize for that wait time. Unfortunately, I still need your NPI to proceed with quoting you any benefit information.\n\nP: [right back to the loud annoyed tone she had before] Listen to me, I don't think you understand, I'm just getting benefits for the PATIENT. You don't NEED my NPI.\n\nMe: Actually, ma'am, due to HIPAA, I need your NPI in order to verify the facility and check if it's in-network for this member's plan. I apologize for any confusion but per HIPAA, in order to protect this member's privacy--\n\nP: FINE! [enunciating each number separately] 1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 9! 0!\n\nMe: [wanting to slap this bitch, this is the only provider that's ever been so uncooperative and rude] Thank you so much for this information. Unfortunately, according to my system, this doctor is not in-network, but let me double-check in a different system real quick, sometimes one updates behind the other. \n\n[A minute or two passes while I actually do check in a second system, which is more accurate, but harder to use. This is the most peaceful part of the call.]\n\nMe: Oh, I'm really sorry but I can't find your facility in any of our systems, and this member doesn't have out-of-network benefits. Is there anything else I can help--\n\nP: But we ARE in-NETWORK!\n\nMe: I do apologize for the confusion, I can reach out to Provider Relations if you like and conference you in to see what the issue may be, but I unfortunately can't quote you any benefits because you do not show as in-network.\n\nP: [hangs up]\n\nIt was one of the weirdest calls I've had, because I usually expect this kind of behavior from members, never providers. Providers are usually the calls I look forward to, even if I have to go over a million lines of claims info, just because they're so much more patient. It's like talking to another employee vs a customer. ",

Call the clinic and warm transfer 2. If no answer then send a message. \n\nI called the clinic and got no answer. So I told the patient I'd send a message and they'd call her back and she hangs up. \n\nI go to start the message and realize I'm missing one key piece of information. I don't have a provider name which is needed in order to even start a message. Normally not an issue for new patients because if there isn't a particular provider they were told to see (in this case I confirmed there wasn't and she was brand new to that clinic) I can just pick one at random from their provider list. Except that that part of their instructions didn't even exist. They told us to send a message but didn't provide all the necessary information to do so. \n\nSo I call my helpline. We look all over for anything helpful and there isn't much. Usually there's a front desk number and a backline for all the clinics. This one just has one number and it's the one I already called. Nothing else. So the helpline supervisor tells me to try calling the pools for the techs. I got the pleasure of speaking with the world's bitchiest tech. Me is me and BT is bitchy tech. \n\nBT: this is the diagnostic lab. How can I help you?\n\nMe: Yes-\n\nBT: [completely interrupting me] Medical records number first. \n\nMe: Yes patient's record number is 1234567. \n\nBT: Okaaaay.... [said just like this like she can't imagine why I have to bother her] \n\nMe: I don't have this patient on the line anymore but I called the front desk and...\n\nBT: [interrupting again] Why are you calling? This patient hasn't been seen at this clinic before. \n\nMe: [Trying to be polite to this rude lady] Yes so she's new to the clinic and wants to be scheduled but-\n\nBT: [interrupting again] You can't patch her through. I can't schedule her here. \n\nMe: I don't have the patient on the phone but I couldn't send a message without a provider name and-\n\nBT: Well don't bother. I can't help you. \n\nMe: Excuse me, can I please speak? I'm trying to tell you that that patient is new to the clinic. She's expecting a call from you guys and she's not on the line because I was about to send a message. \n\nBT: Well I still can't help you \n\nMe: Well I don't know what to tell you. I can't call her back and she's expecting a call from you so call her back or don't but I'm just telling you what she wants. \n\nBT: You are so rude! Give me your name!\n\nMe: Sure it's Umbracelestia. I'm at the contact center. Bye. *click* \n\n---\n\nI hate people who won't let me tell them what I need to say and then act like I'm in the wrong. It's not my fault my directions were woefully incomplete and nobody will let me get a full sentence in. I did my job. If the clinic doesn't do theirs then that's their prerogative but no need to be a bitch to me. ",

        "text": "Ah Saturday, where I fucked up by agreeing to work an extra 2 and half hours. So, on top of waking up at 6am to get at work (usually wake up at 12), we get some of the most irate jackasses and absolutely clueless people. \n\nSo a lady calls in, and her account doesn't pop. Okay, this is normal, especially today. \n\nMe: Is this a closed account?\n\nCx: yes it is. \n\nMe: okay ma'am, what is the account number? \n\nCx: I don't know. \n\nMe: alright, since it's a closed account and you don't have the account number, I'd need your social to find it. \n\nCx: that's used for identification and I don't give that out, so find my account. \n\nMe: ma'am, I can't- \n\nCx: I bet somewhere in your little system you have my account and you'd find my account number if you did your job!\n\nMe: ma'am \n\nCx: JACKASS click. \n\nWell, enjoy your account being sold to a third party company and getting your credit wrecked. .\n\nNext call\n\nMe: [asks for name]\n\nCx: yes it's Puts Self in Bad Spot. \n\nMe: alright ma'am, what is your four digit pin? \n\nCx: I'm in the process of moving and I'm homebound with IVs. All that information is at my old house. \n\nMe: well ma'am without that I can't help. \n\nCx: but my phones are off and I'm homebound. \n\nMe: ma'am, I would love to be able to help(And I would. I actually like helping people), but I have no way of doing anything. \n\nCx: so you're saying I have to drive 45 minutes both way to get that info? \n\nMe: That would appear to be the case if you can't remember your 4 digit pin. \n\nCx: [ranting about company, I wanna switch stuff, something about nurses, more about home bound with IVs]\n\nMe: ma'am, I wish I could help but my hands are tied. I'm sorry. \n\nCx: I can't even call an ambulance if I need  help! \n\nMe: (I'm actually pretty tired of her, because while I understand her position, I literally cannot do anything, and I can only hear a sob story 20 times before I no longer give a shit) well ma'am, all cellphones are able to call 911 so long as they're powered, so should an emergency arise you can contact 911. \n\nCx: (finally realizing she can't circumvent verification) oh, that's fine then. That's fine. \n\nMe: I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance (sincerely, because I honestly would have reconnected her if I could have), I hope your day gets better. \n\nCx: click\n\nAnother jewel, was the lady calling in about why e-checks from June bounced. Literally cannot see why. Just R10 (meaning not approved by cx). I tell the cx care rep this, and he still insists I speak with cx. Cx goes on for 7 minutes about it. Finally says that the reco and return check fees are unfair. Honestly, not wrong because there's no reason on our end it should have happened. So we waived the fees, but Jesus lady, this occurred in JUNE. Early June. They'd been visible for over a month. Why the Hell are you calling now? \n\nBut honestly, it was an alright day. While the majority of calls are a pain in the ass, we get more people than normal who are a pleasure to speak with. One person was celebrating their birthday the entire month. Another was truly trying to catch up their bill and just got a good paying job, so he is finally out of the woods.  One old man just wanted to talk about the weather and was a great dude, felt bad having to end the call cause he was a really good guy with no one to talk to. \n\nGotta love Saturday",

I'm used to scheduling for clueless people and can usually figure out what even the most oblivious patient needs but this guy was just too much. His chart showed that he had been seen at probably 20-30 clinics just in the past year. CG is clueless guy. \n\nMe: Thank Yu for calling the medical center. What can I help you with?\n\nCG: yes I need to make an appointment. My tube in my chest fell out. \n\nMe: Let's take a look into that for you. [Verifies chart information] Do you know which clinic you're wanting to see? \n\nCG: The [Hospital name]. \n\nMe: There are a couple hundred clinics at that hospital. Do you know he name of the doctor maybe?\n\nCG: Dr. Lee [name changed but it was a very common last name that could be a first or a last name]\n\nMe: Is that a first name or a last name?\n\nCG: I don't know\n\nMe: I don't see a doctor with that first or last name on your chart. Is it a doctor you've seen before?\n\nCG: Yes he's at [Hospital name]. \n\nMe: Yes I understand that but I need to be able to find out which clinic. Do you know the specialty?\n\nCG: Maybe radiology?\n\n(Side note, our radiologists do imaging, they generally aren't seeing patients at the hospital and the ones that are see patients at another hospital) \n\nMe: Were you trying to have imagine done? Like an MRI or CT scan?\n\nCG: No I just want to see Dr. Lee for the tube in my chest!\n\n[I won't bore you. We went back and forth several times with me trying to get any useful information. He didn't know what kind of tube or the specialty or the clinic or really anything useful. Just kept saying the clinic is the hospital] \n\nMe: Sir, there are at least a hundred clinics at this hospital. I'm not sure where you want me to schedule you without more information. \n\nCG: I told you! [Hospital name]! \n\nMe: Again, that's not the clinic, that's the hospital name. There are many clinics within the hospital. \n\nCG: Are you new?\n\nMe: No -.- I just don't have the information I need from you to schedule you. \n\nCG: I told you everything already! You need to make me an appointment!\n\nMe: Let me do some research. Just a moment. \n\nAt this point I put the guy on hold and called a supervisor. She looked with me and had no idea what this guy was getting at. We looked all over to see what it was and came up empty handed. Right before I went to go tell him I can't help him without more information he hung up. Clearly he thought I was an idiot for not being able to read his damn mind. ",

She had been moved to a new office, her PC and twin monitors were set up fine and worked, but she wanted the right most monitor to be her main one, and currently her left on was.  Simple call right?  Go into the display properties and switch them.  \n\nWell, the tech who took that call, instead of going the easy route, told the user she would need to physically disconnect the monitors, move monitors, swap cables, etc.  Why he did this (he had worked there for years) is still beyond me.  So she ended up having to call back awhile later and I overheard a coworker talking to her and I got nosy and asked what was up  (the original tech worked at another location but we all took calls from a common number).  \n\nNow the user can't get anything to work on the monitors and can't figure out where to plug things in.  Now someone would have to go onsite to fix what should have been a simple call.  It was at a location where there wasn't any onsite tech support because it was the weekend.  So now the on-call had to be paged.  Getting hold of the on-call for that location was always iffy, so that ate up an hour of  time.  When they finally got a hold of the tech, he wasn't happy, but he drove into the office.  Only then did we find out, that the original tech had gotten the location wrong in the first place, and the user was at a facility on the other side of the country (she'd moved offices remember?) so a completely different on-call tech for that geographic area had to be called in, told the whole story and drive in on his day off to fix a problem that support should have been able to fix in about a minute.  \n\nWe still laughed about that story when I quit working there a few years later.  That original tech is still working there to the best of my knowledge.\n\n*Sorry for the original wall of text",

How can I help you?\n\nAP: Yes I was speaking to one of your colleagues who was about to give me the URL to register my son online. \n\nMe: Are you referring to (online program for established patients used to communicate with doctors)? \n\nAP: No I have no idea what you're talking about. My son is a new patient. \n\nMe: So you're trying to register him for a new patient chart? I'm sorry but that can only be done over the phone. \n\nAP: Nope that's not true. Your colleague was about to give me the URL before the phone cut off. \n\nMe: I'm not aware of any way to register a patient online but let me check with my supervisor. \n\n(I won't bore you with the details. My supervisor said patients can only be registered over the phone) \n\nMe: Thank you for holding AP. I spoke with my supervisor and confirmed this. There isn't a way to register online. It needs to be done over the phone. \n\nAP: Ugh! Well don't you have a lot of errors then with mistranscribing information? I'd like to do this online. \n\n[Not anymore mistakes then you'll make by fat fingering keys]\n\nMe: We're careful to confirm all the information. Would you like me to register your son? \n\nAP: I guess since there's no other way... (provides son's information and I see he already has a chart)\n\nMe: It looks like your son already has a chart with us. [Which is why we don't let you do it online because otherwise you'd have created a duplicate chart, nice.] \n\nAP: He's never been seen there before so he doesn't have a chart and you are mistaken. \n\nMe: [Your son has a super unique name and you gave me his birthdate as well. I'm telling you we have a chart dumbass] Well it looks like he was seen by an autism clinic within the system in 2011. \n\nAP: Oh... okay I guess he does. \n\nMe: let's confirm that the information is up to date. Does he have the XYZ insurance?\n\nAP: No but can we deal with it later? I need to schedule him an appointment at the ABC clinic for a wellness visit. \n\nMe: Yes we can do that afterwards. \n\nMe: It looks like our soonest with any pediatrician is 8/17 with Dr. Fakename. \n\nAP: Yes we'll take it. \n\nMe: I have him scheduled on 8/17 to see Dr. Fakename at 2pm at the ABC clinic. \n\nAP: Does Dr. Fakename specialize in autism?\n\nMe: I don't see that she does in her profile, no. \n\nAP: Well we'd like a pediatrician that does. Can you check?\n\n[You're kidding me bro]\n\nMe: Sure just a moment and I'll check. \n\n[For some perspective, this is a large clinic with at least 20 pediatricians that are accepting new patients and I had to open at least a dozen profiles before I found one that specializes in autism.]\n\nMe: It looks like Dr. Madeup specializes in autism. I have an appointment with her in September. \n\nAP: That's so far... do you have any others?\n\n[Are you fucking kidding me? Get off my phone]\n\nMe: I'm afraid not. \n\nAP: Fine we'll take that one. \n\nMe: Alright I've got him scheduled. Anything else I can help you with?\n\nAP: you didn't get the insurance. \n\n[Well if we'd have done this shit first and you didn't distract me with needing to look through provider bios that you could have looked through yourself beforehand...]\n\nMe: Oh yes. What's the company? \n\nAP: It's Premera\n\nMe: And does the card say (several key words to let me know the plan)? \n\nAP: No it's [Name of a plan that's specific to a different payor]. \n\nMe: Are you sure it's Premera? That particular plan name is a Regence plan. \n\nAP: Well unless Premera got bought out by Regence last night then it's Premera!\n\n[Snarky bastard. Fine I'll run it your way and we'll find out.] \n\nMe: (confirms policy details) I'll run this and I'll be right back. \n\n[Sure enough, look it's fucking Regence. And the subscriber name comes back as the father's name]\n\nMe: And are you the subscriber for this insurance? \n\nAP: No [kid's name] is. \n\n[So your 11 year old pays for his own insurance?]\n\nMe: I'm showing here that it's your name that's coming back as the subscriber. \n\nAP: No! He's the subscriber! I just pay for it!\n\n[That's what the subscriber is you dumb ass. Whatever, the insurance company says it's him so his name goes down as the subscriber.]\n\nMe: insurance is all set! \n\nAP: So how do we get my son's medical records sent to the clinic?\n\nMe: If you have a copy you can fax them or your son's most recent clinic can fax them to 555-123-4567. \n\nAP: Fax? Are you serious? Get an updated system!\n\n[What, do you want us to figure out how to upload those files directly to the doctor's brain? This is what all the clinics do for medical records that are sent from one major system to another. There isn't another secure way] \n\nMe: If you'd rather, you can most certainly bring in paper copies if you'd prefer. \n\nAP: Fine they'll be faxed! Listen, do you guys ever plan on changing things so patient's can be registered online \n\n[So people like you can create a duplicate chart for your kid, add the wrong company insurance policy, and have them bill it to your 11 year old kid? Yeah I don't think so.] \n\nMe: Not to my knowledge. \n\nAP: That's stupid. And this took way too long by the way!\n\n[Really? Because this call would have been over 10 minutes ago and I'd be on a bus going home if you'd quit bitching about how \"archaic\" our systems are and giving me misinformation literally every step of the way] \n\nMe: Have a nice evening sir.

She asked if I’d like to have some, and I obliged. Among the otherwise mediocre branded pens and sponges was an unexpected treat: a Bluetooth shower speaker, complete with suction cup on the underside. \n\nWhile fiddling with the speaker as I took calls, I noticed it looked like the bulb at the end of a Dalek’s eye stalk. Feeling immature, I decided to jam the thing onto the middle of my forehead and pretend to be a Dalek. Customers would call in to complain about this or that, and while externally I’d put on the obligatory customer service smile and tell them it’ll all be OK, in my head I was chanting “EX TER MI NATE! EX TER MI NATE!”\n\n‘Twas all in good fun until about 10 or 15 minutes later when nature called. I decided it wouldn’t do to walk around the office with this thing on my forehead, so I attempted to gently pull it off. It wouldn’t budge. After digging my nails underneath the cup, I broke the suction and took it off, thinking that was that and got up. On my way to the bathroom my supervisor asked, “What did you do to your forehead? It’s all purple!” Upon entering the bathroom, I looked in the mirror to see a massive round purple hickey in the middle of my forehead. Not being terribly conscious about my appearance, I decided to laugh it off and take some pictures.",

Still it was better than getting screamed at by people that wanted to cash that 10$ check without re-signing up. Its not fun to explain to people I couldnt give a code, no matter what if they didnt sign up.\n\nI didnt last long at that job.",

The only damn way that I can make my payment is to pick up the phone after an entire day on the phones, which sucks.\n\nI was especially mad today because I had signed up for auto pay not once, but twice in the last five months but I was past due again.  So I called in and after ten minutes, someone picks up.  I say hi, she says hi and then... the call drops.  I had to call in AGAIN because my shitty internet provider can't have a functioning payment processing system.  I wasn't a happy person when I called back.\n\nI got a guy with a serious southern drawl who was nice enough, but I was annoyed.  I mentioned that I got hung up on previously and he apologized and said that it was probably a dropped call.  He went on to take my payment and I mentioned that I should be set up on auto pay.\n\nBless this guy.  He looked into the issue, found that I'd been setup on my very old card for auto pay and sent off a request to have my account number changed.  And beyond that, he said he'd check my account tomorrow to make sure it was changed and call me personally if something went wrong.  I could have kissed him.  It was like he was doing a training role play where he was all set up to say the right things.  We even chatted a bit about memes and he said that 'he couldn't believe people didnt like them, because he didn't need that negativity in his life'.\n\nSo I left a message on their kudos hotline, after checking with him that it would be something that he wanted.  I have to say, l always appreciate getting someone good because I know damned well how hard it is to deal with the phones all day.  \n\nThanks Georgia meme lover.

They gave DVD sets, posters, coffee mugs etc. for the person with the highest sales in their pod (group of 10/15 people in a cubical grouping).\n\nThe director of our site thought it would be a great idea to alert everyone when a big sale (over $50 USD) happened.

I worked in a call center for a major credit union that primarily services two branches of the US military. At the time I worked in the loan department.\n\nAs a bit more background information, for those of you who don't know this, for military personnel it's very easy to determine their pay. It's all based on rank and years of service.\n\nME: your truly    SG: sailor girl\n\nME: Thank you for calling Major CU. This is cspotphantom. How may I help you today?\n\nSG: I would like to apply for a car loan.\n\nWe confirm some basic information so that I know SG is who she says she is. Based on her voice and demeanor I picture a short, petite and very innocent girl.\n\nME: Have you already picked out a vehicle or are you still looking?\n\nSG: I want a Beetle!\n\nME: That sounds great! Have you found the specific one you want to buy or are you still looking?\n\nSG: I want a green one!\n\nME: That's a very nice for choice. I'm going to assume you're not at a dealership right now. Is that correct?\n\nSG: Yes sir.\n\nME: It sounds like the best thing for you is a pre-approved loan. This will allow you to look for your Beetle while knowing what your spending limit is. How much would you like to borrow?\n\nSG: Well, I'm not sure. The new ones are around $17,000. How much can I borrow?\n\nME: Ma'am, are you still an E2 with less than two years of service?\n\nSG: Yes. I just finished basic training.\n\nME: I'm going to do you a favor and suggest you don't submit the application for the loan. Based on your income (before taxes it was roughly  $1200 a month) I can tell you that there is no way that you will be approved. \n\nThere was a long pause followed by some sniffles. I really hated this part of my job. \n\nSG: I really want this Beetle. Is there anything that I can do.\n\nME: If you have a cosigner that qualifies it would greatly increase your chances of being approved. Do you think you could get a cosigner?\n\nAnother long pause followed by increase sniffling. At this point I'm certain the tears have started as well.\n\nSG: My recruiter said if I joined the Navy I could get a new beetle. Do you think he would cosign for ME?\n\nME: No ma'am, I don't. I'm really very sorry.\n\nI think I actually heard the levy break as she had just begun to realize what she had done with her life and why. I'm not sure I've ever heard anyone cry like that before or after.\n\nSG: Thank you sir (barely audible through the torturous crying)\n\nI can't believe what some recruiters will say to get someone to sign up. Poor girl was staring down the barrel of a six year enlistment for a car she'll never get. That was probably the first of many hard life lessons she has learned.",

Afternoon was hectic cause they typically had good lists with lots of expected responses, while evenings it resembled more like cold calling, though I think it actually came from ballot information or something the city collected...\n\nAnyways, we called throughout the evening, changing target areas as the night progressed so that we were hitting parts of the nation where people were actually at home and able to answer questions and hopefully not asleep yet. The expected response rate was low and I was typically ahead of my target by a good 40%, but still had to deal with those people who like to yell at you for calling. Luckily I could hang up for a variety of reasons as long as I marked the correct disposition (usually Initial Refusal - Call Again if you were an asshole).\n\nAnyways, near the end of my shift we were dialing a few states over and I got this call.\n\nMe: Hello, my name is Greenitthe calling on behalf of ..., and I have just a few questions for you about upcoming changes to the bike lane system in your city.\n\nOld Man: Oh I don't know about that, I stay at home most days.\n\nMe: So you do not use the local roadways to drive between locations.

I kinda forget I'm on the clock and have a quick conversation with him about his grandkids wanting a bike and when I got my first bike.

        "text": "TLDR: caller was a jerk to me, on my last day I enacted some petty revenge.\n\nNote: this occurred about four years ago when I worked in the call center for a large ISP. When I started I worked in the billing department but I \"moved my way up\" so to speak and I put in orders for technicians making sales in peoples homes and occasionally the direct sales reps. \n\nI worked the later shift so I could get that dollar raise and it was usually pretty slow so I could read my book or talk to my neighbors or whatever. The DSR's and techs calling later on in my shifts were sometimes pretty...interesting. \n\nOne night, about 10:30 pm (an hour before I go home so I wasn't doing much at this time) a tech calls in to upgrade his customer to a two year service agreement. He has it all worked out, he promised them hbo for free, the fastest internet, a fucking land line. Almost all of the services worked out to a low low price. He even has the codes for me to put in so I don't have to look them up. Great. \n\nOf course it doesn't work. I had never heard of this agreement before and I had worked there for a few months at this point. Practically an old hat. I told him that it is coming up invalid and I would have to look for a similar agreement. I didn't have to do this but I wasn't doing anything else with my time. I could have just said \"please check with your supervisor about what you can and cannot offer\" but he said that he already installed everything and he wasn't in the home anymore he was in his truck and he didn't want to go back in there. \n\nWell thats not allowed because for the person to enter in to any agreement they have to be present to go through an automated system verbal agreement. I tell him this and he says \"Well why don't you put someone else on that is smarter than you and can figure out how to punch some numbers into a computer so I can go home!\"  \n\nNormally I'm not allowed to offer someone to speak to my supervisor but I was pretty sure given the circumstances it would be ok so I called my sup over and gave him the rundown on what was going on. He told the tech basically exactly what I said, which pissed him off. My supervisor told him to talk to his supervisor and call back when he gets it worked out. End of story.\n\nJust kidding, about fifteen minutes later he calls in with a different two year agreement that his sup gave him and the family agreed to. I recognize the agreement and say I can set up the account if the person that the account is being set up for is present. He told me again that he was in his truck and he didn't want to go back to the house. I told him that he would have to to set up the agreement.  He then says \"oh Mr Jose its nice to see you haha my company needs you to do this agreement thing over the phone will you do that?\" to which he clearly responded to himself \"si senior\" I put him on hold and explained the situation to my sup so he could take over the call again. By the time I got back to the phone he had hung up. \n\n The funny thing is that there were only two other people on the floor in my department at that time and the system automatically routes callers who disconnect and calls back to the previous call center employee if they are available. Each time I would see his name and phone number pop up on my caller ID I would greet him with my biggest and most exaggerated \"ITS A GREAT DAY AT GIANT ISP THIS IS LIZLEMONKUSH HOW MAY I HELP YOU TODAAAY\" and he would hang up without saying anything until we closed for the night.\n\nSomething about that asshole always stuck with my while I worked there. The way he talked to me and the way he hung up on me multiple times that night always irked me and I wondered what ever happened to that account. We were the only department of our kind in the whole company so any time he would call to set up that account we all knew what was up and would get in trouble if something like that actually went through. \n\nFast forward to my last day. I'm taking it easy because I'm not really worried about stats or anything and I knew I wasn't going to be back. Mainly I was sitting in after call prep time pretending to work while my colleagues were getting pretty busy. The calls were back to back and there were even some calls in the queue. Any time I would take myself out of the after call prep a new call would beep in and I would have to take care of their business. \n\nWell lo-and-behold the call center gods must have been wishing me a fond farewell because who else should happen to call on my last day but the douche tech that I had been dreaming of telling off. I really wanted to let him have it. This was my chance. In my normal cheerful manner I answered the call and judging by his demeanor he didn't remember me. He explained the situation about how he sold a price guarantee but it wasn't going through on his end (they had just started using ipads for putting in orders and were still working out the kinks) \n\nhmmm yes I can take a look at the account and see about getting that set up for you! Oh dear it looks like one of the codes must be wrong I have to look it up! Please hold for just a moment! \n\nI then put him on mute and sat listening to him for about 10 minutes. Eventually he gives up and calls back. Well who should happen to get the call but little ol me. This time I answered the call and put it on mute immediately and pretended to take the call as normal. he sat on the line for about five more minutes, probably because the wait to call our department was so long. \nThe next two times he called I simply hung up on him as soon as i answered. \n\nPetty, yes.\nsatisfying, very. \n\n  ",

I'll start with one that I'll probably never forget.\n\nSo I was a survey/interviewer who worked for a market research company and we just had to get as many completed surveys as possible. \nI was working on a Sunday morning when the shift target was only 5, so you can imagine how quiet it was, an hour probably went by with not a single pick up. I finally got someone who answered their phone but sounded very sleepy. I did my whole introduction, and asked permission to proceed to which he said yes but still sounded pretty sleepy. As I was a few questions in, his replies were very delayed and muffled and he was breathing heavily, so I asked him if he was okay and apologised if I had woken him up. He said no it was fine, and that I should continue so I asked the next question but he started making noises. Again I asked if he was okay, and he replied saying 'yeah I'm just having a 'w..k'. Please just keep talking'\nI just froze and didn't know what to do! I put him on mute and removed my headset and signalled for the supervisor to come over, I told her what happened but she insisted I continue and try to finish as much as possible. The man on the phone held on for a while but thank god he hung up and I didn't have to say another word to him!",

Now would you mind telling me why you're cancelling. What could we have done better?\n\nMe: Nothing really. I just wanted to go with Other Company.\n\nSA: All right sir, take me just a few minutes to fill this out. Now it does say here that you have [internet package] which is slower than a tick on hound dog. Sure you wouldn't want to try [other package] I also see you got a bill for $75, I can give you a month free and take off that there bill.\n\nMe: Thank you sir, that's a very generous offer but I would really like to go ahead with Other Company.\n\nSA: No worries there sir. \n\n[Spends about a minute typing]\n\nSA: All right sir got you all squared away.

Now this ISP bills for a month in advance and whenever changes happen the bill tends to become a prorated nightmare that can take a while to figure out/explain.\n\nNow since her case was taking longer to investigate and the supervisors were being real stingy about hold time (we're supposed to come back every minute) I started chatting her up while looking at her past bills.\n\nSo this lady starts telling me about her life starting from her childhood and how she had a really nice and loving dad but a terrible mother while she was young and moved out early because of conflicts with the maternal.\n\nNow at this point im just doing the verbal equivalent of nodding my head and grunting agreement as im focused on this bill, but suddenly the conversation takes a turn I would never have expected.\n\nShe starts telling me how, years after moving out, she started hanging out with her father again, as he'd ditched her mother by then, and, as she was single at the moment and she loved her dad so veru much they ended up dating.\n\nAt this point I had just figured out the bill and was about to end things, but I kinda sat there in shock as the story took a turn. The lady then proceeds to tell me how after they started dating, they went to a bar together, and ended up coming back to her home together. She then puts on a sultry voice and says with heavy emphasis that it was then that she got to know him as a man, wink wink.\n\nAt this point im freaked out and want this conersation to end but im too polite to just ignore it and talk about the bill, so I answer: Im sure this must have changed your relationship very much mam', now, about your internet bill...\n\nI quickly end things without leaving room for conversation and proceed to tell my coworkers what happened, as they shake their head in disbelief and shock.",

I am embarrassed but when I get really frustrated or upset, I begin to cry. The last 15 mins of my call I was trying so hard to not sound it but it was tough. She didn't sound like she caught on to the cracking in my voice but I cried on my drive home. I was so upset at how ridiculous the call was and it took that long and I clocked out half an hour late :l Had to let this out. Thanks for reading.",

Product issues and Returns are dealt with by us. Unfortunately we also deal with crazy customers who just can’t seem to get their shit together at any given time. CW will be coworker, AL will be Angry Lady.\n\n&gt;CW: *Insert Long Spiel Introduction here*\n\n&gt;AL: AH FUCK! YOU’RE THE ZILLIONTH PERSON I’VE CALLED ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND NO ONE CAN HELP ME! FUCKING FIX THIS RIGHT NOW!\n\n&gt;CW:Ok Ma’am, what seems to be the problem?\n\n&gt;AL: I placed 2 gift orders for both of my daughters who live in *different state* but both gifts ended up with me. Can you fix this?\n\n&gt;CW: Absolutely! *insert fake apology here*, may I have your order number please?\n\n&gt;AL: DO I REALLY HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW? I’M DRIVING! *Insert Profanities*. Alright, lemme get my glasses\n\nWhy she was on the phone while driving was beyond us, especially for something like this! Also, driving without glasses is a serious danger.\n\n&gt;CW:Ok Ma’am, whenever you’re ready\n\n&gt;AL: *Sighs* ok, I’m too lazy to tell you the whole number so the last 4 digits are XXSS. Find something NOW!\n\nOne of the things customers seem to not understand is that the order numbers work like this: 10 digit number followed by a 2 digit suffix. Like so:\n\n&gt;XXXXXXXXXX   SS\n\nThe suffix simply lets us determine who’s calling. In terms of gift orders, it lets us know if the gift giver or the recipient is calling us back. However, the suffix is not a part of the order number. AL basically gave us the last TWO digits of her order number and so we couldn’t find AL’s order in the system.\n\n&gt;CW: Sorry Ma’am, it looks like your order is not in the sys-\n\n&gt;AL: IT’S NOT THERE? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! ASDFGHJKLBLAHBLAHBLAH!\n\nAL basically went crazy after that moment, my CW tells me that she starts swearing and yelling unintelligibly. This goes on for a while as CW tries to cool the situation down. Then a few moments later…\n\n&gt;AL: FUCK! I don’t have time for this! I’m getting brain surgery! Get me on the phone with a Manager or something. NOW!\n\n&gt;CW: *choking back the tears* I’m-I’m sorry ma’am will do.\n\n&gt;[CW Transfers to Sup] \n\nI don’t quite know how shit went down afterwards but I remember seeing her very upset afterwards. She told me this story, and while my script isn’t exactly verbatim, it’s mostly accurate in how the interaction played out. Hope the surgery went sucessful, seriously. AL has some serious issues...\n",

        "text": "Originally posted on r/maliciouscompliance\n\nAbout 10 years ago I started my first ever telephone job, working in the complaints departments of a telecommunications company. \n\nI was out of training by a week, still trying to learn the ropes, when this customer called in and straight away demanded to speak to the same person they spoke to last week, a girl called Nat. \n\nNow being so new, I only knew a handful of people in the department which housed just over a hundred staff. Company policy was to refer to the customer by name, so I started by asking for his. \n\n'No, no, no' he said, 'I don't want to go through all this again, just pass me through to Nat.'\n\nI explained that I didn't know any Nat personally but if he gave me his name and account details I would try to find them. This apparently wasn't good enough, as last week this Nat had told him that everyone knew her and next time he called in he should just ask for her by name. I tried to explain that our department had 2 Natalies and a Natalia (I'd looked this up while he was talking), but with his name and account details I could see which 'Nat' had been working his case and pass him through to the right person.\n\nAgain the customer refused to give me these details, telling me how he's sick of repeating his complaint from the start every time he calls in. We go back and forth like this for nearly 10 minutes when final he says 'All right, my name is Mickey Mouse and my account number is 123456'\n\nAt this point I'd had enough, company police was to not call a customer a liar, even when you knew something wasn't true (we were suppose to say they were maybe mistaken). So I pretended to type on my keyboard and said 'Oh I'm sorry Mr Mouse but that account number doesn't seem to be valid. Let me read that back to you, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, was that correct Mr Mouse? You see Mr Mouse, normally account numbers are 8 digits long. Mr Mouse do you have a recent bill with you so we can check this account number is correct.'\n\nThe phone call lasted a few more minutes and I got in calling him Mr Mouse about half a dozen times. That afternoon I got pulled up by my manger about the call, asking me what all the Mr Mouse stuff was he'd overhead earlier.\n\nI explained the story to him and said I didn't want to call the customer a liar. He agreed the customer was an arse but maybe I shouldn't lay it on so thick next time :) \n\nEdit: Spelling",

I'm **cgf** and I have a question.  \n**--me:** Hi, **cgf**! Before that, what number does this concern?  \n**cgf:** It's |number|.  \n**--me:** Thank you.  \n*Hmm ... Not in our system ... -makes a quick operator check- ... Ah, not our customer! ... Oh well, it's slow anyway.*  \n**--me:** So, what's your question?  \n**cgf:** Well, I'm here in bed trying to sleep, but my boyfriends phone keeps lighting up with some notification or other, it's for this app called Tinder^(I'm sure we all know what it is, right?), do you happen to know what that is?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Oh man ... This ain't gonna be pretty*  \n*Tries to quickly think of a way to explain it in a delicate way*  \n*All I'm getting is \"dating app\"*  \n*Frack it, let's go with that!*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**--me:** Well ... Tinder is ... Ah ... A dating app, of sorts ...  \n**cgf:** It's a WHAT!?  \n**--me:** A dating app.  \n**cgf:** *&lt;is silent for a moment&gt;*  \n**cgf:** Thank you for your help. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBefore she hangs up the phone, I can hear her start screaming bloody murder to wake up her boyfriend (the owner of the phone).  \nNow, me, being the old dog in the industry that I am just laugh it off and relays the story to my coworkers while they're getting ready to go for a smoke^(Flagging themselves for break and that snazz in the phone system.) and we have a laugh about what a world of pain that boyfriend is going to be in.  \nA few minutes passes, and since my coworkers are all on break, I get the incoming call.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**--me:** &lt;standard greeting spiel that I can say in my sleep by now&gt;  \n**cbf:** Hi, you need to help me! My girlfriend is going crazy saying that I have some dating app on my phone! You need to tell her that it's a standard app that all operators install on their phones and not a dating app! *He sounds a bit echoy, kinda like he's on the toilet or something and I can hear the banging on a door and what sounds like #cgf shouting obscenities*  \n**--me:** Sir, are you a customer with us?  \n**cbf:** What? No, I'm with |competitor|.  \n**--me:** Then there isn't anything I can help you with. Because a) you're not our customer and b) I'm not going to lie to your girlfriend.  \n**cbf:** But you must! Come'on man! Help a brother out!  \n**--me:** Sorry sir, there's nothing I can do. *By now, I notice there's another call on hold waiting for an operator to be free* Unless there's anything regarding |operator|'s services I can help you with, I'm going to have to end this call since we have other customers waiting for help.  \n**cbf:** F@@K! *He hangs up*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n*I shrug and get ready to take the waiting call*  \n*Now my coworkers get back from the smoke break*  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**--me:** &lt;standard greeting spiel that I can say in my sleep by now&gt;  \n**cgf:** Ah, HI! Your the guy that I talked to earlier! Thank you so much for telling me what that Tinder app was! And if my boyfriend calls, please don't help him try to smooth this over or anything like that! I want that cheating bastard to squirm before I dump his sorry ass!  \n**--me:** *stunned silence*  \n**cgf:** Well, anyway! I just wanted to call and thank you for your help! Have a nice night!  \n*She hangs up*  \n*By now I'm putting myself on the after call status and relays the story to my coworkers that start laughing their asses off.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe did call in a few more times, landing with my coworkers, one of them he apparently even told that he was using Tinder to find girls to hookup with.  \nWhat happened to him?  \nDid his girlfriend get her hands on him?  \nI do not know, but I have a feeling that after that night he found himself kicked to the curb.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWell!

We get the business out of the way and get chatting about what we do for fun and it turns out we both have an interest in books (d'oh) so we spend another 10 minutes just going on about classic literature. It was just one of the nice chats today where I didn't have anyone shout down the telephone for no reason but someone who was being pleasant.\nThat is all. \n\n\nLove you guys!\n",

Every once in a blue moon we get patients calling in who are \"Friends of the University\" and a pop up box will notify us of such and advise us to \"handle with care.\" I've had this happen only one other time, but it was uneventful and everything turned out fine. A little different this time. Me is me, NDW is Name-Dropping Wife.\n\nMe: (*standard greeting, HIPAA, etc.*) Ok, and what is the reason for coming to the dermatology clinic?\n\nNDW: Well, I was just in the shower and noticed a black spot on my toe. I never noticed it before, because it's usually covered with nail polish, but I just saw it now and thought I should get it looked at. Do you have any cancellations for today or tomorrow?\n\nMe: Ok, lemme look at that. I know a little earlier today there were some appointments available, but those may have been taking. We can always check and hope that something else came up between then and now though!\n\n*masterful search input ensues*\n\nMe: Ok, well here we go, we have had a cancellation for tomorrow with a nurse practitioner, Nurse X, and they will be able to see you tomorrow at 3. \n\nNDW: Ok...you don't have anything available with a doctor for today?\n\nMe: I'm afraid not ma'am. My next one with a doctor is in September.\n\nNDW: Hmmm. You don't try to work in any sooner for dark spots? I used to be a nurse, and so I'm kinda concerned about it...\n\n(At this point, I've asked if there is any notable pain/sensations, bumps, etc. associated with the spot. There isn't. Sounds like it's just a burst capillary under the nail, very similar to one that I myself have at this exact moment.)\n\nMe: Well, my instruction is to offer what our first available is, and we do have something for tomorrow, but if you would like, I will send a message to the clinic and see if we can get you seen sooner.\n\nNDW: Would you? That would be great, because like I said, it's just that I have some concern that it could be a melanoma, and...well, I hate to bring this up, but I *am* the president's wife, President FancyPants at University, so if you think you could get me seen quickly, I would really appreciate it. \n\nMe: *eternal eye-rolling* Ok ma'am, I'll be sure and send a message to the clinic and let them know that you are wanting to be seen sooner than the appt with Nurse X for tomorrow...\n\nNDW: With a doctor, preferably.\n\nMe:..with a doctor, and we will give you a call back if there is something we can do. Now, did you want to go ahead and make the appointment for tomorrow with Nurse X just in case?\n\nNDW: Yes, I would. I'm a former nurse, so I know nurse practitioners are just as capable as doctors, and I would like to have an appointment anyway. \n\nMe: Ok, well, I have you scheduled for... (yadda, yadda, yadda, call wraps.)\n\nI sent the message detailing exactly how this went down, making sure to let the clinic know that this is a \"Friend of the University.\" \n\nI know people have a right to be concerned about their health, and I'm not trying to judge this lady for wanting to be seen for something that she thinks might be something serious, but honestly, this clinic stays pretty booked out. She had never been seen in the clinic before, and for a new patient to get something that soon is pretty incredible. The fact I offered that to her at all instead of someone on a Wait List who has been waiting for months to be worked in, is quite something. To take all that into consideration and then say, \"No, I'm a Someone, try and do more for me,\" just really irked me.  \n\nEDIT: I came back from lunch, and one of my co-workers told me that the lady called back to cancel the appointment because she realized it was probably just a bruise, and figured that someone else would need the appointment more. \n\n",

Sometimes our customers are capable to go through the process with us, while some others are less familiar with technical terms and such, in those cases, the nearby agent is there to help them with the wire. One day, I had a very interesting call, the agent felt like making a wire transfer himself, but didn't want to tell me, so he also pretended to be a customer...Me is me, CA is Cheating Agent.\n\nMe: Thank you for calling Wire Transfer Company, my name is escanor_hype, may I have the agency ID please?\n\nCA: Oh hey, it's me, First/Last Name, the agent, I'm calling from Agency ID, I have someone here that wants to make a transfer, I'm gonna leave him with you hold on... *sound of telephone simply being switched from one hand to the other*\n\nCA (pretending to be a customer): Hello?\n\nMe (suspicious of him sounding familiar to the agent): Hello, this is escanor_hype, I was told you want to make a wire transfer, right?\n\nCA (still pretending): Yeah, that's right.\n\nMe (knowing for sure it's the same guy, now that he spoke again): Okay then, may I have your name please?\n\nCA: Oh, it's the first time I'm sending so I'm not registered, but my name is First/Last name (same first name as the Agent, he just switched up his last name).\n\nI simply thought \"whatever\" to myself and proceeded with the transfer as I normally do, with the exception of muting my mic for a little bit after the \"customer\" first spoke to me. From the nature of the wires, chances are the agent gave a fake/incorrect last name when he assumed the role of agent, while he gave the legit last name once he assumed the role of a customer, as the transfer would never be able to clear if it didn't match his ID.",

        "text": "So I recently left call centre work, but this was one of the last calls I took. It was actually when I was acting as a supervisor for a day and one of the actual supervisors asked me to take a manager call for them (which I was happy to do) as they were neck deep in work.\n\n For context I was taking the call for a relatively new advisor (S) who had been speaking to the customer, who wanted to open an account but apparently had no ID we could accept after running through the checklist, and refused to take what they had into a branch to see if there was anything that could be done. Which is where I came in. Also there was no language barrier at all, I'm English and the customer had a clear English accent. \n\nMe - Hello, this is 2Fast, I believe you've been speaking with S today. As I understand it you're wanting to open an account with us, but you don't have the relevant ID? Is that correct?\n\nCustomer -  Yes, I want to use an account.\n\nM - Use an account? Do you mean open an account?\n\nC -  Use one, open one, what's the difference?\n\nM -  Well you can't just use an account, you have to open your account which you then use.\n\nC - Ok\n\nM -  I just want to check, did S run through our checklist with you of what we can take as ID?\n\nC - Yes\n\nM -  And there's nothing on there at all that you have?\n\nC - Nothing at all. \n\nM - Okay, as we do have certain rules on what we can and can't accept, and unless in branch they're willing to make an exception or a suggestion, which I can't guarantee they will, you would need more ID. For example, you could register on the electoral roll and next time you get a polling card you can use that as one form. \n\nC -  I want to open an account soon though, why can't I do it?\n\nM - Because it's our policy to require this, it's part of our security and anti fraud procedure to know our customers who we open accounts for. \n\nC - And who told you that?\n\nM - Sorry?\n\nC - Who told you that was the case?\n\nM - It's company policy, and I don't remember who would have told me that, though it doesn't change that it's policy. \n\nC -  But who told you?\n\nM - I can't answer that in all honesty as I don't remember exactly when I learned about the ID policy, I've been with the company nearly 2 years and there are various things I've learned at various times. And unfortunately it doesn't change the policy. \n\nC - So who can make an exception\n\nM - Nobody over the phone can do, you'll have to show what you do have to someone in branch to see if they can arrange something different. \n\nC - Can your manager make an exception?\n\nM - As I said, nobody over the phone can do that. \n\nC - I'd like to speak to them, and if they can't do it, I want to speak to their manager.\n\nM - I'll go speak to my manager now and explain the situation to them\n\n(Speak to manager, she says she won't come to the phone (quite rightly) so asks me to offer to log a complaint (which S had already offered to do) if C is not happy with our policy. I return to the phone)\n\nM - Hello C, thanks for holding. I've spoken to my manager and as already stated, nobody over the phone can change the policy, so they won't be coming to the phone. They have asked, like S already offered, if you'd like to log a complaint about this?\n\nC - Will it change the policy?\n\nM - I'm afraid not\n\nC - Can I get your name, number and your turret number (that was unusual as the turret is what we call our inbound phones and they have a 7 digit phone number that's only used internally). \n\nM - I've already given you my first name, can I ask what you need my staff number and turret number for?\n\nC - I'm going to take this to court, so I need those details so they can access this call later. Are you prepared to swear that you're certain this is bank policy, it's perjury if you lie. \n\n(We then went back on forth about whether or not to give my details, I only actually obliged in the end as I knew I was already leaving the bank, and I also have a very common name, so I wasn't worried, I mainly didn't want to set a precedent)\n\nM - I'll give you my details though I would like to inform you that we're not obliged to do so. And should this go to court I'll be happy to state that this is bank policy to the best of my knowledge. I don't believe even if I was mistaken that it would be perjury, as right now I've not said anything under oath, and if I was in court and I was wrong, that would be a mistake, not a lie. \n\nC - Well when I see you in court we'll see what the judge says, I'm taking it down there tomorrow and they will take your bank to court and you will swear it in front of a judge. \n\nM - Should it come to that I'm more than happy to state what I said again. Are you sure you don't want to log a complaint, or don't want to head into a branch to see if they can work something out? I'm happy to go through the list again or email a branch manager to make them aware you're coming in?\n\nC - No, I'll be going to court with this. Goodbye\n\n\nTL:DR - Woman threatens legal action over not having the right ID, seems to forget she will need to prove who she is to the courts to be able to do so. And I was not going to remind her.

Most customers take it fine and get that they just called a company so they need information to pull up their system. I do this so often that the act has become kind of numb, I don't really equate the numbers they give me with phone numbers anymore or the implications asking for a phone number carries. Very very rarely someone doesn't get it and will say something like \"phone number?\" and i'll clarify \"yes sir/ma'am I'll need a phone number so I can pull up your account on my system.\" then usually they get it. Until one day someone didn't understand it, Me is me, TP is Totally Presumptuous. \n\nMe: Hey thanks for calling Alarm Company, could I get your name please?\n\nTP: My name is Totally Presumptuous and I need help with my alarm system.\n\nMe: Alright, I can certainly assist you with that, now just to make sure I get your preferred name is it alright if I call you Totally during this call? \n\nTP: No, that will be Ms. Presumptuous for you.\n\nMe: Ok Ms. Presumptuous, could I go ahead and get the phone number on your account?\n\nTP: Excuse me, why do you want my phone number?\n\nMe: I'll need the phone number on your account so I can go ahead and pull up your system Ma'am.\n\nTP: Hm, I haven't needed it in the past when I've called in.\n\nMe: Perhaps you're calling from a different phone than normal, or potentially the system just didn't pull it up. I could use your address to pull it up if you'd prefer. \n\nTP: Humph! Whats your name?\n\nMe: My name is DECtape, ma'am.\n \nTP: Well, DECtape, I'll have you know I already have a boyfriend and we're very close.\n\nAt this point I hear TP say something about men and pigs under her breath.\n\n\nRemember how I said I'm sort of numb to the fact that I ask people for their phone number so often? I wasn't joking at this point its just another thing I need to get from customers like their verbal passcode and their name. One of our big stats is empathizing with the customer and doing smalltalk when a customer initiates it, I barely use higher brain functions and pretty much zone out most of the day now so I figured the customer was making small talk at this point and just without thinking dropped out my canned reply to a question like that. \n\nMe: Oh that's great to hear ma'am. So do I, my boyfriend and I just celebrated being together for a year, love sure is a great thing. Now real quick could I get that phone number from you so I can pull up your account?\n\n&lt;brief silence&gt;\n\nTP: Oh... uh. oh...\n\n&lt;brief silence and some shuffling&gt;\n\nTP: The phone number on my account is 555-555-5555.",
