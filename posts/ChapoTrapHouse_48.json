What is this in reference to? \n\n&gt;**CL**: Yes, I felt the Sanders candidacy also showed that—particularly since back in the ’90s, when I was at *In These Times*, Bernie Sanders wrote for us, since he was then the only socialist member of Congress, and had these kind of sad-sack dispatches about his doomed efforts to nudge the Clinton administration to the left. The thought that he’d ever one day be a credible candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination—I never would have believed that in a million years back then.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**AG**: And look, if Bernie had been twenty years younger, a person of color, **or**—from what I hear—**a kinder man at an interpersonal level, if he’d treated his workers the way his policies indicated he should have**—I think that could have ended very differently. It just tells you that there’s fertile ground right now for an age of reform. And you can’t just look at the people who are there right now. I think there’s plenty of evidence that the seeds of that are waiting to be harvested. But it takes some harvesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I just don't understand how it's acceptable to mock an entire country and culture like that, it fucking pisses me off.

Rick Scott absolutely will do just that as he stacks the Florida Supreme Court with three more wingnut justices on his last day as governor.\n\nAnd if he fires Rosenstein, then Sessions and Mueller, this will ensure he lasts to 2020, and don't let liberal analysts and pundits tell you otherwise. This is what drives me crazy about Cenk. He's got great political instincts, but he's not Michael Moore; he does not get that firing Rosenstein will help Trump in the end as he chips away at the corruption probe.\n\nThis dude said Trump will resign before the midterms. He said Republicans will not win a single election after 2020. I seriously think he's experiencing confirmation bias. Can hope for the future and a faith in the system break your brain with optimism overload? Michael Moore's like \"lolno, Democrats will never run progressives and Trump will absolutely crush them in the Rust Belt which is all he needs.\"",
