They asked me to have a technical interview in the form of CTF for 3 hours long (Windows Machine). Any recommendations on what to practice and where? Any recommended boxes on Tryhackme or HTB? \n\nPS: I am eJPT certified, and I know some stuff in general. I practice in THM a lot, but still I believe that I am just in the beginning. \n\nThank you in advance",

In short (and in military terms), to take a hit and keep fighting. \n\nYou can help with this important research! I am seeking participants for my online survey to better understand the innovation-decision process for cyber resiliency, and what influences affect adoption or rejection of cyber resiliency innovations at the organizational leadership level. Participants should be mid-senior level cybersecurity professionals with more than 5 years of field experience. \n\nThe survey should take no longer than 15 minutes to complete (tested by pilot); you will remain anonymous. There's an option for a live interview at the end, please consider it as it will help enrich the data collected!

        "text": "Hey, all. I’m okay versed in computers, but I’m nothing fancy—the extent of my meanderings might be setting up arch Linux in VM or Debian on old laptops I don’t know the password to. Recently my Mac ran into some issues and I believe them to be coming from a USB3 to HDMI cord from amazon. \n\nImmediately after plugging in the cord I experienced massive changes in my GUI. The crispness of windows was lost, i had different cursors, and I could resize windows only x and y axis— losing the ability to size diagonally. I was in photoshop at the time and it kept wanting to crash, but before the cord I’d had no problems. \n\nThings seemed so funky. The environment was reminiscent of being in a virtual machine or booting an ISO image from a flash drive. After seeing if settings would aid me in returning to normalcy, I inevitably accepted defeat and system wiped and reset. \n\nBooting up afterwards it very much seemed like more code than the original injection from the USB was implemented. It went from the worst replication of Apple’s OS I’ve ever seen to Generic Apple Light. \n\nI’ve managed to see the original MacOS only once since plugging the cord into the computer, and that was booting into safe mode after a complete loss of power from letting the battery die. \n\nI suspect the laptop isn’t even turning off completely, but whatever is occurring— it really keeps guiding me into connecting to the WiFi and starting again. I have tried accessing the UEFI/BIOS, entering recovery mode, etc… to no avail. \n\nPlaying with some other macs for reference, it appears this suspected infected Mac is skipping about two or three questions regarding date and time or whatever else for initial setup and instead immediately wants to connect to the internet again. \n\nI want the infected Mac to work again, as it had about a terabyte of HDD and other hardware that made it better at running VMs than any other computer I have available. Unfortunately, from a preliminary google I think I’m dealing with a “rootkit” or something else that hijacked it. \n\nWhat are some computer analytical means of safely seeing what may have been done? Can I hook a Debian laptop up to the infected cord and see if there’s anything out of the ordinary without putting that laptop at risk? I would presume hooking up another Mac to either the cord or the infected laptop would be a no go. Is there a way to use a VM to safely access suspect USBs without their contents infecting the host? \n\n\nAny and all armchair advice and brainy banter on the matter is welcomed. I’d take suggestions on everything from how to safely repurpose the computer components, to what network commands to run on the router to keep alert about all traffic after this attack, or even tips on wire stripping the cord to look for hidden data devices.",

        "text": "A few days ago, while browsing 4chan on my android phone (using Google Chrome), I suddenly got redirected to a shady website called luckypapa dot top. Fortunately, that website didn't have the \"https\" thingie (the security certificate or whatever) and so Chrome didn't actually open the website, instead it showed me the usual warning for websites without https (\"your connection is not private/secure/whatever\").\n\n\n\nAt first I thought that maybe I had accidentally clicked in one of 4chan's ads. A few days ago, I visited 4chan again, and I was redirected to the same shady website again. This time I'm sure I didn't click any ad, so I guess 4chan is infected. I haven't returned to 4chan since then.\n\n\n\nThis redirect only happened in 4chan. I visited other websites and I had no problem. After googling about this issue, I read somewhere that it might be a malicious cookie or something, so I deleted Chrome's cookies, cache, and history (as a consequence, I had to login again in multiple websites... I hope there isn't a keylogger or spyware or whatever collecting my passwords!). \n\n\n\nLater I scanned my phone with the following free antivirus apps: Malwarebytes, Lookout, ESET Security, Bitdefender Antivirus Free, Kaspersky, and Intercept X Sophos. None of them detected any malware, though Intercept X says two system apps are \"PUA\" (potentially unwanted apps - but they're system apps, so I'm unable to uninstall them) and said another app had low reputation (ironically that's a government app for processing my taxes and other stuff). But Intercept X had already said the exact same things the other times I scanned my device, months ago, so these results are nothing new.\n\n\nDoes this mean my phone and my Chrome app are safe? My phone is not rooted and I haven't installed any new app recently. I checked my downloads folder and there's no APK file or anything shady. Should I worry or not?",

Once I have a huge subdomain file list, what's the most efficient way to work the subdomains moving into port reconnaissance?\n\nIve used some online tools that allow you to paste subdomains and it'll give you the IP.

        "text": "Hi all, \n\nHoping to get some advice. I would like to switch positions and work in a malware analyst or reverse-engineering role and was wondering if getting the GREM certification would be helpful in landing a job. \n\nI previously worked as a security consultant, red team member, tech writer, and, most currently, as product owner for an identity provider startup. I've come to dread working as a manager and get stressed and depressed every time I see myself being added to another meeting so I think some kind of change is necessary.\n\nMost of my technical work experience has been security-focused, though not on malware. More using tools such as burp suite, cobalt strike, nessus, IBM app scan, and other VA/pentesting tools. And writing reports. Lots of reports. \n\nI have some personal RE experience - I used to be active on some forums and progressed to recovering the RC4 keys of zeus variants and things like that, though my skills might be a bit rusty. I know enough x86/ia64 assembly to not be totally lost when using binary ninja, ghidra, or ida.  \n\nI don't know if malware analyst/RE positions have hiring challenges similar to other netsec positions and I am not 100% sure what to expect. This leads me to ask - is getting the GREM cert worthwhile for landing a job? I would be paying for it out of pocket. I haven't decided whether or not I'd pay for the course or just try and pass the cert on my own. I don't have much experience with malicious macros, but I have dabbled in VBA a bit in the past. \n\nI do not have a college degree and cannot see myself finishing one at this point. I burned through 10 years of my GI Bill switching majors instead of just finishing something. So far the lack of degree  hasn't hurt me too much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post - but if anyone has any insight, or can share their personal experience with a similar situation it would greatly appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

I realize that the market is tough right now  and that I'm very fortunate to be having the opportunities that I have  right now especially as I am leaving college. I hope that my post  doesn't come off in any way as bragging/ungrateful or anything like  that. I just simply want more opinions on what I should do.\n\nSo I have two Internship offers for my final summer in University.\n\nThe first one is for Crowdstrike and it is as an analyst for their Falcon Complete product.\n\nThe second one is for IBM and it is for their penetration testing team.\n\nIn  terms of my career I really would like to go down the red team route,  but I fear that I may be missing out on a big opportunity by not working  with Crowdstrike. It seems like a lot of people have positive things to  say about them and they are a pretty big name in the industry. I think I  remember one redditor saying that they would work for them for free if  they had the chance or something.\n\nBut  I have a slight/moderate dissatisfaction towards the role, I did  forensics at another internship last summer and I can't really see  myself doing that for years. It's a cool field, but I just don't think  its for me.\n\nThere is also the  prospect of lay offs. Apparently there is supposed to be more layoffs  around the time I'm supposed to start, so I fear that my offer may be  pulled from one or the other. A couple of people in my life, have told  me to accept both offers, but then just renege one of them like a week  before the start dates, but doing this will for sure burn bridges and I  believe that is pretty unwise especially this early in my career.\n\nAny advice on how I should approach this situation?",

Apparently you stick them into phones to charge and they look like regular usbc cables from Apple or usb sticks into computer ports and they do things like key logging and whatever. The site says they do things like keystroke injection (duckyscript), mouse injection, payload slots, self destruct, geofencing, Wi-Fi trigger, full speed usb hardware keylogger, convert data exfil, and networked c2. Idk what any of this means I’m just transcribing. Anyway, does this mean like if you plug one of these into your iPhone or computer they download viruses and keyloggers forever and your device has it like herpes or is it only when it’s plugged in it can read and see what’s going on and why hasn’t Apple done anything about this? Same question applies to usb drives. And how can I counteract this? I heard you can disable the usb drive on your computer at least so it. Just doesn’t recognize the usb. Thanks!",

        "text": "Hi /r/netsec! Over the last month or so, I've received a handful of SMS messages that seem to be 2FA-related, and that I don't recognize (and didn't request myself). I'm wondering whether I should be worried, and if so how I should best proceed.\n\nThe SMS messages are from the number 59872 and are formatted as follows:\n\n&gt; ALERT! DO NOT share this code with anyone. We will never ask you for this code. Verification Code:\n&gt;\n&gt; XXXXXX (expires in 3 minutes)\n\n(X's represent the redacted code.)\n\nAround the same time as one of these message, I also received one phone call (not answered) from +1 (714) 707-3260 with caller ID \"Verify\", along with a voice message that just says 4 digits and then \"Goodbye\".\n\nI can think of a few possibilities for what's going on:\n\n1. Someone has my password for some service, and they're trying to gain access to my account\n2. Someone is mistakenly using my phone number for 2FA - either when trying to register, or when trying to login (if the service doesn't require verifying the phone number during registration)\n3. The messages are bogus, and are intended to scare me or convince me to message/call back so the sender can perhaps try other social engineering techniques\n\n2 and 3 aren't so bad, but I'd really like to try to eliminate the possibility of 1. I've logged in to each of my \"mission critical\" accounts (important email accounts, banking, work-related stuff) and confirmed that none of those accounts send 2FA messages in the format written above. (In fact, most 2FA SMS messages include the sending service's name.) Still, I don't have an exhaustive list of my accounts that might have my phone number associated to them, and so I'm worried that I might be missing something.\n\nSo that leaves me with a couple questions:\n\n1. Is there any way to identify the phone numbers and/or the format of the messages I posted above, so that I might find out which of my accounts (if any) is under attack?\n2. Are there any other actions I should take in general? (For one, I've made sure that I'm enabling 2FA only via authenticator app where possible, but sadly some services always allow SMS 2FA.)\n\nThanks in advance!",

The way these work is you would go to a /sign up endpoint and place an SQL statement in the password field basically signing up with the password ROBERT'); --DROP TABLE Students;-- typically it would immediately break the site upon sign up but most sign up forms are sanitized so it saves them temporarily however if we go to say an /updateprofile endpoint and the password is used in a SELECT statement unsanitized the tables would drop at this point. The key here is consistency and devs could easily make an off by one error and forget to escape one endpoint/page that's all it takes for a second order injection to drop up. I'm more surprised people just care about the passwords themselves being the issue and not the entire sites integrity there's like barely any discussion on this.",

        "text": "Hi /r/AskNetsec, I'm the lone security engineer at an 800 person organization and I'm feeling overwhelmed. Here are my high level responsibilities:\n\n* **Security architecture and engineering.** Building and improving our SIEM (no time to monitor, investigate, and close alerts), implementing recommendations to harden our cloud environment, proposing and implementing new configurations (like DLP and MDM)\n* **Compliance.** SOC compliance, GDPR, CCPA, contracts, policy, third-party questionnaires, security and awareness training\n* **Identity and access management.** Creating and updating conditional access, improving/troubleshooting MFA, secrets management, privileged identity management\n* **Vulnerability management.** Remediating vulnerabilities on our endpoints and in the cloud, patching workstations, inspecting phishing emails, responding to alerts\n* **Professional development.** I want to earn my CISSP (to negotiate a higher salary) and eventually become a threat hunter. In addition to all of the work above, I've earned other certifications, on average two every six months\n\nI cannot do all of this on my own. I recently asked for an assistant to handle the compliance function so I can handle the technical work and the request was rejected (but we *can* hire new sales folks). This makes me feel discouraged. What's also discouraging is how hard it is to grow professionally; I have to help architect and maintain our expanding and dynamic infrastructure. \n\nThere are numerous and significant alerts in any one of our various security and compliance portals and I cannot oversee and remediate on top of everything else on my plate. What's more, I sometimes get bogged down with tier one tickets like, \"Is this a phishing email?\", \"Please reset my password\", and \"Help! My authenticator doesn't work. Can we get on a call?\"\n\nMy manager, while a great guy, has a new idea every week which gets added to my backlog. Tasks are being added faster than I can check them off. His, \"Hey, you know what would be nice?\" attitude frustrates me. Plenty of ideas. No one to help. When I expressed my frustration, he came back with, \"Well, IT isn't getting help either, and they need it too.\" A non-answer. When I ask what my career trajectory at the organization is like, he says it's unpredictable, and that I should define it. Help me out here, dude.\n\nOur system administrators are great and they pitch in when they can; they're a fantastic group, but they have their own work to do. Similarly, we have a multitude of security champions on the consulting side of the business, but helping me would be charity--beyond that there's not much incentive.\n\nWhile we've made significant strides since I've onboarded, there are gaping holes in our infrastructure. For example, cloud engineers create VMs whose ports are exposed to the internet, and recently one was brute forced, and I had to fix it. Basic security protocols like encrypting cloud resources aren't followed, and I have to pick up the pieces.\n\nI'm worried I'll be stuck in this loop until we get acquired by a much larger company (the goal), then given breadcrumbs even though I'm doing 3x jobs and being ground into dust. Worse, I'm worried we'll suffer a breach and I'll be held accountable. Finally, I don't want to spend the rest of my life changing people's passwords and closing false positives. I want to flourish in the cybersecurity space.\n\nWhat do I do?",
