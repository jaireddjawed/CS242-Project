I will also by that point have 1 year of experience as a resource consent planner at Auckland Council. \n\n1.\tWould it be possible for me to work in the United Kingdom as planner once I graduate?\n2.\tIf so are there any resources available for learning UK planning regulations ahead of time so that I can mention that in my CV\n3.\tAny other anecdotes or advice about planners moving overseas would be very much appreciated!\n\nAgain apologies if this is not the correct forum for this kind of inquiry.

        "text": "**CONTEXT:**\n\nI own a bike shop in Brookfield, WI a suburb of Milwaukee, WI. Like many American suburbs built up mostly between 1960-1990, the vast majority of land use is single-family housing.\n\nI also own the real estate where the bike shop is, a 1.5-acre parcel on the corner of a 6-lane state highway which is a local artery and a few miles west of an interstate highway.\n\nThe building we are in is functionally obsolete, and I've stopped making major investments in maintenance  (HVAC, roofing, etc) anticipating some sort of redevelopment. My primary goal is to solve for building a new space for the bike shop. A single-use new construction building for a new bike shop is not economically viable--additional revenue into the project is needed to support the costs of construction.\n\nIn 2021, I bought the adjacent property which was a former gas station to make a 2-acre parcel.\n\nThe City's own 2050 Comprehensive Plan calls for redevelopment of the node into higher-density, mixed use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PROJECT:**\n\nTaking the lead from the City's own Comprehensive Plan, I'm working with a developer to re-imagine the site as a retail/residential mixed-use property with design cues taken from more modern standards in terms of smaller setbacks, putting parking in the rear or below grade, and creating a more engaging site. In order to overcome some of the financial challenges overcoming environmental remediation associated with the site, and to hit overall economic viability hurdles, the pro forma requires \\~75 residential units in addition to the \\~25,000 of retail space.\n\nThe design has gone through several iterations in the attempt to allay some concerns from the public (traffic, building height, aesthetics). Where we've arrived is essentially the minimum viable product.\n\nThe City staff have been generally supportive as the project conforms to the Comprehensive Plan and checks a lot of boxes:\n\n* Retain a local business\n* Clean up an environmentally degraded site\n* Add to the diversity of housing stock\n* Add to the tax base (at least 10x)\n* Improve the aesthetics of an otherwise unattractive property\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONTROVERSY:**\n\nThe projects has generated some opposition from a small, though determined group of immediate neighbors. Their stated concerns (valid or not) are:\n\n* Building height: Somehow, a 58' structure is unappealing. For context, the residential neighborhoods in the general vicinity are a mix of 1-story and 2-story homes on 0.5-acre+ lots.\n* Housing stock: 90%+ of the residential units in the City are single-family homes. There is a certain distaste or fear for any sort of apartments.\n* Traffic: Fear that 75 apartments will materially increase and adversely affect traffic in the area. Keep in mind, this project is on a 6-lane highway. The traffic study concluded there would be no loss of throughput on the highway as a result of the project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WEAK-WILLED COMMON COUNCIL:**\n\nEven though City staff are supportive, the Mayor is supportive, and the project conforms to the City's own comprehensive plan, approval from the Common Council is still required. The 14 members of the Common Council are roughly split, and it seems the opposition is mostly a result of the influence of the small, though vocal contingent of NIMBYist neighbors. The lack of vision, progress, and compromise is extremely frustrating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HELP ME REDDIT!**\n\nI am not a professional developer, I am a bike shop owner just trying to keep the business relevant for years to come. I want to stay in the location, and this project is the best way to keep us there and viable. \n\nI need help to combat the loud NIMBYists that show up to every meeting, threaten the Alders with recalls and political retributions, and elevate their own self interests. I'm looking for tactics, arguments, or other ideas to help the Alders understand the big picture and approve this project\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome links about the project:\n\n* Project details (Wheel &amp; Sprocket): [https://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/709/Development-Projects](https://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/709/Development-Projects)\n* NIMBY: An actual Karen: [https://www.fox6now.com/news/brookfield-wheel-sprocket-proposal-dispute](https://www.fox6now.com/news/brookfield-wheel-sprocket-proposal-dispute)\n* News articles:\n* [https://www.gmtoday.com/the\\_freeman/business/brookfield-plan-commission-divided-on-mixed-use-proposal/article\\_1315276e-036e-11ed-92f7-1fdab45e7209.html](https://www.gmtoday.com/the_freeman/business/brookfield-plan-commission-divided-on-mixed-use-proposal/article_1315276e-036e-11ed-92f7-1fdab45e7209.html)\n* [https://www.gmtoday.com/the\\_freeman/business/developers-revise-brookfield-wheel-sprocket-proposal/article\\_58606e1c-5d16-11ed-b0f3-5714553f3a71.html](https://www.gmtoday.com/the_freeman/business/developers-revise-brookfield-wheel-sprocket-proposal/article_58606e1c-5d16-11ed-b0f3-5714553f3a71.html)\n* [https://www.gmtoday.com/the\\_freeman/business/brookfield-council-addresses-two-housing-projects/article\\_20f1d496-97fb-11ed-868a-83011aebb676.html](https://www.gmtoday.com/the_freeman/business/brookfield-council-addresses-two-housing-projects/article_20f1d496-97fb-11ed-868a-83011aebb676.html)",

I was pleasantly surprised to pay just 4.10€ for a metro + train ride to a city 20km away. Later it got even better with dedicated bike lanes even in the smaller cities (50k), and walkable city centers. \n\nI know that all these good things are not that common and just wanted to make a post of appreciation for this great city, I also invite you to checkout what I saw on your own as the relation from the trip is uploaded [here](https://youtu.be/R-X6VBHTYKQ).",

If they only have 2, should the crosswalk be on the left or the right (see photo) - I am in the US, so this is for places where you drive on the right side of the road. Basically if a car is driving towards the T intersection and needs to make either a right or left turn, should the crosswalk be in the path of a driver making a left turn, in the path of a driver making a right turn, or on both sides? \n\nThere have been some pedestrian incidents at a specific crosswalk in our town, and we are hoping to speak with the town board about some changes to make it safer.

This field was created with JJ's Death and Life, and is the study of the every day, of the \"normal\" things which contribute to the public life of a place and make it feel more \"alive\".\n\n I am searching for foundational texts in the field, and currently have the following list: \n\n* Death &amp; Life (JJ)\n* A Theory of Good City form (Lynch)\n* Timeless Way of Building (Alexander)\n* Cities for People/Spaces Between Buildings (Gehl)\n* Livable Streets (Appleyard)\n* Happy City (Montgomery)\n\nDo you know of any other texts related to the field (significant or otherwise)? Are there any contemporary advancements in this field you think worthy of attention? I've noticed a huge amount of papers coming out of China recently using big data to map urban vibrancy (ex. http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020525), which I feel has in part to do with how different their privacy laws are from the west.",

        "text": "A bill giving the legislature control of the roads ringing the Idaho State Capitol is marching ahead to the House floor. \n\nOn Monday, the House Transportation Committee unanimously approved HB 25 brought by Rep. Joe Palmer, R-Meridian, that would require the Director of the Idaho Department of Administration to approve any changes to the roads around the capitol that exceed a week. The approval must be done in consultation with the Governor, the Idaho State Capitol Commission, and the leaders of the Idaho Legislature. \n\nPalmer said this bill is important to ensure the Capitol’s safety and security. \n\n“There’s a lot of different security situations that could arise because of the type of work that could go on in the county and we need to make it a more secure place and the people who best suit that would be the Capitol Commission and the governor and the legislature. It does give last authority for those roads to the state.”\n\nThis bill could also put the parking meters in the area under the legal control of the State of Idaho. \n\nWhat about two-way traffic?\nThis bill comes as discussions about converting 5th and 6th Streets to two-way traffic are heating up again after laying dormant since 2019. \n\nAs previously reported by BoiseDev, joint meetings between the City of Boise, the Ada County Highway District, and urban renewal agency Capital City Development Corporation have worked out a cost-sharing agreement to start the conversion. 6th Street runs along the east side of the Idaho State Capitol, putting that one block segment in the state’s orbit if this bill passes. \n\nThe legislation says: “The director shall consult with the governor, the presiding officers of the legislature, and the Idaho state capitol commission prior to granting or withholding approval of an alteration of the use of the roadways exceeding seven (7) days.”\n\nAny potential impacts to the two-way traffic plan were not discussed in the hearing to pass the bill on Monday. Calls to Palmer and to the City of Boise asking about the potential impacts of the two-way traffic plan were not returned in time for the publication of this story. \n\nThe local agencies and the Idaho Transportation Dept. have differed about the decision, with ITD saying last fall it did not support the conversion. 5th &amp; 6th street intersect with Front St. &amp; Myrtle St., which are controlled by the state.",

The city of Oxford is planning to trial splitting the city into 15 minute zones - this has turned into a big conspiracy in my part of Canada where people are convinced the government will use this to implement climate lockdowns and force us to stay in our zones. It's all very dumb and embarrassing.\n\nHowever, while looking into what Oxford is actually doing, I came across [this page](https://www.oxford.gov.uk/news/article/2332/joint_statement_from_oxfordshire_county_council_and_oxford_city_council_on_oxford_s_traffic_filters) which says the following:\n\n&gt; The traffic filters are not physical barriers of any kind and will not be physical road closures. They are simply traffic cameras that can read number plates. \nIf a vehicle passes through the filter at certain times of the day, the camera will read the number plate and (if you do not have an exemption or a residents’ permit) you will receive a fine in the post.\n\nThere are exceptions, purchasable permits, and things like that, but the general idea is if you cross the zone line, you get a ticket. Does anyone have experience with something like this? Does it result in much confusion? I find it difficult to imagine people responding well to getting a ticket for crossing an imaginary line, even if they are well meaning and generally support the plan.",

I know those electives made kids aware of job opportunities that they may not have realized before.  I've long thought that urban planning would be a great elective for this age group.  High Schoolers are that age when they are really becoming aware of themselves and their place in the world, and asking hard questions about why our society and lives are structured the way they are.  \n\nI think offering them a class in urban planning would open their eyes to things they did not even know they were struggling with while equipping them with the knowledge to speak out with eloquence.  The issues of having a third place, being able to walk easily to locations like friend/family/store, environmentalism, etc are absolutely things that impact them and already care about.  And as they learn and come to care about these issues there will be a portion of their parents that will care as well.  Finally, no one cares more about a community than the people living there.  I think offering these classes could spark a lot of great debate and action in communities that desperately need it but are too small to catch the notice of large organizations.\n\n* What subjects would you like to see in a class like this?\n* How would you like to see it covered?\n* How much community engagement would you like to see?\n* Would you approve of state and federal grants for schools to offer these classes?\n\nI found some interesting examples of similar projects across the US, I'll include the links here.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-05-24/the-high-school-curriculum-every-urban-planner-wishes-they-d-had\nhttp://urbandesignlab.columbia.edu/innovative-modules-of-urban-studies-for-high-school-students/\nhttps://americas.uli.org/programs/urbanplan/urbanplan-high-schools/\n\n\nI'm just curious to hear your thoughts on what I think is an opportunity we are missing.",

        "text": "People on this sub are probably familiar with Walkscore. For those who aren't, Walkscore is a site that assigns a 0-100 indexed score for an address or a neighborhood. The score is based on how many goods and services you can walk to from a given address (they aggregate up to neighborhood and citywide averages). \n\nI find Walkscore useful for getting a general sense of a place. But it doesn't necessarily key in to the things that I want to walk to. It includes some categories that are no longer important to me (like schools) or that I don't expect to walk to (like clothing scores), and some things that I wouldn't include.  So I decided to make up my own Walkscore formula. What would yours be?\n\nI'd look at what was within a 3/4 mile walk radius, because that's about my maximum reasonable walk distance. YMMV.\n\n.First off, I'd combine **Transit** into the Walkscore, because transit allows you to have walk access all over the city. I weight transit at **25** points. I don't include bikability because I'm not a cyclist, but you could.\n\nHere's how I would distribute the remaining 75 points:\n\n**Grocery Stores--25**. I'd include all kinds ofgrocery stores, including  specialties (e.g. bakeries) andvconvenience stores, but exclude liquor stores that don't really sell much food;\n\n**Restaurants--15.** I'd exclude national chain restaurants. There are certain cuisines I like better  than others, but that gets complicated.\n\n**Coffee-10.**\n\n**Bars--5**, though personally I'm interested in bars that serve quality beer;\n\n**Entertainment--5.** Movies, live theatre, concert venues, museums. These are all great, but I don't necessarily expect them within walking distance;\n\n**Parks--5.** Parks are great too, but I use a lot that aren't within walking distance;\n\n**Drug Stores--5.** They're important but not specifically called out in Walkscore;\n\n**Book and publication access--5.**  Mostly I want a public library, but a bookstore or a newsstand would be great too.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nOnce again I find myself on reddit at work. \n\nI have a very US-specific question here. I'm trying to understand how the planning decision making process works in rural US counties (preferably in the Western United States). For context, I'm working on a transportation planning project and it would be useful to have a better understanding of the dynamics before starting it. I'm used to working in an urban environment with much more in the way of resources, staff, engagement efforts, a \"clear\" political landscape, etc. \n\n\\- Who are the key actors? Commissioners, mayors, state DOTs, etc. \n\n\\- Do these actors engage with the process in a more formal or informal way? \n\n\\- Does planning often happen with significant engagement of smaller towns when implementing regional projects? Does it remain more centralized and removed? \n\n\\- Do towns generally have enough resources to plan their own projects, or do they outsource this work to state agencies? \n\nI realize the answers to these may vary widely by region, so even just a patchwork of understanding of different places might point me in the right direction. Additionally, if anyone doesn't have an answer but a good set of resources to turn to, being pointed in the direction of those would be much appreciated. If you have any questions, I'll happily answer them in the chat! Thank you!",

Lots of knowledgeable people here. \n\nSo, when I say “good” small towns, I mean places that have maintained a traditional (or mostly traditional) pattern of development, are free from the domination of corporate chains over local business, and are safe with low crime rates. I know, sounds a little too perfect to be real. But what do you guys think? Can you think of any places that are walkable, safe, and largely free of commercial chains? \n\nIf not, what about places that are just walkable and safe?
