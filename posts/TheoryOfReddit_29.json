It is currently #1 on /r/all with 5000 score as I write this.\n\nWhat does this suggest about the nature of people who go on /r/news? Does it suggest most people merely upvote/downvote based on the title, with no attempt to actually clicking on the article? Anyone who read Post 1 would have understood the key points of the article. I think Post 2 had a greater effect because people browsing /new could easily see the findings of the article without reading it, so it is a more *effortless* upvote. This, combined with the reddit hivemind of upvoting anything regarding invasion of privacy, likely resulted in the posts success.\n\nThere is another possibility, regarding the timing of the post. I think that it was posted at *just* the right time because people start waking up in the U.S. (esp. east coast) and it was time for the news sub to pick a new *front-runner* for the front page. This is easier to do in the beginning of the day because this is when fresh content is starting to be posted to reddit, and posts from the previous night start to make their way down /r/all because they are older.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "My PhD dissertation, **Upvoting the News: Breaking News Aggregation, Crowd Collaboration, and Algorithm-Driven Attention on reddit.com,** is now available publicly via Creative Commons license online: \n\nhttp://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15799coll40/id/297862\n\nThe dissertation is broken down into 4 primary analysis chapters:\n\n* Ch. 4: Motivations and Values for Peer Information Aggregation (who reports on breaking news and why)\n* Ch. 5: The Practices of Peer Information Aggregation (what people do when they aggregate breaking news information on reddit)\n* Ch. 6: Collaboration &amp; Coordination (how people work together to report on breaking news)\n* Ch. 7: Roles and Designs: Platform Gatekeeping &amp; Visibility (how reddit's technical and social design impacts visibility of information)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nWith the increase in adoption of social media platforms for consuming news, ordinary people are also using these spaces to share original information or recirculate published news. While former projects like WikiNews failed in their attempt to create social systems for working together to compile information about news events, more recent systems build on the scale and connectedness of online social communities to allow people to do similar work. How then do people come together in networked sociotechnical systems to collaborate on the peer production of news? This dissertation looks at the practices of peer information aggregation, where individuals and large groups collaborate in the collection and redistribution of information from social media platforms and mainstream media organizations in response to developing events. It uses the case study of reddit.com, a social news site, where participants may contribute links and information from around the internet and rank those contributions through voting, filtering algorithms, and commenting. Using the lens of network gatekeeping, the dissertation explores how individual decision-making, group dynamics, and system design impact what information is included or rejected in the process of providing audiences information about ongoing news events. Through the analysis of more than 50 ethnographic interviews and participant observation, situated in a 2+ billion message historical trace data corpus, I explore the values, decisions, and politics of peer information aggregation in response to local and global crises. While the results demonstrate that participants have little experience doing information work, their ideals resemble those of journalists. However, the complicated technical limitations of reddit’s platform, the dependence on information from mainstream media organizations, the varying levels of explicit coordination within groups, and the politics of moderators and administrators significantly shape the possibilities of successful peer information production.",

Conspiracy theories all around. Then I saw this post:\n\n&gt; So thats three people with ties to [candidate] or the [party]...\nAll in three months.\nI doubt very much [candidate] or the [party] had anything to do with it. But it does look awfully suspicious, especially given the circumstances.\n\nI've seen a *lot* of these posts lately. The formula is the same: the person spends 2/3rds of the post listing suspicious happenings and otherwise *insinuating* a conspiracy... only to immediately distance him/herself from that belief. This separates the belief from the person--thus giving the poster the appearance of objectivity and transparency. This makes the belief more palatable to others. \n\nLet me list a controversial example. \n\nIn one scenario, Roger the Redditor says: \n\n&gt;Stats 'r' Us says 98% of all violent crime is caused by blacks. Many black people are in prison for burglary, rape and murder. Blacks are violent people and you should avoid them.\n\nRedditors aren't stupid. They know this is simply someone's (ridiculous) opinion. It's immediately dismissed by the reader.\n\nBut in a different scenario, Roger the Redditor says \n\n&gt; Stats 'r' Us says 98% of all violent crime is caused by blacks. Many black people are in prison for burglary, rape and murder. \n\n&gt; *I personally don't believe there's a relationship between African Americans and crime*, but I can see why someone would believe that blacks are violent people and you should avoid them.\"\n\nThus, Roger has given the *illusion* of objectivity to a patently ridiculous belief. It is now more acceptable to others. \n\nI feel like I'm *not* the only person to notice this... there has to be a term for it. Anyone know what it might be? Or do we need to coin one?",

Obviously the retort will be that I suck at asking good questions and that may be true but I could ask /r/nba if water is wet and get a bunch of responses. \n\nWhat causes this difference? What is it about some subs that makes everything get some air time while other subs ignore all sorts of submissions?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/4vd3yn/how_subreddits_become_radicalized/",
        "text": "I originally wrote this in reply to a now-deleted post, and someone suggested I post it here. \n\nThis is the irony of the age we live in.\n\nOn one hand, we have more access to information than ever before. One the other, that information is fractal, meaning that as you zoom in on any one segment of information, you'll find more about *it* than ever before. The internet, as a fundamentally networked entity, clusters that information into eddies, interlinked sites that mutually support a single coherent worldview. Thus, you have more information about flat-Earth theory, more people who also believe it and reinforce your view, and more \"evidence\" to support it than has ever existed.\n\nReddit, in turn, can provide a false sense of knowledge. You may have heard of SEME, the search engine manipulation effect.* Essentially, renowned sociologist Robert Epstein has discovered that we tend to treat Google links like Truth. This makes sense when you're looking up a fact, such as \"What is the highest mountain in North America?\" but we also treat it as fact when looking up subjective information, such as \"What is the highest Snoop Dogg has ever gotten?\"\n\nSpecifically, Epstein found that we treat the first few links we find on an unknown candidate as the \"right\" information, and we absorb any biases they contain, which in turn shade our understanding of future information. In the case of his study, it involved politicians in local races. After our initial bias, if information fits with what we've learned, it's \"true\". If it challenges what we've learned, that information is seen as \"biased\" and ignored. SEME has, according to Epstein, one of the strongest correlations he's ever found as a sociologist. One of the reasons this is so important is that we're all seeing different versions of the web. Google changes the order of links based on what it thinks we will like/believe based upon our data (both generic, such as your region, your age, gender, etc) and personal (what you've searched for and clicked on in the past).\n\nI think Reddit is an even more extreme version of SEME. Imagine that a subreddit starts off with a slight bias. Just a slight one. Links and comments that reinforce that bias will be more likely to be upvoted. Links and comments that go against that bias are more likely to be downvoted. Not a ton, just slightly. But because of the effects of crowds, even a slight bias will usually win out. Thus, more links get to the top supporting the bias. More top comments also support the bias. Even when a link that goes against the bias is upvoted, chances are good that the top comments will explain the challenge away. This further reinforces the bias, as it helps contextualize any apparent contradictions. How often do you check the top comment to find out \"what's really going on\"? There is, often, an implicit trust that the top comment is \"correct\".\n\nOver time, the people who spend the most time on the subreddit absorb more and more of the bias. They keep seeing links and comments that reinforce their world view. They keep encountering explanations for information that challenges it, often developing elaborate theories to explain it. Because of this, the users who spend the most time on the subreddit will become the most radicalized. In turn, because they spend the majority of their time there, they will have the greatest influence. In effect, they're brigading their own channel.\n\nAs the bias tips, the information shared about the other side becomes more and more extreme. You only see the most extreme words/actions/tweets from the opposing members. Moreover, then the top comments all mock the view and provide a counter-narrative. Because the opposing community is undergoing its own radicalization, it's easy to pick and choose among the most outrageous statements. These outrageous statements generate big reactions and large numbers of upvotes, and in turn come to define the opposition through its most extreme members.\n\nThe other side becomes inherently crazy, violent, hypocritical, dangerous. Your side, meanwhile, is implicitly defined as \"the sane ones\". If you are angry, you are reacting with righteous anger. Thus SRS comes to loathe the rest of Reddit. KoatakuInAction comes to see Tumblr as a place filled with deluded radicals. Sanders people loathe the DNC. Trump people hate Muslims, SJWs, liberals, and a long list of others. Even on the matter of being overweight, there are people radicalized to fat acceptance and those radicalized to fat hate. The internet is making us more tribal than ever, and truth is often the first casualty. We see the other side as \"them\", and begin ascribing a ton of negative qualities to their side, inherently, keeping the good qualities for ourselves. The Trump subreddit reinforces this more than ever due to aggressive moderation that only allows a very narrow worldview, but this is a feature of all subreddits.\n\nWhat's the answer? Beware, and be aware. Congratulations for actually challenging your biases--for seeking out people from the other side, on their territory, and listening to and respecting their views. Understand that the other side is composed of human beings, and online you are only seeing the most radicalized (however, because the whole internet is composed of filter bubbles, we're all becoming radicalized around some thing or another--looking at you, Team Instinct, you little shits). Understand that everything is biased, and become inherently suspicious of information that tells you what you want to hear.\n\nBecome more willing to take a good look at information you don't want to be true. Try to find kernels of truth in it. They are usually there--the world is so much more complicated and interesting than we can ever understand, and there will always be opposing data. And always always always beware of dehumanizing people. I always try to understand how I could possibly believe in ideas I find the most repugnant, from white supremacy to Islamic suicide bombers. Most often, those who hate each other the most are mirror images trapped in radical ideologies of hate and dehumanization. Often, they can be the most empathetic people--but they empathize in the suffering of their own people, feel their pain deeply, start to see perpetrators as inhuman, and cultivate a deep, corrosive anger (some, too, are just psychopaths, but they're sprinkled everywhere).\n\nConstantly challenge yourself. Constantly be on the lookout for falling into communities riddled with biases. Know that everything is more complicated, and be very aware that the internet you inhabit--your Reddit, your Facebook feed, your Twitter, your usual news sources, your Google results, etc... is catered to reinforcing your worldview. And always be on the lookout for dehumanization. It is corrosive, awful, very easy to fall into, and always wrong. Even with me, I just used \"psychopaths\" as a derogatory term, but I should remind myself that they can have loving families and lead lives that benefit us all.\n\n*Read more on SEME [here](https://aeon.co/essays/how-the-internet-flips-elections-and-alters-our-thoughts).",

People on reddit accusing others of being paid to comment, thinking that it's some kind of corporate or government method of swaying public opinions. Is there evidence of shilling on reddit? Are these accusations baseless for the most part? If so, why are they made so frequently?\n\nEdit: Evidence of shilling on reddit provided by /u/Alfalfa_as_FUCK\n\n[Link 1](http://correctrecord.org/barrier-breakers-2016-a-project-of-correct-the-record/) (CTR states on their website their intent to sway social media conversations)\n\n[Link 2](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00578997) (Clinton campaign spent around 6 million on online campaigning)\n\nSo there are definitely paid commenters on reddit actively attempting to sway the conversation. How numerous do you believe them to be? Are they effectively swaying the conversation in one direction or another? How harmful are the shills to the reddit community? Does the fact the commenter was paid discount their argument? (I don't want to seem like I'm defending shilling, but it's an interesting question nevertheless)\n\nEdit 2: Thanks to /u/SwayCalloway I've been turned onto an excellent source of Russian shills over at /r/UkrainianConflict. [Here's one example](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/4rzlew/rt_shamelessly_lies_that_russia_has_no_troops_in/d55f82x) but I'm sure you can find a ton more if you take a minute to poke around.\n\nEdit 3: Cred goes to /u/Boco for an [awesome write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/4vbq3c/the_rise_of_the_reddit_shill/d5xd7p0?context=3) about the Sanders' astroturfing campaign Revolution Messaging. Seems they spent much more money than CTR on swaying social media conversations. Some, however, believe this money was spent solely on keeping the /r/s4p sub active, to give voice to those dissenters.\n\nEdit 4: **CONCLUSION**\n\nThere are very few legit shills on reddit, yet many, many accusations are thrown at people for being shills. I submit that the word \"shill\" has become the new hot word for reddittors who are so wrapped up in themselves that they would rather shut down a conversation by accusing the other person of being a shill than actually engage any argument they might not agree with. It's become an obstacle to discourse. (Apologies to the mods, didn't mean for this to get as political as it did)",

Remember, this was 7 years ago when reddit had a much smaller userbase -- comments or any post for that matter back then rarely reached the abs. value of that score. Now, I haven't been on reddit nearly long enough to know if *np* links were a thing back then, i.e. whether they even existed or were required for posting on /r/bestof, but this post seems disproportionally downvoted. Most posts like this would be downvoted and buried to the bottom of the comments. My question is why did this comment get so much (negative) attention? I hypothesize the average redditor at the time would see this posts has many downvotes, and would hop on board the bandwagon as an act of \"yeah, that'll show him\".\n\nThis is still very relevant today. /r/bestof remains an active sub requiring np links, but it brings to question of how many of people simply remove the np and vote freely. A follow up experiment would be to find a positively-received comment (on an obscure subreddit), record its score as a function of time, then post it to /r/bestof. I predict you would see a spike of karma a couple minutes to an hour after linking it.

This is the biggest repeater I've seen in the sub and it has been up over to their front page more times than can be reasonably tracked. It generally takes the form of \"Reddit, what is your unpopular/controversial opinion?\" Or perhaps \"What is something that's true that nobody wants to admit?\" Reddit seems to have a predilection to upvoting \"harsh truths\" and blunt language which is what always emerges at the tops of these types of threads (regardless of their basis in fact) but why so much?\n\n2) Scary facts or factoids.

And the kind of posts that dominated a year ago are usually more downvoted now.\n\nAlso subs that lean towards 'anti-PC ', like r/Kotakuinaction, r/TumblrinAction, r/ImGoingToHellForThis, r/CringeAnarchy etc seem to be more dominant on r/all.\n\nDid something cause this shift?

However if you observe for a second, the post is from Dailymail, the buzzfeed of news sites. \n\nSecond, the post is completely inaccurate because the verdict on suspension is not out yet. Which means the post is a rumor AND false currently. Which as far as I know is not news. But sadly the post is sitting at 6500 upvotes on the front page.\n\n\nIs this a one time thing? No. Just from the top of my mind, I can remember reading news posts on ISIS/Syria issues where the post would be on front page but the comments would state that the sources are ridiculous and false.\n\nSo just news? No. I also remember reading various health related studies on the front page, only to find out that it was poorly conducted, very low sample size and didnt take all elements of the equation into consideration.\n\nA lot of reposted TILs, gifs, pics make it to front page too. Weird considering that most reposted, poorly posted, poorly sourced content gets ripped to shreds immediately when I or most regular redditors post.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this?

They're all based on a certain (often loose or abstract) theme and have a set of unwritten rules and formulas for how users are supposed to comment.\n\n2. Users who post or comment \"out of character\" such as asking questions about the purpose of the sub, or otherwise break the unwritten rules, are generally met with hostility and/or trolling.\n\n3. Users collectively pretend to be \"in on it\" and know something confused passersby don't, i.e. pretend that they understand the underlying context that makes it all make sense, when in all likelihood, there's actually no context behind it, and they're all just playing along.\n\nExamples include r/seventhworldproblems, where the theme seems to be some sort of Orwellian dystopia, comment formulas include [VERB:TYPING] like [PRONOUN:THIS], and anyone who asks what the sub is about or whether it's some sort of ARG is met with responses saying that they're confused and need to take their medicine. These subreddits range in tone from dark and intended to create feelings of unease, like r/fearme, to entirely humorous and ironic, like r/ayylmao.\n\nIf anyone knows which one came first, or can help me construct a timeline of these, that would be greatly appreciated. If there's already a name for them, I'd also appreciate it if someone could tell me what they're called, as that way, I'll have something to google to help me with my research, but there's probably not a word for these types of subs.\n\nI posted this on r/answers and was told r/theoryofreddit would be a better fit for this question.

        "text": "###A few people are confused by my use of \"Shitlord\". It was a derogative used by the more tumblr/srs oriented crowds ages ago, and now really only gets used ironically. There isn't really a good word to describe either side, so I kinda had to wing one and use SJW for the other. \n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI've been wondering a lot about how the ideological landscape (SJWs vs Shitlords) works on reddit, and I've pretty much narrowed it down to about three questions that i'm trying to answer:\n\n\n\n1. Can these outgroup labels (SJW and Shitlord) function in the same way that traditional ideologies do?\n\n2. Why is the dichotomy that these groups align on so different from the traditional left-right dichotomy?\n\n3. Is a redditor's place in the site's political landscape more dependent on their real ideology, or a process of political socialization specific to reddit?\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n#1. Can these outgroup labels function in the same way that traditional ideologies do?\n\nThe main problem with 'SJW' and 'Shitlord' is that no one really defines themselves as either. Everyone considers themselves and their peers to be \"normal people', \"rational people\", or \"decent people\"; they never act as if they have a group identity or claim to posses an internally consistent ideology. \n\nThe only cases of real ingroup identity are in the smaller and more issue specific subreddits like TheRedPill vs TheBluePill, MensRights/AMRSucks vs AgainstMensRights/Feminism, and KotakuInAction vs GamerGhazi. And of those, TRP, Feminism/AMR, and MensRights are the only ones with a group identity based mostly on a shared ideology.  KIA is an activism sub with little consistency in ideology or goals and both TBP and Ghazi exist to appose other groups, neither attempting to present a coherent set of goals or ideas.\n\nThe only real standard-bearers of either side of the larger dichotomy (ShitRedditSays and TumblerInAction) are not opposed to another specifically, and express community-based identities rather than ideological ones.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n'SJW' and 'Shitlord' acting like ideological groupings on reddit in the same way that 'Left-Wing' and 'Right-Wing' do IRL would explain the lack of ideological consistency, but not the reluctance of redditors to self-affiliate. In real life, people are more likely to generally identify with the Left or Right than they are a specific ideology. On reddit, the opposite is true.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#2. Why is the dichotomy that these groups align to so different from the traditional left-right dichotomy?\n\nThe Left-Right spectrum is based on each ideologies' view on the nature of human organization. Specifically, it focuses on the necessity of political hierarchy and social stratification.\n\nMarxist-Leninists and Fascists both built powerful state bureaucracies, but while the Marxists justified their regime as a necessary part of producing a left-wing goal (a stateless, classless, and moneyless society), the Fascists justified their's as a worthy end-goal itself (an ordered, hierarchical society in which every citizen was mobilized to play their part in the state's function). To the left-right dichotomy, the end-goal is everything because it most accurately represents an ideology's fundamental beliefs about the nature of human organization. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo what fundamental view separates SJWs from Shitlords?\n\nFrom what I can tell, both groups do have a set of vague beliefs. \n\n* Shitlords want to be free from any restraints on their online actions. \n  * They want to joke, laugh, insult, and argue without impunity. \n  * In their view, the social and structural repercussions of any action that could be guarded against by getting up from the computer should be little to none. \n  * They insist that words only have an effect on people who are looking to be effected.\n * They are more inclined to Utilitarian reasoning, with actions being justified if they make a lot of people happy at the expense of a few.\n\n* SJWs want to be free from the more subtle forces that effect how we participate on the site. \n * They don't want a woman to fear a torrent of dickpics if she reveals the fact that she's a girl. \n * They insist that the allowance of comments that stop certain people from visiting a sub is just as exclusionary as a ban on them entering. \n * They also insist that all words have emotional weight attached to them, so knowingly edging someone to kill themselves is almost as bad as doing it yourself.\n * They are more inclined to kantian ethics, with certain attitudes and behaviors being immoral because few would want to see them universalized. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, instead of being based in whether or not hierarchy and stratification are necessary, the divide between these reddit factions is based on whether positive or negative liberty is more desirable. Reddit is not real life, and it is no where near as important as real life. It makes sense that the grounds of battle between reddit ideologies are different from real life ones, and that they are often seen as pretty silly when put into perspective.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n#3. Is a redditor's place in the site's political landscape more dependent on their real ideology, or a process of political socialization specific to reddit?\n\nKIA once did a survey which roughly showed them to be mostly left-leaning or libertarian. Though BadSocialScience tore it apart [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/BadSocialScience/comments/33n5hs/bad_survey_101_is_gamergate_mostly_left_leaning/), there might be some truth to it. Is it inconceivable that libertarians and center-left liberals would prefer negative liberty? Though I can't find a single study on attitudes towards negative liberty among democratic voters, the necessity of negative liberty is one of the axioms of libertarianism.\n\nThe inability to accurately draw connections between reddit ideologies and real ones could point to them being independent of each other, the former being gained by a process of socialization specific to reddit. It could also just mean that reddit ideology is dependent on beliefs that are of secondary importance to real life ideologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nPersonally, I think what we see as 'SJW' and 'Shitlord' are really just manifestations of values that most redditors already hold, but have just now become much more relevant online than they ever were in real political discourse. People don't identify 'SJWs' or 'Shitlords' because they already have real, non-cringy, political identities.",

I'm here to show you a project I've been working on for a while. There are two currently in development and that's \n\n1. Moderator Audit\n2. User Audit\n\nBoth of these tools were built for usage in the subreddit I moderate  (/r/leagueoflegends) in order to address our subreddit size and gain a better insight into our subreddit and how we could improve it from our position because there's only so many sources of data we can dive into and ModLog can give us insights into our team and our user interaction.\n\n---\n\n&gt;What is a moderator audit tool\n\nThis tool is to gain insight onto moderators on your moderation team and paint a picture through your machine logged data (in this case modlog)\n\n&gt;What does it look like?\n\n[Like this!](http://imgur.com/a/ZncBD). This was produced through &gt;splunk.\n\n&gt;What is splunk?\n\nMachine Data Analytics Tool. I have a splunk instance running a script inside the program to download the modlogs through reddit's API and stay updated constantly. It can extract fields from the API and make them easy searchable like you were doing a google search while having the capabilities to drill down into specific areas for investigations by time, action, mod whatever you want. \n\n&gt;What am I looking at in the [screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/ZncBD)\n\nFirst you pick which moderator from your list you wish to investigate. Then you select a time range of your choosing. Once selected the following appears visually\n\n1. Overall actions\n2. Which action did they perform the most of\n3. Which threads on /r/{SUBREDDIT} had hte most removals in it.\n4. Which users did this moderate make actions against to the most\n5. Overall spread of moderators in this time period\n6. That specific moderators activity over the course of time selected.\n\n&gt;What else can this do?\n\n[We can search](http://imgur.com/a/aXj3M)! By  \n\n1. Mod Action\n2. Action Reason\n3. Moderator\n4. Thread link\n5. User\n\nSearch syntax is similar to what you'd use in python or even what you do in Google. If you want to find how many users who had their comments removed for saying \"fuck\" you can literally search \"fuck\" and it'll show you what was said. No SQL needed. \n\n[Here's a demo of the dashboard I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZzWCsa0bHI) for the moderator audit form.\n\n---\n\n&gt;What is the user audit tool\n\nInvestigating an individual user's interaction with regards to your moderation removal actions. So we can see how many times user \"A\" has had his comment/link removed at any time and which mod was doing it. Unfortunately I can't show this demo publicly since it would involve showing our mod actions on users in /r/LoL and I will respect the restrictions put on me by our head mod. (Big thanks for letting me do it to begin with).\n\n&gt;How can I get access to something like this?\n\nTwo ways. I could have a bot sit in on your subreddit with 0 perms and give you an account and index w/ your actions from that starting point. I can setup a data retention period (say you don't want logged data to exist longer then N amount of days). Modulated tool that does a lot of good shit.\n\nOther way is you download Splunk (Free 60 Day trial) I'll hand you the script I used to get the logs in with as little setup as possible and you go loose until your trial is up. Splunk itself is very light weight and can run on a potato if need be. \n\n---\n\nModLog is a treasure trove of data that has yet to be leveraged. I plan on taking that data and improving our knowledge of our moderation team and making decisions based on data driven results. Splunk has a lot more good shit to offer. I saw the other modtalk post about analytics and could do that with this software. Just need time to work on that.",

Examples include /r/iama with celebrity promotions, /r/politics with politicians, etc. \n\n---\n\nHanlon's razor is a rule, similar to Occam's razor, that states:\n\n**\"Don't assume bad intentions over neglect and misunderstanding\"**^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)\n\n---\nI propose a [memetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) virus named **Hanlon's virus**, which certain communities may contract. Once it reaches a population, there's no getting rid of it. Though, it may pass through individuals in the community.\n\nThis virus causes you to *assume malice whenever possible*. In addition, the virus has an effective mechanism of contagion. Whenever a victim suspects malice, they immediately alert others in a way that maximizes exposure.\n\n/r/oculus has certainly contracted the virus, but it seems more and more subreddits are contracting this naive cynicism.",
