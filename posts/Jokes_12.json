Some say he was just in a desperate situation, some say these cows had been abused and that he was rescuing them, some say he was just a greedy old farmer.\n\nHe attempted this great bovine burglary by stealing a train one night that ran on a line that went past both farms to load up the cows. The cows he tried to steal were all the shortest cows of the herd, and people use this fact to try to prove their point.\n\n “Oh those were probably the ones most mistreated”, \n\n“ah, see those cows are lowest to the ground, they’ll eat the grass more efficiently, growing faster than all the others!”, \n\n“No no, they’ll be low enough to the floor of the train carriage, any passers by wouldn’t be able to see them through the window!”\n\nUnfortunately, no one will ever know for sure, as on the way back, cows in tow, he crashed the train and sadly passed away later that night. Thankfully the cows survived and were returned home. Once more, questions arose as to how this happened. Was it a problem with the train itself? Could it have been his own incompetence? We’ll never know.\n\nAnd so, this farmer became a local legend. A hero brought down by a faulty train to some, a villain taken out by his own hubris to others.\n\nNo one ever figured out if he did have good low-cow motives.",
