I am sure I can eat all of this and it's all pretty shelf stable. \n\nI plan to cover the rest of nutritional needs with store-brand multivitamins and bread and occasional meat from the farmer's market which is doodoo cheap and probably a ridiculous amount of overnight oats - I think this covers fiber and protein and most of it should be pretty quick eats. What do you think? I am pretty new to budgeting. This month has been a financial disaster lol \n\nAssuming this wasn't all from gift cards - is this a decent cost? Compared to the grocery store near me it is probably $30-$50 cheaper but it's hard to say with sales and coupons and in general not sure if it is that frugal. \n\nMight lose out on variety but it must be better than the $6-$10 I am spending on food daily.",

I also help make sure he completes Eagle Project by 3/31. I also let my teaching credential expire, which would require tests and money.\n\nI looked into subdividing my land, but it would require permits, a new plat/survey, and installing a culvert. My land is also awkwardly shaped. \n\nI want to retrain as a home inspector but don't even have cash for that $1300. \n\nSadly, I did declare bankruptcy last month, but we are still struggling. I have covid, too, so that puts getting another job on hold.\n\nI pawned some jewelry and had a paid off older car that needs a new transmission.  \n\nMy mom always said hindsight is better than foresight. I need to forgive myself for my mistakes.\nI also truly believe that I am my best asset, and I want to turn this around. \n\nMy biggest expenses are auto payment at $600/mo and my insurance coverages - health, auto, life, and property. I have never struggled like this. I had to make a hard decision not to buy all my meds for $17 for covid. Or skip teladoc appt for $10. \n\nLastly, we are frugal and cook from scratch alot. Pack lunches. I am considering food banks. I pay $175 for internet, but we have limited options because we are very rural.\n\nAny constructive advice would be very helpful.",

Plus anyone who has eczema/family with eczema knows how expensive creams/lotions get. While at the Dollar Tree last week, my wife noticed a tube of Thera Plus Eczema Cream (it’s in a blue box). It got good reviews and other 3rd party websites were trying to sell it for 3x-4x the price, so we gave it a shot. \n\nWe were shocked how well it cleared up his flare ups on his face just overnight!

After seeing natural disasters like the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, it made us realize how ill prepared we are and it seemed like a good idea to be ready in case of any emergencies.\n\nI tried looking for a complete kit, but they all seem to be pretty expensive for what they offer. So that made me wonder if there was a way to make my own kit and getting more for my money even if it requires a bit more effort on my part. I don't necessarily mind the cost of the kit, as it seems like a relatively small price to pay for a bit of peace of mind in an emergency. But I would like to maximize my dollar as that's why I love being frugal. \n\nWhat items should I buy and where can I get the most value for these items? In case it helps, this kit would be mainly for first aid around the house, for the occasional camping trip, and in case there is an earthquake since that is the biggest natural disaster risk in my area. \n\nSorry if this has been asked before, but Reddit's search function is so bad.

I get that they might be some slightly better quality but this is 2-3x price increase for the same amount of beef. \n\nAside from buying a whole cow (don’t have enough room for that) what is the best way to get this quality and quantity of meat for a similar price to costco? \n\nThank you!",

I live in New England. I'm tempted to not renew, although I worry about potential loss. I've done some research, almost 90% of the most common claims are the result of wind/hail, water/freezing, and fire/lightning (cooking causes 50% of home fires). I have a metal roof, I installed PEX plumbing, and I have smoke detectors that will notify me via the web, and fire extinguishers. For grease fires, I have pan covers that fit every pan I use. I also have a homestead which protects my home up to $500,000.\n\nAm I crazy to not renew? How many of you are homeowners without insurance?",

I had a friend which was also frugal and pushed expiration dates to the limit at the same time as setting their fridge at 46 degrees farehnheit / 8 celsius and he payed for that with his life due to extreme food poisoning. Guys being frugal is one thing but putting your life in danger is another. Here is the deal, to prevent anyone else from the harm and pain I have been through recently please for the love of god follow the suggestions below for you and your family.\n\nThe ideal **refrigeration** temperature for balance between electricity and food waste savings is 3 degrees celsius/37 fahrenheit. For those looking for maximum frugality you can only go up to 4 degrees celsius/39 farehnheit, everything above is unsafe dont do it!\n\n**For freezers** just make sure you are at 0 farehnheit/ -18 degrees celsius and you are safe.\n\nThe above data is validated by multiple fridge manufacturers (such as LG, Samsung, Whirlpool), field experts which I have contacted personally, the EU consumer regulations on food safety and the FDA with data as of 2023.",

I applied to jobs from 1700 miles away stating I was already moving (even though I wouldn’t have if I hadn’t gotten the job) ended up getting scouted for multiple jobs and offered 9 before moving. I accepted the easiest transition with the most relevant perks (they offered free food, a car, help with apartment hunting… fun fact GM positions will often come with similar perks because the need is so high) I also got a 2x yearly pay raise. Taking me from $20k to $48k.\n\nMoving is terrifying but if getting the job would make you change your circumstances you don’t lose anything by applying. \n\nFlash forward that location closed and I hated management so I transitioned into an entry level auditing position. Lower pay but EXCELLENT PERKS. I can’t even.\n\nThat was great. Until inflation. Now I just picked up a food gig on the side. Applied to all the close ones to me, got a few, and chose the best. Because min wage in my area is so high I’m making $22 on average an hour after tips doing fast casual pizza I literally just stand there and get free food and money basically. \n\nHighly recommend.",
