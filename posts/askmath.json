I have a few issues I am having with them, I will list them out separately. \n\nFirst problem:\n\n\"Solve Sin^8(x) by using power reducing formulas to rewrite the expression in terms of a first power of the cosines of multiple angles\".\n\nSo, my first thought would be, \"I have to get single to just the second power in order to use the formulas\" so I'm thinking I would raise (sin^2(x))^3 because 2^3 is 8? Everywhere online solving a similar power says I should be doing (sin^2(x))^4.  I'll be honest I don't have the best grasp of laws of powers and exponents. I also get extremely lost while trying to input the steps of the problems into the correct formulas and following every step. \n\nSecond problem:\n\nSo let's say I have to plug in (8sin^2(2x)) to the sun double angle formula (2sin(x)cos(x)), that would end up being (16sin(2x)cos(2x)) correct? I'm confused when I plug some of these into their formulas with coefficients or when the x part has a coefficient attached as well. \n\nThird problem:\n\nSame kind of situation as 2, but with power reducing formula where the angle has a coefficient. So like (8sin^2(2x) so with plugging into power reduction formula (1\/2(1-cos(2x)) would that end up being (1\/2(8-8cos(4x) or would the proper way to think about it be 8(1\/2(1-cos(4x))? \n\n\nThese two formulas are really killing me. Product to sum, sum to product, sum and difference, all relatively straight forward to understand, but the half angle, power reduction, and double angle formulas are really confusing me. \n\nI have not posted her prior so I do hope im not breaking any rules, I really appreciate any help.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678380788.0},{"title":"vector component and magnitude","author":"kingofbigmaths","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askmath\/comments\/11mtt1u\/vector_component_and_magnitude\/","text":"\ni am having some trouble understanding when to include the negative sign. suppose i have a vector V = 5i -2j. \n\nfrom my understanding -2j is the y component which is also a vector itself. the magnitude of this component is 2 since magnitude cannot be negative. what makes this component negative is the unit vector j which points in the negative direction indicated by the - symbol. \n\nto get the magntiude of vector V. it is the sqrt sum of all the component's magnitude- sqrt(5^2 + 2^2)\n\ni know it doesnt make a difference if i include the negative sign or not because its squared but is this the correct way? i see some people include negative signs in their componenta magnitude. please help me understand this logically.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678372610.0},{"title":"Is there a general symbolic formulas for the surface area of an ellipsoid?","author":"GoGraystripe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askmath\/comments\/11n2oaw\/is_there_a_general_symbolic_formulas_for_the\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678393401.0},{"title":"What is the name of the function?","author":"eternal-abyss-77","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askmath\/comments\/11mwkv2\/what_is_the_name_of_the_function\/","text":"What is the name of the function which maps each element in a given set A to every other element in set B except itself?\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nB = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nConsider mapping from A to B as pairs given in following list:\n\n>[          (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), \n\n> (2, 1),           (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), \n\n> (3, 1), (3, 2),           (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), \n\n> (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3),           (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), \n\n> (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4),           (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), \n\n> (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5),           (6, 7), (6, 8), \n\n> (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6),           (7, 8), \n\n> (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7),          ]\n\nUpdate:\n\n\nBy utilising u\/FormulaDriven comment,\nI asked ChatGPT the following:\n\n>f(A) = {(a,b) \u2208 A x A | a \u2260 b}\nSolve this.\n\n```The function f takes a set A and returns the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) such that a and b are both elements of A, but a is not equal to b.

I'm not trying to do any of that, I'm just trying to visualize an approximation in a way that I can get my head around, assuming we had a protractor and we are just trying for a scalable approximation.\n\nI think I found the possible answers to be 41 degrees and 49 degrees (and all rotations of a multiple of 90 degrees) for the following question which I came up with:\n\nConsider a 2x2 square, inscribed with a unit circle. Find the degree of rotation (relative to the 2x2 square) an inscribed square would need to have inorder for the inscribed square to have an approximately equal area compared to the circle (round to the nearest degree).\n\nYou can follow along my thought process on this picture: https:\/\/imageshack.com\/i\/podaPPAxj but I'll try to describe it all in text here.\n\nStarting with the image all the way to the left:\nI drew a 2x2 square, with a 1x1 square inscribed in it (aka, a square with 90 degrees rotation). Then I drew a circle inscribed in the 2x2 square. It is apparent that the circle is larger than the 1x1 square, but smaller than the 2x2 square. \n\nNext image to the right:\nIllustrating that if you cut a square diagonally, then construct a second square with a side equal to that diagonal, the area of the resulting square is two times that of the original square.  (Important for later on)\n\n\nNext image to the right:\nAny inscribed square will have an area somewhere between 1 and 4 (four at 0deg rotation, and one at 90deg rotation, cyclically). The inscribed square's corners will each touch one point on each side of the larger square. Those points of contact will move as we \"rotate\" the inscribed square, but they will all move together at an equal rate. Therefore, if one point of contact is at (x, 1) then the diagonal corner will be at (-x, -1).\n\nDistance formula:\nWe can find the length of the inscribed square's diagonal by using the distance formula and the points mentioned just above. The diagonal of the hypothetical \"rotated inscribed square\" would be sqrt[ (-x-x)^2 + (-1-1)^2 ], or sqrt[4x^2 + 4].\n\nArea of hypothetical \"rotated inscribed square\":\nIt should be 1\/2 of the squared diagonal, so it should be 2x^2 + 2. \n\n\nSetting area of the inscribed square to be equal to the inscribed circle:\n\nThe area of a unit circle is pi, so, 2x^2 +2 = 3.1415...\n\nDo the algebra: x= .75544...\n\nDo the trig: acos(.75544) = 40.93 degrees\n\nRound: 41 degrees\n\nConsider other answers: if 41 is an answer, 49 should be as well (90-41) and all 90 degree rotations of the two should be as well.\n\n\nSo, is this all correct?

The colors don't necessarily align perfectly with the preferences (for instance you might have 3 people who want blue hats but only 2 blue hats).\n\nYou assign hats randomly. The question is if you are allowed one swap, then how can you maximize the number of people who get their preferred color?\n\nA swap consists either a cycle (1->2->3->1) or a one-for-one swap (2 <-> 5) which could be considered a cycle of size 2. So you are allowed one exchange consisting of any number of cyclic exchanges.\n\nI suggested a formulation as an integer program. Optimizing that objective function would maximize the number of people with their preferred color.\n\nBut what's the best you can do in one exchange? That prompts my question. Does one exchange allow all permutations, i.e. can all permutations be represented as combinations of cyclic permutations? If not, how can you characterize the permutations which are legal under the hat-swap rules? How can you characterize and search the space of reachable configurations given a starting configuration of hats?\n\nI think this is probably Group Theory but that's not an available flair.\n\nEdit: Got the result I was looking for. \"All permutations have a disjoint cycle decomposition.\" That's sufficient to be able to accomplish the permutation in a single swap under the swapping rules.\n\nNow I'd just like to know why that's true.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678290484.0},{"title":"What's the functional equation of the red graph?","author":"LaserLars3000","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/gl8ksj79wcma1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678193960.0},{"title":"Would Keplars Ratios between nested Platonic Solids remain as you nested the higher dimensional Platonic polytopes?","author":"Complete-Ad5058","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/a9zcmqqn6hma1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678245886.0},{"title":"Field theory question","author":"impact_dev","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askmath\/comments\/11lvdsf\/field_theory_question\/","text":"Does someone know what the question is meant:\n\nWe know that any field has at least two elements.

Simply have each player matched against the person before and after them in the list, plus an exception match between the first and last players in the list. \n\nHowever we have not tried anything for `n>2` so let's try that now\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n`k=3, n=3`\n\nBy observation this is impossible. Players cannot be matched against themselves and each player has only 2 possible opponents so they can't be in 3 unique matches.\n\n**Example 5:**\n\n`k=4, n=3`\n\nSolution:\n\n* A vs B\n* B vs C\n* C vs D\n* D vs A\n* A vs C\n* B vs D\n\nWe essentially took our general solution for `any k, n=2` and built onto it at the end. All the criteria are met and at this point our findings seem to hint that `k > n` must be true for a solution to exist. \n\n**Example 6:** \n\n`k=5, n=3`\n\nAttempt 1:\n\n* A vs B\n* B vs C\n* C vs D\n* D vs E\n* E vs A\n* A vs C\n* B vs D\n* E vs ?\n\nWe tried to extend our solution from example 5 to account for one more player but failed. E has no valid third match with this approach.\n\nIn fact I'm not sure there even is a solution for `k=5, n=3`. I've tried several other attempts by hand and can't fit the fifth player in and meet all the criteria. Assuming I'm not just missing an obvious solution, this means that not all k and n have solutions (excluding obvious base cases like k = 0, k = 1, etc).\n\nIs this a solved problem anyone is aware of?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678220392.0},{"title":"invariant subspace","author":"Ervin231","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askmath\/comments\/11la1qt\/invariant_subspace\/","text":"&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zqr0dilbkdma1.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3dca62d4fbad48d55d3c8dcf3af11a1e13017fe1\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/irq9ullbkdma1.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c693fe96965b8279a816f3781c4321ea8c19af0\n\nHi everyone, so they proved that the sequence (\\[x\\_1+...x\\_n\\]\/n) converges to L in R, that is with respect to the |.| norm.

Apologies if this is outside the scope of the subreddit; it's a mathematical issue at the fundamental level, but perhaps a step too far removed from that...? Most of the context relates to this video:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iiGe2x8t6mA\n\nThe key takeaway is this: In a hyperspherical space, you essentially see objects at your antipode - OR should nothing be there, yourself - as though it were at d=0 IE right up in your face. In the case of seeing yourself, the image is inverted.\n\nMy concern, however, is that this doesn't strictly apply in a practical use case. For simplicity, consider an observer looking out from an illuminated, spherical earth that does not move in space or rotate, in an otherwise empty 3-sphere universe. Indeed, the observer should see the earth itself, the light having looped all the way around the universe and back again. However, the image you see is NOT your antipode('s antipode), rather it is the opposite side of the planet.\n\nMy assumption is that therefore the image would not appear to be at d=0 but rather more like d=earth's diameter, at least in the centre while the 'edge' of the image appears closer (d=earth radius?), thus overall appearing concave, and visible in the centre of the sky (and occupying most of it) from any point on the planet. You do see a concave effect in the video, and additionally I downloaded the program used and attempted to recreate the described conditions, but the positioning is not very precise and I can't vouch for the program's accuracy so I find myself uncertain of my conclusion. Can anyone more mathematically knowledgeable please verify my assumptions and\/or explain why I am wrong?\n\nAnd a follow-up, if you'll forgive me: Consider instead a *moving* planet (you know, like one that orbits a star). Given that the speed of light is not instantaneous, by the time it completes the universal lap the planet will be in a different position from the duplicate. My assumption here is that if the offset exceeds the earth's diameter the duplicate will appear 'normal' IE convex and not inverted, and only visible if you're looking in the right direction namely towards your original position. Is that correct? If so, what if the offset is *less* than the size of the planet such that it is overlapped with the position of the apparent duplicate? Normal at the extremities, but inverted and concave within the overlapping zone...?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678084034.0},{"title":"how can I solve this for pn","author":"PieceCapable6494","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/en9n1wtel4ma1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678093479.0},{"title":"Am I counting this correctly (basic combinatorics)?","author":"BlueHatScience","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askmath\/comments\/11jlebt\/am_i_counting_this_correctly_basic_combinatorics\/","text":"Say I want to do some basic debugging of some modular hardware. I have 19 devices which will be plugged into 36 power headers - which are in turn subdivided into three sections (A, B, C) of 12 headers.\n\nOnly which modules are assigned to which section matters, not the arrangement within sections (it's a power-draw issue [actually: current inrush], and we assume all components are working correctly individually).\n\nAlso, I have two adapters which I can optionally use, which might alleviate the situation when plugged in between a device and a power-header. How many configurations are there?\n\nThis is how I am counting:\n\nFirst, I can use 0, 1 or 2 adapters on 19 devices - that's (19 choose 0) + (19 choose 1) + (19 choose 2) = 1 + 19 + 171 = 191 possibilities.\n\nThen, for each of these (multiplication), I need to choose how to distribute devices over sections. I pick out a section, say A and start counting possibilities:\n\nSection A might get the maximum number of devices - 12. Since arrangement within a section doesn't matter, I only count the possible selections of devices (19 choose 12). But for each of those choices, I have to choose how to distribute the remaining 7 modules over the remaining 2 sections, which is just a function from a set of 7 into a set of 2, so 2^7. Thus, when section A gets 12 modules, I add (19 choose 12) * 2^7 possible configurations.\n\nI iterate over the number of possible devices assigned to section A, adding ((19 choose 11) * 2^8), ... ,((19 choose 0) * 2^19).\n\nAs such, the explicit form for *k* devices distributed over 3 sections with *m* maximal capacity per section and *n* available adapters (with 3m >= k, 0 <= n <= k) would be:\n\n(\u2211_{0<=i<=n} (k choose i)) * (\u2211_{0<=j<=m}((k choose j) * (2^(k-j)))\n\n(Since the selection of devices for sections A and B uniquely determines which devices must go into the last section, the factor for the number of possible selections for the last section is always a multiplication by 1 which we drop.)\n\nWith k=19, m=12 and n=2 we get\n(\u2211_{0<=i<=2} (19 choose i)) * (\u2211_{0<=j<=12}((19 choose j) * (2^(19-j))) = 191 * 1.160.082.432 = 221.575.744.512 \u2248 221 * 10^9 possible configurations.\n\nIs this way of counting and resulting formula correct?\n\nAnd if we now said that arrangement within groups mattered, would I be correct in assuming that to account for this, we not only need to multiply each (k choose j) in the second summation with j!, but we also need to count the possible permutations (without repetition) for every distribution of the remaining devices over sections.\n\nThus, when section A gets 12 out of 19 devices in any of 12! arrangements, we need to multiply by the number of ways section B could get (7 choose x) modules for x between 0 and 7 and for each of those ways multiply by the number of ways the remaining 7-x modules are arranged in section C. So where we had ((19 choose 12) * (2^7)), we now have ((19 choose 12) * (\u2211_{0<=x<= 7}(7 choose x) * x! * (7-x)!)).\n\nHere, x! is for the number of arrangements of x out of 7 devices in section B and (7-x)! is for the number of arrangements of the remaining devices in section C.\n\nThe overall explicit formula then becomes \n\n(\u2211_{0<=i<=n} (k choose i)) * (\u2211_{0<=j<=m}((k choose j) * (\u2211_{0<=x<= k-j}((k-j) choose x) * x! * ((k-j)-x)!))).\n\nConcretely in our case\n\n(\u2211_{0<=i<=2} (19 choose i)) * (\u2211_{0<=j<=12}((19 choose j) * (\u2211_{0<=x<= 19-j}((19-j) choose x) * x! * ((19-j)-x)!))) = 191 * 6.282.647.653.140.069.120 = 1.199.985.701.749.753.201.920 \u22481,20 * 10^21 possible configurations.\n\nAgain - is the counting-process for this modification (and the resulting formula) correct?\n\nNo need to check the actual numbers - I'm far more interested in whether I'm counting this correctly.\n\n**EDIT:** I think I already see one possible error: When section A gets less than 7 modules, section B cannot get 0 since we have to distribute all 19. If A gets 6, B must get at least 1. In general, if A gets 7-p, B must get at least p modules. I am unsure of how to incorporate this into my formulae, though... \n\n**EDIT2:** Could it be that I just need to restrict the index-range of the third summation-term by shifting the inclusive lower bound of the index up by MIN(0, (k-m)-j)? The minimal no. of devices that need to go into section B (because C can only support up to m devices) when I chose 0 for section A is k-m. Every device I choose for section A will reduce this minimum no. of devices in B by one. When j is big enough that all remaining modules fit into section C, the minimum number in section B is zero. Thus I constrain the shift of the lower index bound to not become negative when j > (k-m).  So the formula would become\n\n(\u2211_{0<=i<=n} (k choose i)) * (\u2211_{0<=j<=m}((k choose j) * (\u2211_{MIN(0, (k-m)-j)<=x<= k-j}((k-j) choose x) * x! * ((k-j)-x)!))).\n\nIn the case when arrangement within sections doesn't matter, I think we just need to switch the 2^(k-j) term with \u2211_{MIN(0, (k-m)-j)<=x<= k-j}((k-j) choose x), getting\n\n(\u2211_{0<=i<=n} (k choose i)) * (\u2211_{0<=j<=m}((k choose j) * \u2211_{MIN(0, (k-m)-j)<=x<= k-j}((k-j) choose x)))\n\n**EDIT3:** I am confused about how I would generalize this to *l* sections (s.t. *l* * *m* >= k)... I would need a product over index range 1 to l-1 of the innermost summation, but the upper index bound on *that* summation would be k minus the total number of devices already chosen in previous sections - but I don't know how to express that, since inside of an iteration of the innermost summation, we have already summed over all possible number of devices to be assigned to each previous section, and cannot access the \"current\" number of devices in each previous section. As a programmer, I would implement that with something like map-reduce, but as a student of math, I am unsure how to express that.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678068875.0},{"title":"Can any one help me find the square footage of the this room.","author":"freedomfighterfpa","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/0makg6ipgyla1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1678037235.0},{"title":"Rearranging the equation of a circle","author":"Human-Detail-1512","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askmath\/comments\/11jk63n\/rearranging_the_equation_of_a_circle\/","text":"Why are we able to rearrange:\n\n(y-b)^2 + (x-a)^2 = r^2 \n\nInto\n\ny = sqrt(r^2 - (x-a)^2) + b\n\nI get it can be done by completing the square or using the quadratic formula, but I\u2019m not really understanding how (y-a)^2 just becomes y - b.\n\nCan this result also apply to any function or equation so if we had two variables in our equation for example E = kQq(x-y)^2 becomes E = kQqx - y?","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678065640.0},{"title":"How would I solve this Summation??

But from the theorem, the order must be the least common multiple of the two disjoint cycles, so wouldn't that just be (5)(1), which is still a 5-cycle? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all :)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678055803.0},{"title":"Is it Impossible to Select Two of Three Players with Coin Flips with Equal Probabilities?","author":"BrandonQuinnDixon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askmath\/comments\/11j6v7u\/is_it_impossible_to_select_two_of_three_players\/","text":"I was thinking about a problem which might naturally come up: if you have three players for a two player game, how can you use one or more coin flips to randomly determine which two players will play the game? You must use a method which requires every outcome to be equally likely.\n\nI thought of a few potential ways of doing this, but came to realize that there was always one possibility which was greater than or less than the others. I then thought about how I could map the possibility either via combinations or permutations to one or more coin flips, but I found that given a certain number of coin flips, there were either too many possibilities (i.e. 6 permutations when flipping twice) or not enough (i.e. 6 permutations when flipping thrice).\n\nI then thought, maybe I can use many flips to get each possibility twice or more to guarantee each outcome is equal in probability to the others. However, there is no power of 2 which is divisible by three, so this will not work either. I believe this fact is sufficient to prove that there actually is no way of solving this problem given the constraint that each outcome must be equally likely.\n\nEdit: there is one thing I've thought of: if we consider permutations, of which there are 6, and map it to three coin flips, except if we get tails twice in a row, start over. I haven't calculated the probabilities, but I want to discard this option anyway because it gives a possibility that the coin flipper would need to flip the coin over and over again before coming to a decision.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678041091.0},{"title":"Dice game","author":"Zuokcaj","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askmath\/comments\/11j6r8y\/dice_game\/","text":"I play a F2P game and I was having loads of fun doing missions until this one.\n\n\u201cHelp Yozo turn his luck around.
