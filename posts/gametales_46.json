Nice.\n\nAfter a day of searching we befriend a wizard. Much needed NPC for a Rogue, Ranger, and Fighter. He is kinda awesome, but we need to pay him to get stuff. He is human and wants us to help him reach the surface. Tightwad to the end.\n\nWe want some dark vision helmets to stop all the attacks that are attracted to the light. Go to local shop and sell a ton of stuff to get these helmets (plus no critical strikes). Finally get enough money and head back to him.\n\nDrop the cash and now we have to wait. We are outside and we hear a crash and explosions. Oh shit no. Fumblerooskie. Coming in he is impaled with a stalactite. Damn it, grab him and our gold and head to the streets. People have gathered from the explosions.\n\nWondering what to do, we see a priest in white robes. Saved. He comes over and says wizardboy is in bad shape and he needs donations to his god in order to heal. We think, we save the wizard he owes us big. Give priest all the gold.\n\nPriest needs room so we move the crowd away. Priest starts casting healing spells, verbal somatic materials are all done. Wait and wait and wait.\n\nPriest gets done, walks over to us. Says wizard boy is dead and he is sorry...shit...what do we do? White robed priest leaves, sad he couldn't help.\n\nHang around town. No darkvision, no gold, stuck in hookhorror underdark. We decide to leave town, too much attention. Walking out of town we notice a pile of white robes.\n\nShit. Don't trust a priest in white robes.",

        "text": "*Around the beginning of 2014 I moved into a house with three of my childhood friends. We all had a free Thursday night, and I've always wanted to DM a long running campaign so the four of us, and another friend who lived nearby, decided to jump in. I decided on the FATE system because I work with narrative &amp; characters much better than I work with stats. The setting is one of my own making, and one that I've grown very attached to. Set in the future, far away from Earth, the campaign takes place across three solar systems called* **Hyperion**, **Stone** and **Amaterasu**. *These systems are a space age re-imagining of Greek Mythology, Arthurian Legend and Eastern Folklore respectively. The Olympians are genetically enhanced leaders and Tartarus is a sun scorched prison planet. Excalibur is a notorious military space ship and the Round Table is the Arthurian navy's primary space station. Amaterasu... well we've not got there yet so I won't jump ahead.*\n\n*This setting is known as* **LORE**, *and it's where the story I want to share with you unfolds. If you guys would be interested in reading it I'd love to include you in the continuing twists and turns my players face. SO without further ado, the prelude...*\n\n**The Lore Archive**\n\n**Volume: 1**\n\n**Chapter: Prelude**\n\n*\"No stories truly begin. They are simply chapters of a larger volume.\" - Anonymous*\n\nThe prelude of this chapter concerns the irreparable compromise of the planet Earth in the latter half of the 24th Century.  After a prosperous industrial age corrupted the core of our planet, discoloured our skies and poisoned our oceans, humanity realised that we were living on a graveyard, destined to share its cold, quiet end.\n\nIt was at this moment that humankind resolved to flee our terminal home planet, and find a new residence in the deep expanse of space. A global alliance was formed. The long coveted ideal of world peace finally rose, not from love, but from desperation. Three interstellar arks were constructed, using the technological breakthroughs of mankind’s collective intelligence. Work continued tirelessly, with the final construction completed mere years before the planet would become entirely inhospitable to life. Mankind tentatively boarded their ships and fired themselves into the unknown. Entrusting the search for habitable planets to the ship’s computer systems, the last remnants of humanity placed themselves in cryogenic stasis, only to be awoken when a new home had been found.\n\nCenturies passed.\n\nAn alarm rang out across the halls of the three arks, the first sound heard by human ears in over half a millennium. We awoke and answered the machines’ summons. It quickly became apparent that they had completed their task, that they had found a system capable of supporting us. We lifted the shutters to look upon their discovery. What we observed was impossible, terrifying and astounding. What we observed, was Lore.\n\nA perfect white star shone through the quiet darkness. Its density was incredible. Its stability, flawless. Its satellites however were utterly inconceivable, for around this central star, three more suns revolved, in perfectly synchronous orbit. Three solar systems, each bearing a wealth of hospitable planets. Humanity had stumbled upon an unmatched cosmic anomaly, but, more importantly, they had found the perfect place to call home.\n\nThe arks separated, each terraforming and colonising a separate solar system in the orbit of the white sun. The people landed, then survived, then thrived and eventually built new spiraling civilizations in the firmament of the Lore system. Humanity swore to live together in a new age of peace, never again to fall back into the habits that ruined their long abandoned homeworld.\n\nIt’s been a long time since that promise was made. \n\nThe three systems are now great societies in their own right. The Yellow sun, **Hyperion**,  a lush utopia ruled over by the 12 Olympians, a collective of genetically engineered super beings, bred for leadership and ruling from the highest level of the largest city, Olympus. \n\nThe Red sun, **Amaterasu**, a sprawling technological superpower, where the line between the real and virtual grows ever fainter, connected by the vast computer system known as M, and protected by powerful artificial beings, the Computer Actuated Matrix Intelligences. \n\nThe Blue sun, **Stone**, a seemingly benevolent dictatorship ruled by the King Arthur and his unstoppable naval fleet that lies docked in the notorious space station, The Round Table.\n\nThe lessons of the past are slipping from memory. Though it is undoubtedly a time of great discovery and wonder, it is also a time of uneasy stalemates, dark motives and grand conspiracy. Humanity is at a crucial point, balancing on a knife edge between the values of our fresh start and the old habits we brought from our ruined earth. It is in this tumultuous time that our heroes find themselves. It is in this time, that a lone Minotaur makes his way to the Tower of Shallot.",

        "text": "Ever since I got my hands on the 5th edition starter box I have been awaiting my first chance to run it. That chance came along last night in the form of a one-off adventure; finally a chance to delve into the new system and see it in action.\n\n*The party followed the road south from Neverwinter, taking their wagon full of cargo to Phandalin. It was only a small group: Mikael Tarrin the Human Fighter, Danforth Ironfist the Dwarven Cleric, and Milo Greenbottle the Halfling Rogue.*\n\n*Coming across a pair of dead horses blocking the road the group were assaulted by goblins, springing out of the undergrowth. Danforth and Milo, busy checking out the dead horses, were caught by surprise, whereas Mikael with his bow already drawn was not.*\n\n*Battle commences, round one. The Goblins get their surprise round, but not before Mikael fires into the bushes at a Goblin, missing by a hair. Closing on Danforth and Milo, two of the goblins race in with their blades while the other two fired their shortbows. Hit, miss, miss, critical. The Dwarf fell on his face as one of the Goblins found their mark through his chain armour. Not the best start to the scenario, but recoverable.*\n\n*Round two. Able to act, Milo strikes his opponent leaving it bloodied. Danforth struggles to survive, critically failing his saving throw. Mikael takes another shot at the Goblins, but once again fires wide. Goblin’s turn to act. Hit, Milo falls. Hit, hit, Mikael takes two arrows and joins the rest of his party on the floor.*\n\nThis is bad. A TPK on round two of the very first encounter in the starter box, and they didn’t even get to take down a single Goblin. I hit most damage rolls at maximum, they barely had a chance to attack. Recoverable, as the scenario has an ‘out’ I can take.\n\n*Awakening in the forest, the night now descended, the party find themselves stripped of their cargo and their possessions. Deciding to press on into Phandalin rather than track the Goblins naked, they race to town without incident. Arriving, they wasted no time on rearming themselves through various favours and connections, all of which would have to be paid back later.*\n\n*Mikael retires promptly to his room. In typical Dwarven fashion, Danforth orders a cask of the finest Dwarven Ale to his room from the barmaid and also retires. Milo seduces the local weaver with expensive wine and polite conversation, before going back to her place.*\n\nSo much, so typical, I thought. I thought that the near TPK was to be the low part of the evening, but this is where it really started going wrong.\n\n*The cask arrives at Danforth’s room. Anticipating the barmaid, the Dwarf is instead greeted by the innkeeper’s son who carries the cask into the room. Danforth convinces the boy to take a sip, who near instantly passes out; poor boy didn’t have much of a constitution for Dwarven ale. Shrugging it off, Danforth proceeds to take the keg to his bed, drowns himself in it, and passes out.*\n\n*Morning arrives and Mikael heads down for breakfast, the scent of fresh bread and roasted meat filling the air. Walking past Danforth’s room he stops in his tracks, observes the passed out Dwarf and the innkeeper’s son through the still open door, and decides it is best not to get involved.*\n\n*Heading downstairs Mikael greets the worried innkeeper, who hasn’t seen his son that morning. Suggesting he might ask the Dwarf, who was the last person to see his son last night, Mikael agrees to watch the bar for a few minutes.*\n\n*Regaining consciousness, Danforth has but a moment to act. Deciding it best to stay put in bed, the innkeeper enters and observes the scene. Furious, the innkeeper wakes his son and sends him out to the stables to be dealt with later. Turning to the Dwarf, he commands him to leave the inn immediately.*\n\n*Danforth tries to argue. The innkeeper repeats his command, threatening the Dwarf with a stern beating if he didn’t leave. Danforth refuses to budge. His self-control failing, the innkeeper raged forward and welted the Dwarf with his belt, slapping harmlessly against his chainmail. Danforth touched the innkeeper and instantly killed him with Inflict Wounds.*\n\nHe had just murdered the innkeeper. This was unexpected. Naturally, I stripped him of his ‘good’ alignment on the spot. This was completely detrimental to the scenario, but it was still possible to recover. Or so I thought.\n\n*Fleeing the inn without saying a word to his companion, Danforth entered the nearby shrine and prayed to his deity. Taking notice of his evil action, he spoke with his deity, who commanded him to make reparations to the family. Danforth refused- no, worse, he back-chatted his deity. His argument lead to the deity responding ‘an eye for an eye, is that how you want it? Very well.’*\n\n*The party regrouped and started to head out of town on horseback. Once clear Mikael asked what had happened, and why he left so suddenly. Danforth confessed to the murder of the innkeeper. Milo was surprisingly calm, simply asking ‘did you hide the body?’ Mikael was outraged. Unable to continue, he struck the Dwarf unconscious and headed back to town.*\n\n*Once there he handed Danforth to the guards and told them all he knew. A trial was held, and based on the evidence available he was sentenced to death. A passing cleric, who had been vital in finding evidence to prove Danforth’s guilt, spoke only a few words: ‘An eye for an eye.’*\n\nAnd that ended that one-off session of the 5th edition starter box. I still have no hands on experience of how the system runs. Perhaps I’ll try again with a different group.\n\nTLDR: Dwarf murdered someone, provoked the wrath of his deity, got caught, got executed",

        "text": "**Street Level Shadowrun II: Crumbles hits the bricks Part 1**\n\nIn the last episode, we proceeded to mangle Food Fight and escape into the night - I truncated the thing, since we had a wee break, but this wasn't the only mission we ran that session. \n\nThe glue that holds a team together is what happens in the _downtime_.  Relationships between players aren't built in a firefight, once you've got to the point where you know the metagame well enough that when the chips fly you can just kick out the jams.\n\nAfter the enemy decker fled dribbling into the night, we tended to the last of our wound-licking and talked about the loot.  A couple of calls to various contacts, and we had...\n\nLess than a thousand nuyen in street value from the everything.  And almost a hundred thousand from the deck (As a side note, is this a little insane, or is it just me?)\n\nHotentote's contact offers us the best price, so he's off to the races to pick up his Scoot and drop off the loot.  I finish the breakfast cleanup and settle in to do armor maintenance.  Elliot is cradling the AK he looted from the store, looking a little shell shocked and peaky.  I try my best to give him a reassuring smile, and it actually works.\n\nTurns out the lad feels he was useless. I point out that he's responsible for completely shutting down the enemy decker, and that he wasn't responsible for getting his shit blown up.  It seems to work, and we spend the next few minutes chatting idly until the stench of unwashed Ork heralds the return of Hotentote and Zack. \n\n\"Here's your cut, big guy, and yours Elliot, and mine's already stashed, and here's a chunk of dosh for Crumbles.\" \n\nCrumbles.  Everyone stops and looks at Zack.  The poor bastard who was knocked out of the fight in almost the first turn, who shrugs and pockets the credstick.  \"Not my bad, man\"\n\nThere's no arguing with that, and we agree to meet the next day to see if we can't shake loose some work as a team.  Hotentote is hesitant to leave, and ends up borrowing my shower and bunging his clothes into the coin-op.  I look around.  Mama Warts doesn't offer much for amenities...   but lots of space.  Big, empty space since I left the Old Country.\n\nNot a lot of time later, I've got a roomate. \n\nThe rest of the team gets back at an appropriate hour and we bash about the place talking about what we're looking for and how we're gonna find it.  Out of character, we're debating how to spend the karma and cash from the first mission, which came to enough to do some little thing with.  I decide to burn a little on putting a couple points into my guns skill, and we roleplay that as spending some range time.  \n\nWe burn off some ammo and time, and loading back up to go back to my doss the GM asks us to roll perception checks... \n\nCrumbles blows it out of the water, and finds a concealed panel in the trunk of the Americar hides a troll-sized SMG and a couple of magazines...  turns out our stolen rustbucket has some history!\n\nCommlinks come out and calls are made, and Hotentote has a hit - one of his contacts needs some work done, and it's work he thinks we can do.\n\nAwesome.\n\nWe show up for the meet and get our instructions - a package is inbound, and the courier is penned up in a hardware store by a small street gang.  We're to provide a distraction.... \n\n**Part 2**\n\nI couldn't help my grin, out of character.  It was so bloody stereotypical, so _cute_.  We got off the ferry and were checking out the area, looking for the green and gold marks of our expected adversaries.  \n\nWhen a group of them strutted up to us.  Green and gold synthleather jackets, arrogant postures, sneers...  The leader, a slim human girl, stops in front of me.  I notice we're in matching \"flying V\" formations.  I'm at the head of ours, and she's at the head of hers.  She's talking.\n\n\"You boys must be new here, and kinda stupid if you think you're gonna pass through here without paying the toll....\"\n\nReally.\n\nWell...   no.\n\n\"Lady, you the dumb one here.  In this city, you pay the TROLL!\"\n\nAnd I bash her face in.  With my seven foot crowbar.  Tons of boxcars, and she's gone from zero to overflow blocks in one glorious swing.  Elliot racks his uzi, Crumbles pulls his AK from under his coat. Hotentote channels enough magic to flare some visible aura on his fists, and I just grin. \n\n\"I think you should leave now.\"  He says.\n\nAnd the most glorious sound comes over the teamspeak, as our GM rolls a stack of snakeyes and headdesks repeatedly.  The gang snatches up their fallen leader and scarpers, we escort the courier from the hardware store back to the ferry, and since there were no shots fired..  nobody's the wiser.\n\nWe made it on the return of the same ferry we took over.  Had the courier and the box in our contact's hands in less than ten minutes _realtime_.  Our GM was furious with me - I count this as a partial Henderson.  We got a 10% bonus for speedy delivery!\n\n",

        "text": "Care to hear my story of how I created my own Kingdom to conquer the nords?\n\nIt has been quite some time so if someone will correct the inaccuracies of my post i will edit it to be correct.\n\nThere was a time when King Ragnarr and I got along perfectly, even though I, a mercenary of swadia had met him on the field of battle. King Harlaus was a fair king by most accounts, but when I retook Praven in his name outnumbered 4-1 against King Ragnarr himself, he saw fit to make Praven the capital and his seat of power as it had been before, instead of awarding it to its savior.\n\nDuring the siege itself, one of the first people to strike at me upon the ladder was a man with fiery red hair, whom I bludgeoned with the pommel of my Bastard sword. The fight that ensued was the bloodiest siege I had ever won. And the unconscious fiery haired man revealed himself to be King Ragnar. Impressed with his courage to lead from the front, I opted to release him instead of await his bounty. He thanked me and told me I was too honorable for the company of Harlaus, and I should join him at his feast back in his capital.\n\nHe was right, evidently.\n\nAs I respected King Harlaus, I simply left his service upon hearing that I would not become lord of Praven.\n\nI informed my men that we were heading for (the capital of the nords, cant remember) to seek employment with King Ragnar.\n\nMy company was made of peasants who I had trained from the beginning, they were loyal to me, not any king. There were no whispers of treachery in my camp.\n\nWhen we arrived, there was a grand tournament being held. Fancying myself the best swordsman in the land, I immediately entered. Several of my close companions took the remaining slots, and we were assigned team colors for the first round.\n\nImagine my surprise when Ragnar himself was in the arena, and to fight by my side! This man truly did not shy away from combat.\n\nIm sure you know how tournaments go, but Ragnar and I stayed in the same team to the last round, where we fought one another.\n\nCompliments were showered at one another instead of the usual insults, besides him remarking on how glad he was that we were fighting with axes and not Bastard Swords.\n\nAdmittedly the fight took longer because I had grown so accustomed to the balanced Bastard sword I had used for so many battles. The top weighted axe was much harder to control and predict.\n\nEventually the axe found its mark, but not before I was hit as well.\n\nI must have hit harder, as King Ragnar yielded, and reminded me that he still had a feast to get to, and so did I.\n\nI stopped by the swordsister I had planted in the crowd to bet on me, collected the winnings, and briefly stopped by the smith on my way to the castle.\n\nThats where we met.\n\nThe love of my life. My eyes were drawn to her at the very moment I walked into the stall.\n\nA bastard sword masterfully forged and worthy of a lord. I asked him how much I needed to pay him to call her mine, and he muttered some ungodly number. He must have been surprised when I came back with the gold.\n\nI had to sell damn near everything, but this heavenly blade was mine.\n\nAdmittedly, I was rather late for the feast, but I had the sword. My own personal Excalibur.\n\nThe feast proceeded as usual, women swooned over my victory in the arena, men grumbled about how they would've beaten me. But then the king did something unexpected, and informed everyone that beyond being the champion of the arena, I was the reason this feast was happening, as I allowed Ragnar to return home from Praven safe and sound.\n\nHe then offered me the position of Martial if I swore fealty to him.\n\nThis was about as easy as becoming marshall got. I accepted. The existing martial was, displeased to say the least.\n\nTogether the Nords and I retook Praven, which was awarded to me, as it should have been. I captured Harlaus and ransomed him for a pretty penny, we took many castles, 2 of which were assigned to me, and then the King called a feast.\n\nI eagerly joined the tournament, and enjoyed the feast. We received word that one of my castles was under siege.\n\nI immediately left and summoned the lords to the castle as their marshall.\n\nOne lord showed up. He informed me he was there because he did not want to be around the king. With this man's help we repelled Harlaus again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nAnd then the lord informed me that his friend was having a feast at his castle and the king was decreed that all must attend. I attempted to defend my lands on my own, ignoring the gluttonous king, hoping he would someday rejoin the war.\n\nOne by one, I lost battles. I had to sacrifice men. Eventually my companions took their leave, disgusted at the sacrifices.\n\nWith no allies, I defended Praven.\n\nAfter three successful repels, I receive word from our king.\n\nHe is holding a feast in the capital.\n\nIt was hopeless. I surrendered to Harlaus. Locked in my own prison, I swore revenge on Ragnar the glutton.\n\nI had books smuggled in, I learned more about leadership, learned that Swadian Knights underwent the most effective training. I studied their training methods, and when I finally slipped away, began teaching them to my new soldiers.\n\nLuckily, my bastard sword was successfully hidden before I was taken prisoner. And I retrieved it and my armor before I left. My horse, Roach, was nowhere to be found.\n\nI returned to my King's grand capital, purchased a new horse, and stopped by the smith again.\n\nHe had a helmet that matched the hatred I felt in that prison. A bucket with two horns coming off of it and a red horsehair plume on either horn.\n\nLike the bastard sword, cost wasn't important.\n\nAfter getting a small nordic force to defend myself I rode back into swadia.\n\nAnd recruited.\n\nAnd recruited.\n\nAnd recruited.\n\nOnce I had about one hundred swadians we hunted raiders on the nord coast. This was their training. Group after group of raiders fell, I trained my men in technique, and soon we had a force of 70 or so Swadian Knights.\n\nI returned to Praven and crushed the resistance. I sent word to Ragnar that this was my land. I went and took several castles as well with the word to the king being the same.\n\nHe declined to give me Praven after careful consideration.\n\nAnd I declared myself the rightful king.\n\nKing Revan of the Old Kingdom! I marched on Harlaus first, as I needed swadians at my back to turn into knights. He fell quickly, and soon swadia was no more. Just the old Kingdom.\n\nAnd then I saw it. Ragnar had brought an 800 man army to bear against my swadian knights.\n\nI told my men it was time to prove that each of them was worth ten men.\n\nAt the end of the battle, I had 60 knights. And Ragnar had gotten away.\n\nI immediately thought that this cant be how this fight ends, and sent word to Praven to build the worlds most secure prison tower. And gave chase.\n\nMany cities fell as Ragnarr fled, but finally, I captured him. He told me he didnt understand. I told him I would make him understand.\n\nWe returned to Praven, my capital, and placed him in the newly constructed tower.\n\nAnd then I held a feast in full view of the tower.\n\nKing Ragnar the glutton remains in that tower. And will remain there until he dies. It was built to house him, and it does its job well.\n",

        "text": "This is going to require a little backstory, but I'll be as brief as possible. \n\nFifty years ago, the fascist, theocratic regime of the Church of St. Cuthbert established a penal colony/mining town as a prison for two thousand elven insurrectionists that had brought the city of Ironport to the brink of collapse. With the aid of the newly formed corporation of Steel Industries, and an army of warforged paladins known as the Iron Knights, the church solidified its hold on the territory with rapid expansion and colonization. Judgment Colony, the elven penal mine, stood to the present day as a symbol of the church's guiding policy of “No second chances.”\n\nIn the Jungles to the south, a band of adventurers from Ironport stumbled upon a conspiracy to free the elves after five decades of hard labor, and discovered evidence suggesting the church hierarchy to be infiltrated by worshipers of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They embarked on a journey across the dragon-infested jungle island to deliver a spell completion item to Jace Fairweather, a 95 year old civil engineer who had been the companion of those responsible for Judgment Colony's creation, who had vanished twenty years ago. He'd been hiding in the jungle, building a city and filling it with local near-feral halfling tribes, biding his time and waiting for a chance to blitz the penal colony.\n\nThese adventurers, Arthos the elf cleric, hist sister Elegia the ranger, Xavril the idealist half-elf arcanist, and Diowick the wasp-riding gnome cavalier, brought him what he needed. Opening a gate between the cities and giving his life in the casting, Jace brought thousands of halflings directly into the heart of the prison. The adventurers led the charge, using the halfling druids to send a herd of enraged triceratops in first, causing chaos and confusion among the unprepared troops. The primitive halflings followed like a swarm, exchanging javelin volleys for rifle shots as the church soldiers struggled and ultimately failed to form a firing line. \n\nMeanwhile, the adventures made a beeline for the warden's office, where they'd been informed they could deactivate the Wall of Force that kept the elves in the mine. On the way up to the office, they encountered several armed soldiers escorting a fresh prisoner, who had jumped clear of a charging triceratops. The arcanist created a pit under the soldiers, only to be telekinetically thrown over a building by an officer. The rest of the party caught up in time to dispatch the officer while Elegiea threw acid bombs into the pit before moving on to the warden. The prisoner, another half-elf named Arroden, joined them. \n\nReaching the office, using the cavalier's wasp mount as battering ram to take the locked door off its hinges, the party found Warden Aramos calling for reinforcements before summoning, to everyone's surprise, a pair of cacodaemons to aid him. As the fight progressed, they realized he was a cleric of the Horseman of Famine, disguised as a cleric of St. Cuthbert. His daemons grievously wounded the cavalier, but Arthos was at the top of his form, scoring several vital hits while Xavril and Arroden dismantled the Force Wall generator behind the warden's desk. The warden finally succumbed to his wounds, and outside the battle turned in the favor of the liberators as the elven prisoners swept in from behind and the two waves pincered the remaining riflemen cleanly. \n\nBeneath the warden's office they discovered an altar to Famine, to which a dozen elves had been chained and allowed to starve to death. The decision to burn the place to the ground was unanimous. Among the warden's personal effects they found a letter from a gravedigger they'd encountered weeks earlier in the jungle, now revealed to have been a servant of the Horseman of Pestilence. The cult, it seems, is everywhere. \n\nBut after fifty years of Tyranny, the first real blow to the church has been struck. An army of escaped elven prisoners and halfling savages is set loose upon the northern stretches of Cuthbert's Dominion, out for blood and ready to do whatever it takes to break the hold of the Horsemen's servants.

The Masamoto clan was a secretive society, but they were rumors of their involvement in legendary assassinations- thousands of ancient kings, shogun, and samurai have felt the bite of a Masamoto blade in their necks.\n\n Tokyo himself had mastered the Way of the Fist and Blade- a technique he had created himself, specifically to fight demons. His shogun demanded he keep his ability to himself- though his power could save thousands, it would reveal the existence of the Masamoto Clan.\n\n But Tokyo was not an evil man. And when he heard that a rural mountain town would be the epicenter of a demon invasion of Earth, he knew that he was their only chance.\n\n So he snuck out of the dojo in the middle of the night, and made his way to the village on horseback. Before he even dismounted, he could see the portal splitting the sky open. He unsheathed his sword and prepared himself for battle against hundreds of hellish foes.\n\n They say that the sound of teeth clashing against steel could be heard from the countryside. As the sun rose over the blood-stained huts, only one sound could be heard- Tokyo of Clan Masamoto cracking his neck.\n\n After the villagers excitedly spread the word about their mysterious savior, word of his exploits grew to a fervent pitch. When the shogun learned that Clan Masamoto was no longer a secret, he demanded the death of noble Tokyo.\n\n Though they tried poisoning him in his sleep, Tokyo was prepared for such an attack. He was forced to slaughter the men he once fought next to, the men he called friends. After seeing what he had been forced to do, Tokyo flew into a rage and severed the Shogun's leg.\n\n Now he wanders the Earth, longing for a way to redeem himself. Cleansing the world of other demons. He will walk the Earth until he dies. He is- Tokyo Masamoto\"\n\n Having finished his story, Tokyo slumped back in his chair, drifting into the level of unconsciousness that can only be achieved by an alcoholic 70-year-old man. Sager rolled his eyes and turned to the gorgeous brunette he'd been telling his story to.\n\n \"He tells the same story every time. In reality, he got really drunk on cheap sake one day, broke into a children's karate dojo, and stole a black belt. Then he accidentally hired me as a prostitute, and now we just roam around, kill shit, and loot everything\" \n\n Sager walked off to get another ale, and shortly afterwards Tokyo woke up with a start and glanced back at the girl. \"So, you wanna bang?\"\n\n She shrugs nonchalantly. \"Sure\"\n\n THE END\n \n",

Kurask? Kosack? Kurst? - Silverbrow Human Paladin** (of Bahamut), drawn to Fortinbras's small church of Bahamut, they don't always see eye to eye but fight for the same cause. Has a mighty Drakkensteed and uses a lance on horseback, rapier and shield when off.  \n**Roku - Mineral Warrior Human Crusader Barbarian**, cursed by Drow to be a stone slave, broke free and joined the adventurer's guild. Woe betide any foes who get within his reach, his one handed chain weapon dragging foes to the floor and his combat reflexes keep them there.  \n**Stanley - Human Warlock**, likes to fly and shoot eldritch energy at folks from 250ft away. Has adopted a human skull from a store called \"spirit guides\" and now has a human ghost companion with a strong sense of amnesia who is going to guide them to Hades...  \n**Azrael - Human Sorcerer**, magical rival to Stanley and all around nice, if stupid, guy. Has all the charisma in the world and no idea what to do with it. Has a blinkdog familiar and hits enemies with pretty colours.  \n**Baha Abdur - Human Duskblade**, his other name is Warrior of God or something about Storms, a mercenary forced out of his old troupe, almost killed but saved by Stanley, he is a force to be reckoned with, power attacking with a huge Glaive covered in spells, or helping Roku trip foes.  \n**Norril - Human Cloistered Cleric of Olidammara**, He is a member of the thieves guild, an adventurer, a Cleric...and he pursues stolen knowledge with a passion. He wields the Kingmaker: Merthuvial, a long black adamantium sword that radiates magic, and has unlocked a couple of the rituals. He has a couple of npc thieves that followed him, an apprentice and a cohort.  \n  \n  \n**The first session after the timeskip.**  \nPlayers are summoned to the Adventurer's guild, those not in the city are sent scrolls that teleport them to the guild. Everyone knows that they are being summoned to rescue Asimov (Roku's previous character, unarmed swordsage [who is trapped in Hades](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/25jdzm/35e_story_the_battle_of_the_cathedral/)) Everyone is gathered and only Norril is absent. The Guildleader introduces them to a gnome that explains the great wheel. After frantic note taking and questions he takes his leave and the guildleader explains a Druid, A Planar Druid of the outlands can take them to the outlands, this is a better plan than any of the ritual incantations they have, which lead to planes such as the quasi-elemental plane of lava...  \nThe Druid has agreed, under certain conditions that the guildmaster has agreed to, such as assistance setting up a trade route to Sigil from the city (Valysar) in the prime material. The Druid has also gone missing. The party waste no time and are teleported by the guild mages to the Druid's glade. The Druid is there, bound and gagged, they remove the gag and the Druid introduces himself \"You fools!, It's a trap!\".  \n**Ambush Encounter**  \nThe players take Volley damage. I do Volley damage like this:  \n(((Number of Archers)X(Damage Roll))/(Number of Targets))/D100  \nIt seems cumbersome but it was really 20 x 1d6+1, so 20 x 5 for example, so 100, 8 targets, so 12 ish, and rolled percentiles, 30% means everyone takes 4 damage.  \nSo the players hear that arrows rain in from all sides and land about them, narrowly missing them and sliding off armour. As they do so they feel necromacy come from the woods and strike the Dragonborn but he passes his save. The party book it, they move to the magic circle, dragging the Druid and they unbind him to teleport them out of there, as they do so they see skeletal knights moving through the woods.  \n  \nThey teleport out, cast some buff spells, and go right back in.  \n  \nThe planar druid goes full Bear form and rushes a formation, the skeleton knights are in four formations of 5, each with a second row of archers, Roku moves in and begins to introduce the knights to the floor. Baha Abdur decides to jump onto the bear's back and ride it, swinging his glaive at the foes. The Dragonborn spots the necromancer... an evil (blue) Dragonborn, and commands his wyrmling to use it's paralysing breath on the necromancer. I roll a 1. Well The necromancer is out for six rounds.  \nThroughout those 6 rounds there is much combat as they cut through the ranks of the ambush, bringing in the knights into the killzone to reduce the volley damage and killing the archers too.  \nIt doesn't sound like much but 3-6 damage per round unavoidable on a level 6 is quite deadly... except for Roku with his DR/8 -.  \nStanley's player is acting like a bellend so he ends up covered in bees from the tree he's flying around at about 100ft to avoid the hail of arrows and he manages to kill a skeleton with a beehive after toning down the behaviour.  \nThe players capture the Dragonborn alive, take him back to Valysar and lock him up in the wizard's university (The Academy of the Indefinite Arts) basement for later questioning as he's babbling about copper chalices and custodians, tiamat and that she'll eat them alive.  \n  \nThe Druid teleports them to the outlands and they arrive in the middle of a field of cabbages.  \n  \n**Session 2**  \nThe players follow the Druid throughout the farmland, he knows they are close to the gate-town, Tradegate, and from there they can get to Sigil. During the journey they are approached by men on horseback hunting demons in the area. After some decent diplomacy and whatnot the two groups head off in separate directions.  \nThe group arrives at Tradegate and tries to do some shopping, but it's too confusing for outsiders, and too expensive to get an insider. They do find a map of Hades, but it's basically all their money, they decide to come back to it later if need be.  \n  \nThe Druid takes them to the portal for Sigil, they need to be holding a coin and they pass through into [Sigil, the city of doors.](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081231234508/forgottenrealms/images/c/c0/Sigil_-_Jason_Engle.jpg) Now Sigil sits [atop of the great spire](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30280/1479160-planescape_the_outlands.png) and there it just [floats](http://thecage.wdfiles.com/local--files/start/CoD.jpg).  \n  \nThey arrive in Sigil and the planar druid leaves them, he gives them his details should they need him and goes off on his business.  \n  \nThe players look around for an inn, a library and generally somewhere to get settled in and started when they all develop migraines. Around them people are dropping like flies with their heads held in pain. The party feels compelled to enter a small shop, as they get closer to it the pain subsides... Stanley tries to move away and the pain intensifies, he almost passes out and he moves toward the shop to make it go away.  \n  \nAs they enter the pain vanishes and they look around the empty, dusty and seemingly abandoned store. They call out and a voice responds, apologising for the pain, but it needed someone to help. A cat leaps onto the table and my party begin to question it.  \n\"It wasn't me.\" says the cat in a different voice, thoroughly confusing the Party.  \n\"It was I that summoned you all\" says a book, on the table, as it flips open, revealing an imprint of a face on the pages.  \nThe party at this point are acting a little confused...they're having a conversation with a book and a cat after all.  \nTurns out the cat used to be an elf in life. When he died his soul went to the beastlands and became a cat. He doesn't remember his life but the book recognises his soul, he used to own the shop...and the book but the book isn't fully paid for. The cat decides to return the book but needs help in actually carrying it and whatnot....which is where the heroes come in. They decide to help, in order to give the cat peace and return the book to it's rightful owner.  \n  \nThe book tells them they need to go to the Gate-Town of Automata, where the Wizard Heiron's shop is. It gives them directions and instructions on the portal and they proceed.  \n  \nUpon arrival in Automata, they spend three hours registering as visiting bodies, then seek out the wizard...his shop is gone so they go about investigating... whilst being followed by the council of anarchy, a sort of extremely lawful thieves guild. When they find Heiron the Council attack too, as he's gone into hiding from them... a short kerfuffle later during which Azrael attacks someone with a [Rainbow](http://dndtools.eu/spells/spell-compendium--86/rainbow-blast--4057/). There is an Earthquake, Heiron panics, drops a cloud of fog in the room and begs the party to follow him, he takes them to a rooftop nearby (during this escape they bump into Norril, grab him and go) and they watch as thousands and thousands of [Modrons](http://crpp0001.uqtr.ca/w4/campagne/images/Planes/ModronMarch.jpg) March throughout the streets. He explains the great modron march, but he's worried as it's hundreds of years early.  \n  \nThey return the book and are rewarded with the combination to a safe at the property. When they return they discover thousands of gold, old ledgers, magic items, artwork and the deed to the business/property. Not a bad haul.  \n  \n**Session 1.5**  \nNow I mentioned that Norril found the group in session 2, this is because the player missed some sessions and he had a solo one to make up for it.  \n  \nNorril has been tasked by the thieves guild leader to track down some [Khaasta](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/sk_gallery/82325.jpg), a group of lizard like slave traders, bandits and general bad guys. They had come into possession of the \"Thief of Charms\" a rod, capable of stealing and bottling beauty, they were harassing towns on the prime material, stealing beauty and making slaves, then vanishing into portals back to their outlands home.  \n  \nNorril found some Khaasta fleeing a town after an attack and chased them for miles, until they fled into a portal beneath a stream. Norril stepped through into Sigil but took so much time about it he lost the Khaasta, he was near a scribes store, the scribe store the party had used to teleport to Automata, he went in and noticed the portal, it closed and he spent a long time trying to reopen it himself. Eventually he paid a scribe to help and he was off to Automata. He didn't waste time registering himself and he set off looking for Khaasta.  \n  \nWhen the ground started to shake he saw the party run past him, they grabbed him and dragged him to safety with them. He then told them of his predicament with the Khaasta and they agreed to return to Sigil to help him...and check out their new pad.  \n  \n**Session 3**  \nThe party seek information about the Khaasta and Hades.  \nStanley finds Dreyfus, a ghost bound to a skull who promises to guide them to Hades despite his Amnesia.  \nAzrael finds a Duergar who can sell him a scroll to summon a Yugoloth, which he could interrogate for information on Hades.... people stop Azrael because he doesn't know how to safely summon anything...let alone something that would want to wear him as a hat.  \nThe Dragon Duo find the guild of the great worm and talk to The Archivist, an old man who runs the Archive, he promises them a map of Hades and has a scribe make them a copy to be delivered tomorrow. Fortinbras notices the man's grey eyes and they ask the scribe how long he's been the archivist.  \n\"Well he founded the guild, so, that long at least.\"  \nThey later find out the guild is over a couple thousand years old. They begin to speculate.  \nRoku and Baha Abdur discover Sir Huntsworth Huntington's Hunting Hall and talk to him about the best way to kill a Yugoloth, he gives them some pointers around their immunities and whatnot. They want to join his hall, but he says they need to take a trophy head from something impressive first. His walls are covered in heads, impressive trophies.  \nNorril finds out things about the local thieves, thinking about starting a guild here and also that the Khaasta frequent an area of town.  \nThe party hear screams and question a very plain half elf who had her beauty stolen. They narrow down the search and lay in wait for the Khaasta in a nearby pub, a couple members break off, identify the portal with the help of Dreyfus the ghost, who remembers details of the portal but keeps forgetting his own name.  \nWhilst three of the party are at the store buying a key for the portal the Khaasta come back.  \n[**The Khaasta Fight is here, in this post.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2c83wu/dming_that_satisfication_when_your_players_really/)  \n  \n**Session 4**  \nSession 4 hasn't happened yet, it is tonight, My players have just stepped through the Khaasta's portal and ended up in a dark dank quarry.  I'll do another write up at some point.  \n  \n[Next Session](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2djjc1/beholders_basilisk_blood_and_bumbling_heroes_dd/).",

        "text": "Just got back into the saddle, and picked up a Teamspeak based internet game of Shadowrun 5e - things have changed, and I think for the good!\n\nI'm playing Brian McGillicuddy, a Troll Street Sammy who fled the Emerald Isles for the Emerald City to avoid getting turned into kibble by the father of the lady Troll who may or may not be carrying my Troll babbies.  My goodbuddy is playing Hotentote the homeless Ork shaman, and two relative newcomers to our social group are playing Elliot the human decker and Zack the elven Face.  Our first mission, we show up in the Teamspeak channel and the GM says \"OK, who goes in the door first.\"\n\nTurns out to be the homeless Ork.  You all actually have more background at this point than we did, as we'd been prevented from knowing anything about the other characters before this point. \n\nHotentote is first in the door of what turns out to be a Stuffer Shack.  I was expecting a fast food joint (yes, I've read Food Fight), but instead I get a 7-11.  OK.  Hotentote, being a homeless broke Ork dude, makes a beeline for the cut-price damaged/expired goods rack, looking for something that isn't going to give him the runs.  \n\nZack is next, and not having any clue what's going on at all, he nods to the human lady with the air-raid siren of an infant on her back and starts inspecting the candy isle.  Out of character, I'm a little nervous - are we going to have some pointy eared little bitch with a drug problem on our team?  I'm relieved though, when he starts making noises about a particular brand of candy that uses the left-handed isomer of caffeine, and the GM chimes in that \"yeah, that's a little bit of the buzz without sticking your face into the Dreaming.\"\n\nPhew.\n\nThe third member of our merry band is myself, and I duck my head to make it through the undersized door keeping me from the holiest of holies.  I spare not even a glance for the howling infant or the pile of stank shuffling through year-old soycakes, I have priorities. \n\n\nIce Cream. \n\n\nElliot is pulling a bag of Sea Salt &amp; Vinegar flavored soychips off the shelf and I'm attempting to get the crazy man to stop opening the cartons of ice cream and putting his finger in them (without removing his finger from his hand or his hand from his arm) when the car bomb out front goes off, and the front of the store turns into a crime scene.  \n\n\nThe shelving and the tough klaster take the brunt of the explosion, but Elliot and Zack are pinned under the twisted steel.  Since we don't know them from Adam, me and Hotentote don't care.  \n\nI leave my ice cream with a regretful sigh and turn to leave, only to find an angry man with a cyberarm gesturing with a pistol and saying something about the girl coming out and no one gets hurt, stupid crap I honestly didn't care about.  I tried to convince him to stop whatever he was doing and go away, and he shot me in the chest with an Ares Predator.  \n\nI didn't like that.\n\n\nSo I hit him with my 7' Troll-sized crowbar.  A \"pool cue\" strike in the face, with a stack of boxcars that makes me grin like an idiot, and down he goes like a sack of doorknobs.  Hotentote is facing off against a dwarf magicker of some sort, and a piece of advice I'd gotten somewhere along the line bubbles to the top of my rage-clouded mind: First thing, geek the mage. \n\nI take a single step forward and plant my walking stick in the wreckage of the chromeboy's face, cracking the tile his head was resting on and earning a moment of shocked silence from the rest of the group.  Hotentote is the first to recover, sparing me a nod and asking one important question.\n\n\"Knights in shining armor?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know about shiny...\"  I reply, and take a swing at the dwarf.  The stubby little bastard manages to dodge, and it is in fact on.  The damn dwarf's attention is firmly on me, and the trollhide that had turned his partner's attack earlier proves just as sturdy against his mana bolt. I can't help but grin as I make another strike, but my plans are foiled by his unnatural swiftness and he dodges.  Hotentote distracts him with a mana bolt of his own, and I reiterate my frustration with his slippery nature by missing a sweeping strike with my happy stick. \n\nThis draws the dwarf's attention enough that he decides to neutralize me with an ice spray to the floor and a disorientation hex on my person.  To my dismay, this works - I spend the next several rounds unable to do anything more effective than stand up and fall over.  Another piece of muscle, this one with an AK, ruins Zack's day as he's trying to get him and Elliot free of the shelves.  He's down and bleeding out, Eliot is cowering behind the register with the clerk and some civvies, and AK man is drawing down on Hotentote while I do my rock lobster impression on an ice slick.  \n\nNot the best day for Our Heroes.  \n\nHotentote decides to even the odds, and summons a spirit.  This guy's a real Rock Lobster, a stone and crystal Earth Elemental scorpion.  AK guy gets some crystal needles to the face and starts screaming, then Hotentote has his Rock Lobster dissolve dude's face with an acid spray while he knocks the damn dwarf ass over teakettle with a mana bolt.   \n\nTables turn again as the last member of the group, a human decker, runs into the store.  Elliot has overcome his natural and sane urge to claw his way through the floor and away from this madness, and fucks up the dude's life deck to deck.  Seeing his last group member hit the floor spazzing out as soon as he runs through the door does a number on the damn dwarf's morale, which isn't helped at all by the AK dude choking to death on the dissolved remains of his own facemeat.  \n\nHe breaks.  Stubby little irritating arms in the air, all his magic ended, \"I surrender, waaaah\"  \n\nI'm infuriated by this.  I get back to my feet and find myself with a distinct lack of people shooting at me.  I decide to employ a Trollish interrogation technique on the dwarf, and grab him by his ankles.  Holding him up in the air, I bellow in his face.  \n\nIt's super effective.  Unfortunately, he doesn't know anything other than the fact that I converted the person who hired him into the worst throw rug ever - he's the dude with the cyberarm, who is currently making the dairy aisle a biohazard.  \n\nLovely.  I bowl the stubby into the parking lot and tell him to \"GIT!\", which he does.  The gal with the screaming kid comes out of the cooler, where she was hiding with the ice cream poker.  She's trying to thank us and explain what went wrong, and we're trying to do first aid and glue Zack back together.  \n\nSirens in the distance make everything a little more urgent, and we find the enemy decker passed out on the front of a rusty-ass Americar.  Perfect.  Hotentote hides his Scoot behind the store and steals the keys to the Americar, Zack exchanges commlink info with us and disappears into the night, and the rest of us pile into the Americar and vamoose.  \n\nThis works out perfectly out-of-character as Zack's player needs to go AFK for a few minutes, so the three of us have a bit of free-form RP in the car on the way back to my apartment.  The enemy decker is profoundly unconscious, so he gets taped to a chair.  His awakening and interrogation are short, and I serve out some troll-sized omelets and soylinks for breakfast as the sun brightens the smog.  The morning dawns in this low rent trollhome on the edge of the Barrens and I turn to the collection of misfits and murderhobos (literally, in the case of the ork).\n\n\"You know, we worked together pretty damn well out there...  I've been looking for a brace of good lads to watch me back, and I think you lot would be choice... \"",

        "text": "FATE. A game about coming up with awesome bullshit and then exploiting the CRAP out of it. \n\nWe're playing a giant robots in fakey medieval Britain game with a quest to recover **Excalibur**, the bestest robot that ever stepped on a peasant. It's kinda Escaflowne meets the Arthurian legend. Pretty rad.\n\nWe're trying to get the drop on some bandits, and we know they have a Titan of their own, so we figure we'll set a trap to hopefully cripple it, allowing us a slim chance at disabling it outright. We settle on a spike-pit. It's a classic, and fortunately we roll well so it's nicely hidden. We set up a campfire and tether a sheep nearby which will hopefully get their attention.\n\nIt does! The titan shows up with a couple of archers for support. It heads over to collect the sheep... and doesn't fall in the hole. It unwittingly stands right at the edge, reaching over to collect the sheep from the other side.\n\nThat's no good. If it doesn't fall in the hole then the whole plan is a bust and we're down one sheep. So I do what any reasonable person would do: I rush out and shove the robot. \n\nIt's a 25 foot tall wood and metal robot. There's no way this should work. \n\nI have +4 physique. I have two aspects I can tag: \"Always takes the gamble\" and \"Gotta impress Creyah,\" which gives me another +4. I get a pep talk from one part member and some advice on where to strike from the other: another +4. Finally, I roll... +2. A total of 14.\n\nI suplex the giant robot into the hole. Its torso gets crunched and an arm falls off. The blacksmith jumps on top and beats the everloving shit out of the struggling automaton while the inventor shouts insults at the archers receding quickly towards the horizon line. \n\nWe were mighty proud of ourselves.

        "text": "The same party as [You Only Live Once](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2b17iw/tabletop_story_you_only_live_once/) regroups, this time with hopes of sanity. Presumably learning from her \"mistakes\", Raggy's player creates an obnoxious rich girl character, Rosetta, who bails Honza the barber out of police custody.\n\nThe idea is that when these characters meet, much gratitude will be given, and a happy, peaceful party will be formed. But of course, a lot of bad diplomacy rolls later, Rosetta manages to accuse Honza of rape and murder and they end up fighting outside the police station.\n\nThe two characters are unable to make up after the battle due to the emotionally charged atmosphere and Rosetta's insistence Honza is a murderer and a rapist, so they go sleep in the hotel. In the morning, Rosetta stumbles upon Jimmy, the NPC who was getting mugged and ended up unconscious in the previous session. Rosetta rolls for diplomacy, convincing Jimmy that Honza is a rapist, and they decide to talk over what happened the previous day in a café.\n\nThere, Jimmy and Rosetta stumble upon an angered Honza once again, in the hopes of finally forcing Rosetta to come clean and admit she lied, having some positive character development. This is something the player obviously didn't catch on, as Rosetta went on to scream rape in the café, roll insanely high with diplomacy, and convince everyone in the café that Honza was a rapist.\n\nAn angered mob carried Honza to the police station, and they started screaming that he should be tried. At this point Rosetta screamed even more rape, which inspired a mobster to start beating Honza with a chair, cracking his skull. The police bring out their Growlithes, and with a high roll on Roar, they manage to stop the murder of Honza occurring before them.\n\nNow, although there is a limit on how high a player can roll, I have inserted \"limit break\" kind of challenge level that describes forth-wall-breaking extreme effects, assuming characters have perfect rolls plus great modifiers plus something that justifies a limit break.\n\nAnd, you guessed it, Rosetta managed to roll just that with diplomacy. She gives this massive rant on rape culture and how the evil patriarchs over that the police station uphold it by trying to prevent the murder of Honza; a collection of words that would make Andrea Dworkin sound liberal by comparison. As a result, Rosetta becomes the Messiah of this new cult, as they wage war against the police, some of who have defected over to the side of the mobsters.\n\n\"Down with the patriarchy!\", \"Die cis scum!\", and \"Kill whitey!\" scream the mobsters, as their collective firepower breaks the damage limit once again, making the police station collapse immediately and kill all the poor victims inside it.\n\nMeanwhile, Blue had heard the deafening Roar of the Growlithe previously, and was surveying the area from above, on his Fearow. Having learned of the dangers of putting Blue near this insanely lucky player, I decided that my best bet for de-escalation and putting the game back on rails was using Blue's overpowered level 70+ Alakazam to mind wipe Rosetta while on the Fearow.\n\nSince Rosetta had no psychic training whatsoever, nor any Pokémon capable of psychic powers near her, there was no way to defend. Rolling high enough to mind wipe her, Rosetta fell unconscious immediately and suffered amnesia. Then another high roll made the entire mob fall asleep thanks to the powers of Hypnosis.\n\nIronically both Honza and Jimmy survived the ordeal. I swear I'm not making this stuff up.",

        "text": "To preface: So a while ago Relic studio produced this video game adaptation of Warhammer 40k that, while now stuffed with money grabbing DLC, is the most frugal game option for GW fans. The game itself is a company level RTS but they added a mode called Last Stand or Manliness Contests amongst players wherein 3 ~~heroic~~ badasses kick a planet's worth of ass while struggling to not kick the bucket. However as an older game and this niche mode pretty much being like a PVE MOBA with no depth there aren't many players, so queue times are quite long and if you meet 2 other guys, you say fuck all about their terrible builds or choosing to play commanders that don't mesh with the rest of your team, say a squishy caster with no teleports, defensive buffs or area denial.\n\nI haven't played in a while so I just go with what I had last, a Chaos Sorceror with a trollicious build called the Jesus Tagteam: I combine Robe of the Deathless (4 armour compared to 30 average for a  squishy, but revives you with full Health and Mana and gives the same bonus to anything you can Clone), Icon of Greater Summoning (this guy can clone enemy units, but without this it is limited to disposable units, with this he can clone anything including the rare enemy commanders, this is important), Scroll of Blood (summons a nice big aoe which gives ridiculous healing for damage dealt, but the AI isn't so sure and seems to run away like it gives them the plague), Cataclysmic Hellblade (A weapon that doesn't give the CSorc a spell like the others do, while making your attacks cost mana but it could be argued that this makes his attacks into fast casting spells of fatal stabbing wounds) and Accursed Idol (Hit me and you get 100% returned).\n\nSo I goto the matchmaking menu and see in the global chat channel that there are a few people going \"LFG LS BC\", that is they're in queue for The Bloodied Colleseum map, the first of the two Last Stand maps and one that every knows everything about. Its got 20 waves to survive with something ~~special~~ fucking overpowered every 4 waves, although wave 9 and 10 are a notorious difficulty spike and wave 20 is a special kind of hell. I've got experience so I know the plays, kite things out, hold a corner in such a way that everything forms densely packed blob etc...\n\nAnyone I get matched with two other guys, they're mates, mention they got to wave 16 last game, one of the notoriously difficult waves because you just have to deal with three dumb clones of yourselves that have roughly an extra 50% HP and can revive each other like you can. They decide that we should play as trio of CSorcs because its cool or something, they switch and I can tell from their gear that one just got to Level 5 on the Chaos Sorceror, unlocking Icon of Greater Summoning, the other is about 12 and has the Staff of Tzeentch or as most call it the GTFO Stick for its spammable teleport. Alarm bells are going off in my head, see the clones on wave 16 have all your abilities, buffs, gear etc, the difference is their health and being bound to an AI script while you can adapt and improvise on the fly like the avatar of MacGuyver. I've had matches where we had one guy deliberately play a gimped build that the AI bugs out on so that we have an easy wave 16. My build is nasty but I can use Orb of Blood spell to eat tank shells to the groin and stay standing because I'm tearing the crewman's drinking buddy's spine out and stabbing that guy's squadmates with it, while my clone will cast it and run like it gives out syphilis.\n\nHaving 3 clone using Chaos Sorcerors is tempting Fate himself, you know, the Chaos God Tzeentch that Sorceror worships in the fiction.\n\nSo we go in and they at least show some basic sense in cloning the Force Commander on wave 4 and being outlived in every subsequent by those clones until about wave 15 where they heroically bug out between a tower and the edge of the arena and with their last act absorb a cloud of bullets, mine is still alive by dint of my mighty Thong of Flipping Off Death Himself granting him said ability to insult the concept of death.\n\nIn wave 16 I position myself on the farside of the map from their spawn while my friends decide to try and cover other spawns in case the game defies my several hundred hours worth of experience and spawns other units. Meanwhile my AI champion of \"taking it on the chin like a man\" rushes the Clone sorcerors daring them to waste their clone spell on him.\n\nOf course this doesn't happen.\n\nBecause one of the clones has teleport...\n\nSo he teleports next to the player from whom his existence is derived and uses his summon clone spell...\n\nThis clone is an exact duplicate, my Force Commander turns and charges this newly manifested abomination causing its script to prioritize teleporting away, so it lands next to me...\n\nFUCKING NOOOOOOOO!\n\nSo it lands, clones me at a good distance because I'm a higher clone priority with my stupid OP build, I clone my clone, creating 2 of me to beat the fuck out of myself. But I'm a clever motherfucking bastard so naturally my evil clone clones either me or my clone, starting a chain of cloning me and then trying to kill myself. Meanwhile the other players and original evil clones start rushing to where this fan that has been struck hard by the shit is. \n\nAnd what do both players and AI think is the smart thing? To clone the strongest enemy present...\n\nMe. \n\n\n\nAnd this escalated quickly into a pitched battle of me beating myself with myself against myself *(potentially the most violent act of mastubation ever)*. The issue is, normally the AI fails to capitalize on Orb of Blood, but we ended up packed so tightly and the game started to slowdown because it turns out there isn't a cap on clone inceptiondom, that all these blood red colour orbs just popping up meant that the AI was finally using it. It also sucked that everyone could revive each other and every clone had my self-revive built-in (doesn't stack both instances though).\n\nFighting this wave took fucking 60 minutes of laggy, .1 Framerate to endure through.\n\nWe won because the AI clones just created more of me and the two noobs were able to use spells from a distance to whittle numbers down with Doombolt, while I had some luck by also having doombolt in my one spare slot and spent the whole time blasting the ground me to clear myself away from myself because the bot AI wouldn't use doombolt itself if it was in melee combat.\n\nThe next few waves were pretty onesided afterwards, the nooblords just kept away while I led myself to victory.\n\nFinal wave was hilarious...\n\nClones again plus a fucking Daemon, warboss and a Lictor on steroids.\n\nThe Daemon who is normally a big deal got downed fast. The Clone Inception chain went well into our way because one of the guys cloned the warboss and the enemy clones cloned our friendly warboss, stopping their clone chain, while ours couldn't get enough of my evil clone. \n\n\nThis did not take as long as wave 16, though it was practically a still life and I went AFK after 5 minutes, went for a walk, ate a snack and watched a bit of TV returning to see the Victory screen and messages from my partners saying that they are thankful for being carried to such glorious butchery, but never want to \nqueue with me again.\n\nHonestly, I don't blame them.\n\nEDIT: due to buggy touchscreen an attempt at editing a spelling error rearranged the whole text. Fixing now, should take a mimute.\n\nEDIT 2: fixed the text, fuck fixing spelling and grammar.",

        "text": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nContext : this is my first roleplay game every played. At the time of the game, I've been around in my university for a few weeks only, I don't know a lot of people. I decide to go to the school's rpg and boardgames club, since why not? As I arrived, I see they are preparing a Stargate tabletop rpg. The DM was down a player, so he took me in. I didn't know any of the players before that game.\n\nHere's the people involved : \n\n* DM : T. I had no idea of his DM style (which is actually a very open minded one), a bit older than me.\n\n* P : A guy that later became my godfather in the student body. Big fan of roleplaying, japanese culture, and generally badass characters. He already had a character, a jaffa with badass stats, and was our captain.\n\n* J : P's girlfriend. Don't know if she had played a rpg before. Didn't have a character, rolled up a medic with handgun skills.\n\n* F : A fun guy. Didn't have a character, first time playing in this setting, rolled up a oceanologist (yea, I know).\n\n* B : The elder of the club. Has played all games, knows them all, played all rpgs, and he's fun too. Already had a character, a Tok'ra with badass stats.\n\n* and Me : Never played before. So I have to roll a character.\n\nA bit of context : the system is based around a certain number of points to put between str, dex, and int. From those, you derive to other stats. For example dex is divided between agility and \"being good with your hands\". And then, you choose skills. When you roll a skill, you roll the corresponding stat, + your skill value.\n\nFor the sake of understanding, I'll translate the values in d20 range. I don't remembee the exact numbers anyway.\n\nThere were like 40+ skills. Ranging from surviving in nature to oceanology (shout out to F!), melee combat, firearms, alien weapons, driving, electronics, etc. DM tells me \"pick out whatever you like, you already have 2 badass guys in the team anyway\".\n\nSo i set up on Kurt Von Lichtenchtein, ze bodybuilding german psychologist. Think Schwarzenegger with a crush on Freüd. Seriously, i put about 3/4 of my points in strength, the rest in intelligence, and went for maxed out psychology, hand to hand fighting, body language knowledge... and lifting.\n\nYea. Lifting things up. Bodybuilder, remember?\n\n_________________________________\n\nSo, we were a 5 guy stargate team (that alone was weird), our captain was a jaffa (weirder), and 2 of us (me included) didn't know shit about Stargate's lore. A good start.\n\nDM launches the game, we are SG-42 returning from a standard recon mission on planet SOM3THING. As we're still on the ramp, the Stargate closes. A few seconds later, sirens go \"WOOP WOOP\" while a voice says trough speakers \"SG-11 returning to base!\". Everyone steps aside.\n\nNot Kurt. Kurt waitz for his comrades, ready to aztonish them with a well chozen Freüd quote! (Yes I did talk like that. I know, cliché.)\n\nThe gate opens (the DM was king enough to explain to me how the gate actually opened, which gave me a chance to step back to avoid the big particle burst thing that disintegrates you) and 4 jaffa serpent guards step out of the gate.\n\nKurt stands there, puzzled. He shouldn't have been, but at the time I just didn't know that they were the bad guy's footsoldiers.\n\nKurt : \"Hello there! I...\"\n\nDM : \"They shoot you. Roll for damage resistance.\"\n\nMe : \"Oh.\"\n\nI barely stay alive thanks to my awesome constitution. While I agonize on the floor, the rest of the team quickly dispatch the invaders, thanks to the Tok'ra and the jaffa's insane stats. I get transferred to the hospital ASAP. Thanks to the insane 90's medicine (plus some DM kindness for the newbie), I'm back on my feet. Onto the mission briefing!\n\nGeneral Hammond informs us that SG-11 was due to return something like 7 hours hours before the attack. The invaders entered SG-11's code to open the Iris. SG-11 obviously wouldn't have given them the code willingly, so they are presumed captured by the ennemy. Our mission is to go to the planet SG-11 was exploring, find out what happened to them, and bring them back home if they're still alive.\n\nWe get geared up : standard rifle + handgun, medkit for everyone, science equipment for the humans, the Tok'ra and the jaffa get their Goa'uld staff. We of course get some food rations, including amongst other things some snickers bars. Remember those, they get important later.\n\nOh, and they gave us some C4. 2 charges for everyone. As I said, a good start.\n_________________________________\n\nThey send a probe through the stargate, nothing to report, no activity whatsoever, its a jungle world. And here we go!\n\nAs soon as we arrive, the captain orders a full on search of the area. After a good 10 minutes of dice throwing, we all report to the captain. Reports are as follows :\n\n* J reports that there's a trail going from the stargate into the jungle.\n\n* B reports that there's some traces of a fight, with both firearms and goa'uld staff weapons. Its likely SG-11 was ambushed when they got out or were returning to the stargate.\n\n* Kurt reports that this forest reminds him of a particular allegory that Freüd mentions in one of his books.\n\n* F reports that there is no hidden ocean around.\n\nAfter the captain and the DM facepalms, we set off on the jungle trail.\n\n_________________________________\n\nAfter walking for a few hours, B (who's scouting ahead) warns us of two men walking towards us on the trail. The captain orders an ambush. So the two poor guys (dressed like peasants) suddenly see five soldiers poiting weird metal things at them appearing out of nowhere.\n\nWhen suddenly : idea! As the captain approaches to talk to them, I sneak to his side and whisper : \"Kaptain, I could uze my training to try and analyze their behaviour.\" \"Yea, you do that\".\n\nP then starts to roleplay the whole dialogue. Apparently they are merchants carrying some pottery crafts to a city 2 days of walk from here. They came from a trading outpost, 1 hour to the north of our position. The outpost is heavily guarded with jafa, and there are rumors of a captured group of unknown demons being detained in it. Meanwhile, i'm throwing buckets of dices, continuously telling the DM how I look for facial muscles, body language, analyze their sentences, their reactions, where do they look, how do they stand, everything.\n\nThe captain lets them go, then turns to me, waiting for my input. The DM goes \"Ok, you'll have to come with me.\" We get out of the room while the table goes \"Niiice, he'll get a bunch of important intel!\". As soon as we get out, the DM closes the door, turns to me, and says : \"After all your carefull analysis, you manage to pick up one thing : They were scared to death.\"\n\nFast forward 5 mintues of me roleplaying a bunch of psycho-nonsense before ending with a proud : \"On thing iz sure, zey were scared.\"\n\nUnanimous facepalm while the DM burst out in laughter.\n\n___________________\n\nWe get to the outpost. There's 4 serpent guards at the door. Apparently, traders are free to come in and out. Fast forward a solid 30 minutes IRL waiting for someone to get out, stealing their clothes, and infiltrating the outpost. We only got 3 set of clothes, so the Tok'ra and the jaffa decide to climb the wall as soon as night falls.\n\nNow comes the fun part : pretending you're a normal merchant when you have the most cliché and heavy german accent ever heard by human ears. Fast forward 2 IRL hours of snooping around, only to learn that one wing of the outpost is closed to anyone but the jaffas, and that the rest is just bedrooms, a kitchen, and a temple to the BBEG where one jaffa guard is praying.\n\nWhen suddenly : idea! Let's knock him out and steal his uniform. We dispacth him, the captain puts on the uniform, we congratulate each other for our swift execution.\n\nWhen suddenly : realisation! We've got a body to hide, and every other room is occupied by some idling traders.\n\nBut no worries, Kurt has a plan. I tell the other guys to bring out as many people as they can in the central patio so I can make a diversion. As I don't want this to critically fail, we plan for 2 contingency distractions for those who wouldn't find the first diversion diverting enough. The captain (in uniform) positions himself near the outer gate, in case something happens.\n\nAs everyone assembles, I climb on a bench, and start alking about Freüd. Roleplaying to the best of my abilities, I describe the philosophy of this genius that Freüd was, how his work allowed us to understand better what it meant to be a human, our relationship with the others, our place in society, etc.\n\nOf course, the jaffa guards react immediately and start wondering what the heck is going on. That's when P just pops at their side saying \"It's ok, I'll handle it\".\n\nOf course, a few people wander off, but they are immediately caught between F's oceanologist who desperately seeks a gardening teacher (don't ask me how he got the idea), and J's offering of a \"free taste of this delicious and exotic meal\" (aka the Snickers from our rations (told you they were important)).\n\nMeanwhile, the Tok'ra is litterally just pulling the naked jaffa guard to the back of the patio, where he dumps him in a bush.\n\nThe DM has us roll of it, with a grim this-is-so-going-TPK-faster-than-planned smile. 5 rolls, one for each of us (the tok'ra had to \"roll for how you stealthily pull a knocked out guy in the middle of a crowd\").\n\n19, 19, 19, 20, 20. (That is the luckiest series of rolls I've witnessed to this day.)\n\nEveryone burst out in laughter, high fives are exchanged while the DM double facepalms. He told us later that he had set the roll to \"anything lower than 18 fails the whole thing\".\n\nAnd that is how we managed to distract an entire outpost full of traders and jaffa guards by talking about Freüdian psychology, gardening lessons, and offering a free tasting of snickers bars.\n\nThe game ended with us blowing the heck out of the trading post (thanks to the C4 the oceanologist planted everywhere while recieving his gardening lessons), a car chase in the forest with a goa'uld death glider raining death from above, and an epic Expendables kind of escape with us dashing through (or getting carried through, as far as I'm concerned) the stargate.\n\nBut that's a story for another time.\n\n_________________________________\n\nTL;DR : The PC playing a SG team infiltrate a trading outpost and distract every human and jaffa guards inside by giving a speech about Freüd, asking for gardening lessons and offering a free tasting of Snickers bars.",

He immediately snapped his head back towards the gate only to witness the horror that was about to unfold.\n\nScrappy was approaching the gate in what looked to be an admiral's uniform (To this day, no one knows how he got it) with his back upright, hands behind his back, and his chin raised slightly upwards. The guards quickly took up battle positions upon seeing this, their eyes filled with terror. This terror was soon replaced with confusion at the sight of such a well-decorated ork.

Rubbish! \"I'm calling security\"\n\n\"Hold it right there, bitch\" He said while crushing the guards gun \"I am a Super Admiral, a title that, I might add, totally exists\"\n\n\"Bullshit! Theres no such rank in the database!\"\n\n\"That is, because, it is so intimidating, that it must be kept secret, a bitch\"\n(One Crit success bluff check later)\n \n\"OH! I'm sososo sorry sir!\" Said the guard. His colleague however, was not as foolish.\n\n\"That's bullshit, I'm calling the commander\"\n\n\"A-look here, buddy\" Zork said \"You're lucky I don't drag the commanders ass down here and send all three of you out the airlock and exterminatus you're respective home worlds, you a-tiny prick. I will rain hellfire down on you that rivals the eye of terror. Now let me in.\"\n\nThe guard pissed himself and let our green hero and his comrades through\n\nFaux shot asked \"How in the emperors name did you pull that off?!\"\n\nHe simply said \"Da powa ofa supa admiral, boss\"\n\nThus the legend begins\n\nTo be continued in part 3!",

        "text": "Here's a little story from our custom Skyrim campaign.\n\nPCs :\n\n* Orion : Assasin type breton (humanoïd), only kills baddies, general friend of the people. Skilled in melee fighting, stealth, disguise. Has a seldom controlled teleportation power.\n\n* Likshil : A Khajiit (feline / humanoïd) thief, friend of the people, likes to steal all the noble's dirty secrets and turn the whole thing against them. Insanely skilled in acrobatics, athletics, stealth, general thieving stuff, but completely useless in combat. He's also a notorious criminal, with wanted posters and everything.\n\n\nAs the PCs were investigating a possible murder in Solitude (capital of Skyrim), Orion breaks in some low noble's house, looking for clues. He searches everywhere, finds nothing. As he's resting in the couch, his teleportation activates. He lands in the nearby street, on top of a guard patrol. He's immediately taken into custody, and the guards escort him to the city's keep. It's the beginning of the night.\n\nMeanwhile, Likshil has done nothing all day but pickpocketing merchants and nobles, and he's carrying with him a big fat bag of gold pieces, trinkets, and generally shiny stuff. As he's making his way back to the inn where the PCs stay, he happens to see a random guard patrol escorting a random Orion look alike.\n\nOf course, he decides to help. Knowing the city like its backpocket, he takes a shortcut and waits in a perpendicular street for the patrol to arrive. As the guards arrive near his hideout, Likshil sprints across the street, making the big bag of gold cling as much as possible in the process. Confused, half of the guards go after him, leaving the other half and Orion standing there, puzzled.\n\n(Likshil's player showed us OOC how he was picturing the thing. Think of a tex avery cartoon)\n\nExcept that Likshil has an insanely high stealth and athletics skill, plus a bonus when trying to outrun someone in streets that he knows. He looses the guard easily, and trace backs to the patrol, still standing in the same place.\n\nAnd here he goes again, crossing the street the other way, still clinging his huge bag of gold. Orion points at him and goes \"Look, its him again! Go after him!\". He of course rolls an insane persuasion roll, and the gards dash after Likshil.\n\nOrion then looks around, and walks away, whistling in the night.\n\nOf course, Likshil got away.\n\n________________________________\nTL;DR : a PC goes tex avery style on a guard patrol escorting his friend, dangling a bag of gold in front of them and running away as the guards completely forget about their prisonner and chase him.",

        "text": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI DM a custom Skyrim tabletop campaign for my friends. We use the FATE generic system, with some tweaks to fit the Skyrim universe. We're all students, and this is my first time mastering.\n\nFor those who don't know the FATE system : \nIn FATE, every player gets a number of Fate points. Those points are used to reroll bad rolls, get bonuses on some actions, or generally influence on the game universe, the NPCs, etc. Player's get fate points back when they stick to their character's roleplay particularly well, or when an aspect of their character is invoked against them, compelling them to follow that aspect. The goal is to have points flowing between the DM and the players constantly.\nAlso, in FATE every skill roll uses 4d6. Each dice is read in the following manner : * 1 or 2 gives you -1\n* 2 or 3 gives you 0\n* 5 or 6 gives you +1\nSo you end up with a roll between -4 (crit fail) and +4 (crit success), to which you add your skill value.\nWe make all other rolls with a d20, and we have a homemade rules that states that a quadruple 6 or quadruple 1 is a legendary success/fail, further enhancing the effects of the roll.\n\nThe PCs are : \n\n* Orion : An breton (humanoïd) assassin who lost the taste of blood. He now only kills baddies, and generally tries to help the people. Skilled in fighting, disguise, stealth, and craft. He has a seldom controlled teleportation power.\n\n* Likshil : A khajiit (feline/humanoïd) thief who likes to steal the noble's dirty secrets and use it against them, and a general friend of the people. Skilled in stealth, general thieving, athletics / acrobatics stuff. He's a notorious criminal, and he's totally hairless due to an incident with the mage of the group.\n\n* Orok' Gro Grolfim : Orc fighter. As lawfull good as it gets, he follows his own code of honour. A friend of the outcasts, he owns a Daedric 2 handed warhammer of his Daedric patron, Malacath, and he's a general servant of Malacath. Skilled in fighting, crafting. The tank of the group.\n\n* Yennefer : Breton mage. She highly despises Deadras, and generally lusts for power and wealth. After a very heated argument with Orok, he headbutted her in the face, causing permanent damage making her very ugly. She now uses permanent illusion enchantments to make herself look beautiful, and she kept a big hatred for the orc. Skilled in conjuring and illusion, and magic in general.\n\n\nThe story begins when the PCs get to Whiterun, a city in the centre of Skyrim. A dragon has recently attacked the city and was slained, and the PCs came to learn all they can about the dragon.\nThe group wanders off, everyone minding its business. Likshil's player wasn't here for the session, so Likshil wasn't around. Orion and Yennefer go to the city's jarl (aka lord) to get information and speak with the court's wizard. \nOrok, generally not interested by magic, gets bored. he decides to go find some warriors to befriend. He walks in the hall of the Companions, a legendary order of fighters.\nThere are several fighters wandering around. Some of them turn to look at the steel plated orc warrior who just came in.\nOrok : \"Is there anyone here worthy of fighting?\"\nI roll 19. A human mountain of muscles stands up, looking at Orok. He's at least a head taller, and wider than the orc even though he's not wearing armor.\nMuscleMan : \"Still want to fight, stranger?\"\nOrok grins, and replies : \"With or without weapons?\"\n\nThat's when Orion's player intervenes \"One fate point says he's a spanish guy!\". Despite it being totally incoherent, it's so funny I accept. Back to the roleplay, Muscleman goes : \"I must admit, pendejo, you have some serious balls!\". Both him and the orc get out in the training groud and prepare to duel.\n\nNow, what I had planned for this was to give Orok a nice fight, and have him make a friend amongst the companions, which could prove usefull later.\nSo, Orok and Muscleman (which we unanimously agreed to name Carlito) prepare to fight. Orok is using his Daedric warhammer, and Carlito fights with a huge claymore. The fight is hard and lengthy, they are of similar skills and stats. Carlito is bigger and stronger, but Orok's armour and fighting skills is enough to compensate. Everyone is enjoying the show, the other players are cheering for Orok.\nI announce the next attack : Carlito lifts his sword and swings at Orok's chest. \nI roll quadruple 6. Everyone gasps as I describe how Carlito puts all his strengh and resolve into that swing. Orok's players grabs his dices and annouces he wants to dodge the attack.\n\nHe rolls a quadruple 1.\n\nThe table goes silent. We then spend the next 5 minutes laughing so hard we can't even breathe. After we all catch our breath, we start discussing the result of the action.\nBasically, Orok takes 7 point of damage. He has too choose between taking an extreme consequence, thus deeply changing his character (the equivalent of loosing an arm or leg), or take one minor and one sever consequence. He chooses the minor + severe, so he ends up with a \"nearly cut in half\" aspect, and a \"shattered ribs\" aspect.\nI narrate how Orok trips and falls forward, further increasing the impact of Carlito's Claymore on his side. Orok hears the screech of his armour breaking, feels a big hit on his chest, and then everything goes black.\n\nMeanwhile, the other PCs get through with their business and go back to the inn to meet up with Orok. He doesn't show up, so they start searching for him. They found him in the Companion's hall, with a cohort of priests taking care of him and a traumatized muscle mountain crying in the corner of the room.\nAs the priests explain to them that Orok won't be up before at least 6 months, I see Orion and Yennefer's players starting to think furiously. A bit suspicious, I continue to narrate the scene.\n\nThat's when Yennefer goes : \"Ok, guys, he's obviously not getting back on his feet. I say we cut his suffering short and offer him a quick, clean death. We owe him that much.\"\nAt that moment, we had 4 or 5 spectators around the table that were curious about the situation. Hearing that, everyone starts yelling at Yennefer's player, who laughs and shows them one of Yennefer's character aspect : \"Hates Orok Gro Grolfim\".\nMeanwhile, Orion punches Yennefer for saying somethin like that and throws her out of the room. Left alone with the priests, Orion starts a conversation with Carlito.\n\nOrion : \"So, you're the one who did this to him?\"\nCarlito : \"Yes, b-but it was an accident! I didn't wan't to...\"\nOrion : \"Stop it. I don't care. See, this orc was a mercenary I hired to protect me while I travel to sell my goods. I payed him a good 2000 pieces for that. And his service wasn't finished. The way I see it, you now owe me 2000 gold pieces.\"\nOf course, none of that was true. Orion makes his rolls, passes everything, and now Carlito indeed believes he's in Orion's debt.\nEveryone at the table applauds Orion's quick thinking and low morales.\nOrion keeps negotiating, and eventually obtains the right to get a weapon forged by the Companion's legendary blacksmith. He also takes the Orc's armour (I believe it was enchanted, so it was worth a lot) to sell it, and leaves.\n\nSo right now, everyone is still a bit shocked and Orok's player is thinking of a new character since Orok is down for a good 6 months. That leaves Yennefer in front of Orok's door, still thinking. We're playing Orion's quest to sell the enchanted armor when Yennefer's player goes : \"I conjure a lizard!\"\nMe : \"You what?\"\nYennefer's player : \"I conjure a lizard. The size of my fist.\"\nHe rolls, passes.\nYP : \"Now I make him invisible for the next few minutes!\"\nMe : \"What? What for?\"\nYP : \"Don't worry about it.\"\nHe rolls, passes.\n\nYennefer then knocks at the door. Carlito opens, and Yennefer starts apologizing with a heartbreaking speech. Everyone at the table is shocked : she's supposed to hate the Orc, after all.\nIn the middle of his speech, Yennefer's player slides a folded paper to me. The paper read : \"I send the lizard down the Orc's throat to suffocate him from the inside.\" And he keeps roleplaying his speech.\n\nThe other players start suspecting something's up. Orok's player cashes in all his remaining fate points to give Orion a feeling of guilt and make him come back to the room, but Orion's already at the other side of the town by now.\n\nYennefer's speech is interrupted by Orok gasping and making weird noises. Carlito slams the door to her face and rushes at Orok's side while the priests stand aside.\n\nWhen Orion came back, he found that his friend Orok died from his wounds.\n\nThe best part is that Yennefer's lizard just vanished a few minutes after Orok's death. So IG, no one suspects a damn thing.\n\nAnd that is how our orc figher got nearly cut in half in a friendly duel, and met his death by being suffocated by an invisible lizard. Such life.\n\nI'm lucky to be playing with some really nice guys, so this story gave us a good laugh in the end. We still tease Orok's player about his luck with the dices now and then.\n\n_____________________________________\nTL;DR : an orc fighter engages in a friendly duel with the local fighter's guild. I roll critical success, he rolls critical fail. He gets nearly cut in half.\nLater on, the group's mage (who hates the orc due to background stuff) conjures an invisible lizard and sends it down the orc's throat.",

It looked like it was going to be a big one.\n\nLankoris: “Guys… there’s a storm over there.”\n\nWhisky: “Well, let’s ride it out. This is a pretty sweet ship and we have a crew of experienced sailors. What could possibly go wrong?”\n\nLankoris: “A lot, probably.”\n\nWhisky: “I go down belowdecks and get drunk.”\n\nThe storm was moving at an alarming rate, and in no time, it overtook the two ships. Amanduh manned the helm and wrestled the wheel to and fro, trying to keep the ship on course.\n\nAmanduh: “Ah, fuck this. Jizzard, take the wheel. I’m gonna go masturbate.”\n\nAmanduh left the helm under the Jizzard’s control and retreated into the captain’s cabin, slamming the door behind her.\n\nJizzard: “Random sailor, take the wheel. I’m gonna go watch.”\n\nThe Jizzard crept over to the door and peeked in.\n\nAmanduh: “I use one of the skulls I have.”\n\nMe: “Jesus Christ. Okay, you begin rubbing your cooch with a skull as the storm tosses the ship around.”\n\nJizzard: “I’m gonna go peek over the edge of the bed.”\n\nMe: “Roll stealth.”\n\nIt wasn’t very good.\n\nMe: “Amanduh sees you.”\n\nAmanduh: “I look him in the eye and assert my dominance.”\n\nNat 20 for intimidate.\n\nMe: “The Jizzard is absolutely terrified. He gets a raging fear boner.”\n\nJizzard: “You know what? I’m okay with this.”\n\nLankoris: “Guys! Incoming! OH SHI-”\n\nA massive wave crashed over the boat and dragged it into the depths of the ocean. Everything went black.\n\nLankoris: “Wait, did we all just fucking die?”\n\nMe: “You guys wake up on a tropical-looking beach. The waves are lapping at your legs as you lay there in the sand. Debris from your ship is scattered all around you. The sand gives way to a jungle just up the beach.”\n\nWhisky: “Aren’t we in the far north?”\n\nLankoris: “This is beyond strange. Let’s look around and see if we can figure out where we are.”\n\nThe party wandered around the treeline for a bit until they found a crude wooden sign that read “The edge of nowhere”, with an arrow pointing straight into the depths of the jungle. Amanduh led the way, hacking at the foliage with her axe. After a bit of walking, the party emerged into a large clearing. There was a large wooden building in the middle, surrounded by a few small huts. A dreadlocked man in pirate garb stumbled out the front door of the main building with a bottle of rum in his hand.\n\nPirate dude: “Well, I *hic* haven’t seen you folks around here before?” You new?”\n\nWhisky: “What is this place?”\n\nThe pirate spread his arms out wide.\n\nPirate dude: “Welcome, to the Edge of *hic* Nowhere! Best bar on the island! Also, probably the only one.”\n\nWhisky: “If this is a bar, where do you get the money to buy the booze?”\n\nPirate dude: “It’s all free, mate! That’s why this is the best bar!”\n\nWhisky: “I like this place. I go in.”\n\nThe rest of the group followed him in. Inside, several men and women sat at tables drinking and laughing. Buxom serving girls carried some trays full of food and drink out and set them at one of the nearby empty tables. The party sat down and began to feast. Whisky became drunk, as usual, and Amanduh began flirting with a nearby whore.\n\nWhiskey: “I don’t care if this is the afterlife or not. It’s pretty sweet.”\n\nSuddenly, the Tarrasque crashed through one of the walls.\n\nIt was about the size of a duck.\n\nThe Tarrasque roared and began devouring one of the tables. Several more Tarrasques broke through soon after and began eating, well, just about everything. People started screaming and running out the door into the jungle.\n\nLankoris: “What the hell are those things?”\n\nMe: “You hear someone laugh and say ‘Would you rather fight one Tarrasque-sized duck, or a hundred duck-sized Tarrasques?”, but you can’t quite tell who it is.”\n\nThe bar began filling up with Tarrasques. Everyone sat there, dumbfounded, until the Tarrasques ate the chairs out from under them. Whisky began ineffectively kicking at a few of them.\n\nWithin a minute, the entire bar had been devoured, leaving nothing in the clearing but four very confused adventurers and one prostitute. The Tarrasques retreated into the trees.\n\nWhisky: “I don’t think I like this place anymore.”\n\nAmanduh: “Well, we can’t just stand around here, let’s go see what the hell is going on in this place.”\n\nWith the hooker hanging onto her elbow, Amanduh led the group through the jungle in a random direction. After more walking, the group came upon a small house. They examined it, and after determining that nobody was home, kicked the door down. Inside, they found themselves in a kitchen. Three bowls of porridge lay upon the table. The prostitute squealed with joy and began eating one.\n\nWhore: “This one is too hot.”\n\nJizzard: “Oh, no.”\n\nWhore: “And this one is too cold.”\n\nJizzard: “Please, no.”\n\nWhore: “And this one is juuuuuuuuuust-”\n\nA bear crashed through the door. The prostitute screamed and jumped out the window. Whisky, charged forward and punched the bear. It exploded, splattering everyone with gore.\n\nLankoris: “WHAT IS HAPPENING?!”\n\nThe party ran out of the house and back into the woods. They ran into a little girl in a red cloak carrying a basket.\n\nLittle girl: “Oh, hello. I was just on my way to my grandmother’s house.”\n\nLankoris: “GET THE FUCK OUT OF OUR WAY, CREEPY LITTLE GIRL!”\n\nThe party kept running, passing what appeared to be a large wolf scratching at the door of a red brick house, and eventually ended up at the mouth of a cave.\n\nWhisky: “Ah, the answers must be in here. Let’s go in.”\n\nThe Jizzard pulled out a torch and descended into the cave. As they went deeper in, it began to twist and turn, and as they rounded one of the corners, they almost bumped into a scrawny creature in a loincloth. It stared at them with its large eyes.\n\nCreature: “What’s this, Precious? A hobbitses?”\n\nWhisky: “Just kill it.”\n\nJizzard: “Wait, I’m a halfling. I know what to do. So, uh, do you like riddles?”\n\nGollum: “Oh, we loves riddles!”\n\nWhat followed was almost word-for-word the riddle scene from The Hobbit. It was pretty fun. After “What do I have in my pocket,” the group ran out of the cave.\n\nJizzard: “Wait, I check my pocket.”\n\nMe: “You find a ring.”\n\nJizzard: “I put it on.”\n\nMe: “Your finger turns invisible.”\n\nJizzard: “Oh, I am so keeping this.”\n\nOn their next trudge through the jungle, the party found seven dwarves singing about how they were going to work.\n\nWhisky: “Okay, if they’re going to work, let’s walk in the opposite direction.”\n\nThe party did so and came across a large tower. It had no doors, but a long blond ponytail came flying out of a window at the top and hung a few feet above the ground.\n\nLankoris: “Fuck it, I climb it.”\n\nLankoris struggled his way up the long hair until he finally reached the window and heaved himself through it. The person the hair was attached to was male. He had pointy ears and his eyes glowed green. With a laugh, he snapped his fingers, causing the hair to retreat back into his scalp until it was about shoulder-length. It turned black and appeared to be oiled back.\n\nLankoris: “Who the fuck are you and what the hell is this place?”\n\nGlowing-eye-dude: “Oh, where are my manners? Welcome to my domain. You may call me the Lantern King.”\n\nThe Lantern King snapped his fingers again, and the rest of the party appeared in the room.\n\nLankoris: “So, what, are you some kind of trickster god?”\n\nThe Lantern King smiled.\n\nLantern King: “You could call me that, if you wished. You know, I’ve been watching you four for some time, and I must say that you are some of the most interesting mortals I’ve seen in a while.\n\nAmanduh: “So why did you bring us here?”\n\nLantern King: “Because you’re all so terribly amusing! I’m sure you can appreciate a good joke as much as I can.”\n\nJizzard: “Heh, yeah. Anyway, while we’re here, do you think you could tell us what this amulet is from? We haven’t been able to figure out what it does.”\n\nThe Lantern King’s expression darkened for a second.\n\nLantern King: “If you’ve got that, you’ve befriended entirely the wrong sort of people… or robbed entirely the right sort of people. Either way, all I’m going to say is that the people who once owned that amulet aren’t very nice.”\n\nAmanduh: “So, how do we get home?”\n\nLantern King: “That’s simple. All you have to do is play a little game.”\n\nAmanduh: “What kind of game?”\n\nLantern King: “The best kind. A drinking game. One of you has to out-drink me. Sound fair?”\n\nWhisky: “I accept this challenge. Bring it on!”\n\nThe Lantern King snapped, and a table with a bottle and two glasses materialized in front of him. Now, what Whisky didn’t know was that the Lantern King’s brew of choice was the Grog of Substantial Whimsy. For those unaware, it’s a magical beverage, and whenever someone drinks it, one out of a list of one thousand things can happen. These effects range from unfortunate to mildly amusing to absolutely game-breaking.\n\nThe Lantern King poured two glasses of grog and slid one over to Whisky, who promptly knocked it back. I rolled a d1000.\n\n132.\n\nWhisky suddenly grew a massive beard that reached down to the center of his chest. On a minotaur, it looked a bit silly. The Lantern King chuckled softly. Whisky took another drink.\n\n424.\n\nThe grog hit Whisky a bit harder than he expected, and he sat on the edge of the table to steady himself. The table grew wings and flew out the window, sending Whisky sprawling onto the floor. The Lantern King began laughing heartily as Whisky took another drink.\n\n884.\n\nWhisky began coughing uncontrollably. After a few deep hacks, he actually coughed up one of his lungs, which splatted on the ground. Thankfully, he passed the fort save and was able to quickly grow a new one.\n\nThe Lantern King doubled over laughing. After a few seconds, he stood up and wiped a tear from his eye.\n\nLantern King: “I knew there was something special about you guys. I haven’t been this entertained in… well it’s been a long time. Have a pleasant trip.”\n\nThe Lantern King snapped his fingers one final time, and the party found themselves standing on their ship in the exact place it was just before the storm hit, but there was no storm nearby.\n\nJizzard: “We will never speak of this again.”",

        "text": "\"In the grim dark future of the 41st millennium, there is only war. Also shenanigans\"\n~Our GM\n\nOnce upon a time in the land of the 41st millennium there was an ork named Scrappy. Scrappy was a regular ork boy who yearned for adventure and excitement. He spent his days looking up at the stars and studying human culture from afar, intrigued by the squishy 'umies. This routine was followed daily for many years, until one fateful afternoon. He noticed a rather large Rogue Trader vessel by the name \"Argentus Cornix\" and several intriguing fellows exiting the recently docked ship.  Peeking his interest, he decided to investigate. He snuck his way on board via the cargo bay as the workers were unloading. Once inside, he was amazed by the wondrous contents. He saw Weaponry, vehicles, exotic creatures, and an old boot encased in class with a holy aura around it (Story for another time). While wondering the labyrinth of exotic goods, he ran into a rather handsome tech-priest (This guy). Startled for a moment, they both exchanged a blank stare for a brief amount of time. After realization kicked in, the tech-priest promptly tazed our green hero. Subdued and restrained, the young ork was brought before the captain. The man identified himself as Faux Shot, a proud man from the far off planet of Vostroya. After exchanging a few formalities and insults referring to each others mothers/spores, the two reached an understanding and the ork was allowed to join the crew.\n\nMany years after this, Scrappy was having trouble making a name for himself among the stars. He had saved worlds, ended wars, and blackmailed planetary governors. Unfortunately, these were average feats among rogue traders. He was desperately searching for a way to gain fame. He would eventually get his chance in the form of a formal dinner party for rogue trader's and their crews.\n\nAlas, the crew had ulterior motives for attending this gathering. The crew's mission was to infiltrate the station where the event was being held and steal classified documents from the station-commander. The plan was to have the more refined members of the crew mingle at the party while a infiltration team went in to retrieve the documents. The teams were set and went on there way. Unbeknownst to them all, this would lead to Scrappy's defining moment.\n\nTo be continued in part 2!\n\n ",

        "text": "(Meta: This story is based on a playthrough of Fallout: New Vegas that I've just begun. Some minor details have been changed for storytelling purposes. But the events in the story will, on the whole, reflect how things in the game turn out.)\n\n\n\nYou've heard the story a hundred times before. A courier, a chip, a gun, a bullet to the head. My story has been told and retold so many times that even I get the details fuzzy. But now it's time for the story to be told in full. \n\n\nA few of the details you might've heard before. I won't dwell on them. I was hired to deliver a package to The Strip in New Vegas. I failed. I was shot and left for dead. The following is a detailed account of my actions since that day. This is not meant as a defense of my actions, but a true account of how things came to be the way they are.\n\n\n**Awakening:**\nThe pain was unbearable. All I can remember from the beginning are flashes, an elderly gentleman working above me. The world was a blur slowly coming into focus. \n\n\n*\"By God...\"* the old man looked down at me. *\"You're awake! I never expected...\"*\n\n\nI tried to speak but could only mumble. \n\n\n*\"Hold on Son, let me get you some water.\"* He walked into another room of his run-down house and returned with a chipped mug  full of water. I took it and drank deeply. The water was decrepit, it tasted foul. But, this is how most water tastes now. Rare is the day when fresh water is found. \n\n\n*\"Thank you. Wh-where am I?\"* My voice was hoarse and my head was throbbing.\n\n\n*\"This is the town of Goodsprings, and my name is Doc Mitchell. You've seen some shit, boy.\"*\n\n\nI looked up at him. He was smiling.\n\n\n*\"But it looks like the worst is over. You should be healing up nicely now. It'll probably take some time before you're up to snuff.\"*\n\n\nI sat up and sipped on my water. *\"Who shot me? How long have I been out?\"*\n\n\n*\"I don't know anything about that. You might want to ask Sunny, in town, she keeps watch over things around here - or try the bar. There is always gossip to be had there. But if I were you, Son, whoever it was, whatever they wanted. Forget it. Whatever God there is in this forsaken world has given you another chance at life. Don't go and fritter it away chasing after foolishness. Settle down some place and try and work out whatever kind of life you can.\"*\n\n\nI looked back down at my water. *\"I don't remember much about before the attack. I was making a delivery to The Strip. That's the only bit of my old life I still have.\"*\n\n\n*\"Son, that quest of yours will kill you if you go seeking after it. Goodsprings is a nice little town. Why don't you settle down here for awhile? Take some time to regain your footing before you go off on the chase.\"*\n\n\nI started to protest, but he continued.\n\n\n*\"Go talk to Sunny, she can help you get situated. The whole town has been waiting to meet you anyway. You've become something of a local legend. You'll find we're not such bad folks here in Goodsprings.\"*\n\n\nI stood up and he shook my hand. *\"Welcome back to Hell, Son. We missed you.\"*\n\n\n*\"Thank You, Doc. Is there any way I can repay you?\"*\n\n\n*\"Don't go getting shot again! That's all the payment I need! Now get out of here.\"* He walked me to the door. Before I stepped outside he handed my a few supplies. *\"Consider those new clothes and these supplies my way of welcoming you to the community.\"*\n\n\n I opened the door. The light was blinding. I'd been inside for too long. Doc Mitchell's house was up on a hill overlooking the little town. directly to the left was an old gas station that, since the war, had obviously been abandoned. Mitchell put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\n*\"See that old bus right there? That's where Sunny lives. You can find her there, or out behind the saloon. Tell her I sent you to do some work for the town. If you want to repay me you can at least do that much.\"*\n\n\n*\"Thanks again, Doc. I'll talk to her.\"*\n\n\nHe patted my shoulder a few times and looked at me again, but said nothing. I stepped down off of his porch and put on the hat he'd given me. It was cloudy, but the air never feels clean anymore. I guess I pretend the hat protects me from something. But even with second chances at life, we're all dying slowly.\n\n\n**(To be continued...)**",

        "text": "Sorry for the procrestination, I've been busy a lot, with other things I needed to write out and the such, but I'm finally going to sit down and finish this off. Unfortunately, I forget a lot of the exact details that went on the game session, and my internet craped out mid way. But, here we go!\n\n[An introduction to the characters, before we kick things off, though](http://en.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2bwa4j/worlds_of_shadow_and_flesh_prologue/)\n\nThe game starts off with a mild tone, Everyone is living together in sort of a basement, I would described it as Devil May Cry, almost. All the main characters had a \"mini scene\" tieing them into the beginning, and setting the tone. My character has traits in lucid dreamer, and thus has a dream, that's more or less a total nightmare\n\nThere Delilah was, standing in a daycare center, with children playing around. She was in her \"hobby\" outfit (AKA Demon Hunting Trench Coat, Bandit Scarf and Hat). Everything was normal, she sat on a bench with some wokers, and nurses. She didn't talk to them, but she was perfectly harmless. But there was one child that was a bit *off*, and I kept an eye on him. It didnt take long, before he started getting aggressive with the other children, and then his jaw opened unnaturally wide, almost like a Python, literally started to eat the children. Delilah was of course completely caught off gaurd, and looked to the daycare workers. \n\nNot only did they not mind, they infact where laughing at the child being eaten! They took out their cell phones and took pictures. And a few seconds later, their parents walked in and did the same thing, like that child was doing something cute.\n\nDelilah could not stand for this... *thing*. *\"He\"* was  disgusting, a monster, and obviously not human, and It had to be destroyed. Delilah always keeps a weapon on her, and pulled it out. She slowly walked towards this *abomination* and put the gun towards its head, with the half eaten girl still in his mouth crying in pain. No tears shed, no remorse, no sympathy.\n\n*THUD*, and Delilah was knocked to the ground, being tackled by the daycare worker. She didnt hear much words, other than \"Call 911\", \"Psychopath\", \"Insane\" \"Shes gone mad!\" \"Lock her up!\" As the police walked into the door, and handcuffed her roughly a minute after she was called these horrible things, and brought outside. For defending humans, this is what she got. Her reward. She was brought out to an insane asylum, and put into a straight jacket. Then she woke up.\n\nInside her room, everything was quite normal. She was sitting in her Office chair, that was the special one with the squeaky noise when you spin around in. She had a book in her hand, and looked upon her rather ornate bookshelf. She decided reading would take her mind off that \"unsettling\" dream, and what better book to keep your mind off of unsettling events than H.P. Lovecraft? It was sitting on her lap, she might as well read it.\n\nMeanwhile, J and Ravion where just wrapping up their own conversation, and then Ravion attempted to walk into Delilahs room.\n\nDelilah smiled at the door, realizing Ravion tried to eneter her room. That lock she put there herself stopped him from busting into her room roughly 28 times and counting.\n\n\"Hey Dee Dee\" She heard from the door \"We have some important to meet, and its at a dinner! You wanna come with?\"\n\n\"Sure, Ill be out in a second\". She had her reading disturbed, and she gets quite irritated when that happens. She looked around, she didn't have much in casual wear, except for the few clothing items she kept in her night table. She opened it up, a grayish zipper hoodie, some pants, and a black shirt were the first things she saw, and they were good enough, since she wasn't going to be fighting anything, so she didn't bother to bring her suitcase, or her hidden firearm.\n\nShe exited her room, to find that the entire group was ready to go. J offered to drive, and not much happened on the way to the dinner, other than innuendo between Ravion and Delilah, which nearly resulted in Ravion loosing teeth. This is a recurring theme, by the way.\n\nIt was about mid morning when we got there, and they greeted us with open arms, as J was a frequent customer. A *really* frequent customer, and a big spender, since he ordered every single pancake they had, and delivered it to the table.\n\nI don't remember much at this part, but it was mostly fun RP moments here, with a Chef named Ollie, and a waitress named Alena. The person we went to meet did eventually show up. There was much talking I don't remember, but after she left to do something, and Ravion went with her (Again this was 5 days ago, and I was quite busy. Most up close details are out of my head)\n\nBut Siracco mentioned something to the group. That person sent a post card to us (I assume she was close to Ravion) And it said she was quite a way aways from where we were, and she was going to be gone for the week, which raised the question, who was she?\n\nJ decided it was time to leave, and I asked him why, when he hasnt even finished the pancakes (He ate through most of them, surprisingly) but he said it was time to leave. I didnt want to leave, and I wanted to figure out more. Until some supernatural things started to happen.\n\nEveryone at the dinner \"changed\" a bit. It was described as a \"Matrix Glitch\". Everyone else was in different clothing, hairstyles, but essentially, the 20+ individuals where the same 5 people. J was getting worried, and I was to. J grabbed a stool tried to exit the building, but someone grabbed his arm, and his face started to melt into this black ooze.\n\n\"Why are you leaving so soon? The pancakes are *sooo good!*\" *Slam!* J smacked the bar stool into his face, basically knocking him out. Everyone started to panic, including Ollie and Alena. Delilah gets up from her seat, and questions why he just slammed the seemingly innocent man (Only J saw his face melt)\n\nEveryone quickly realized why, as then entire dinner get up from their seats, and turn into roughly humanoids black oozes. And the fight starts.\n\nSicarro immediately starts reading one of his books, and starts yelling out their traits and qualities. Terrified of fire, conventional arms work, and they absorb supernatural powers. And they kidnap humans, to turn them into more of themselves.\n\nThe its Ravions turn, which he summons his sentient pair of dual swords.\n\nThe monsters start maneuvering around us, as they start surrounding Ravion. He gets hit, but takes no damage, but there is two of them on him, and they get to Alena.\n\nMy turn, I counjour my only spell, which shoots both fire and lighting. Instead of discharging it, I use the fire portion to threaten the ones near Alena. But, as I counjoured the fire, not only did nearly every single one of the things cower in fear, but so did Ollie. And Alena fainted on sight. They pretty much split up into small and manageable groups, but I don't have Ol Reliable (My coach gun)\n\nJ's turn, he uses his incredible speed to lung forth at two of the lone ooze things, across the diner. He deals an incredible 10 damage due to a crit!! To put that into perspective, that would deal 8 damage to me, and I have 6 health.\n\nHe splits the damage between them, and instantly destroys them both with his bar stool legs.\n\nInitiative is based on cards handed out, and since the Joker was in play (+2 dice to all tasks), initiative cards are dealt out again.\n\nJ is up again, like the boss he is.. He kneels down, and almost quite literally leaps for the ones that are going for Ollie. He deals another 10 damage crit, (The way the system works, the more dice you roll, the higher chance of a crit... and he rolls a *lot* of dice) and splits them among the ones he jumped over. A few of them die, but most of them are stunned/shocked.\n\nNext is Ravion. He uses use dual swords, and puts all of his weight into his strikes, and then using a minor teleport to dash across the diner and kill more of them.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where my internet crapped. I join back just in time, for Sicarrio to recive an opened rib cage, and from what I hear, Ravion and J completely carried the fight, thanks to them being spread out, and while I was AFK I had the spell kept in charge.\n\nWhen I get back, I check up on Alena, I did invest in medical skills, and I decided to check up on her, and good thing I did, since she was in cardiac arrest. Delilah started to panic, and to be honest I did to IRL. I called for J to help me out, and we we're dragging her outside of the dreaded pancake dinner, and thats when the DM cut off the session.\n\nWell, what did you guys think? Im quite excited to do more, and Ill add a bit more detail next time, and Ill try to write within 1-2 days of the session, which is on sunday.\n\nStay tuned for part two!",

        "text": "It all begins with a story written by a tripcode user on /tg/ I am not the player in the story I will go in the order he posted the stories of Kjellmir and the Kender\n\nIt was a response to a thread asking about their experiences with Kenders with the tripcode user posting this\n\n&gt;My favorite story about Kender: \n\n&gt;I was in a game with a PC who was playing a kender, he took my ring of sustenance while I slept because he thought it would be funny. I didn't pack food or anything because I had the ring. It takes a fucking week to return to your body, meaning I suddenly needed to find food, in a fucking cave. Two days later, I still don't know he's stolen the ring and my character has to beg other PCs for food, which was humiliating. He piped in that he stole it and how funny a joke it was, so I cut him in half with my great axe. The party paladin didn't even try to smite me for it, he just made me make reparations to the kender's family. Nothing brought a smile to my heart like going to what appeared to be a family of children and tossing them a bag with their son's head in it and a few thousand gold.\n\n \n\n \n\nAs it turned out this story is from a single man who went by the name of Wasteland Warrior. A man who had told some of the grandest tales /tg/ has ever  told and he came to expand the story of this Kender.\n\n \n\n \n\n&gt;My favorite story about Kender: \n\n\n&gt;I used to game with a bunch of chuds, mostly because the alternatives were furries or even more chuds. One day I found a group that met kind of in secret, so to avoid the chuds. I joined and we had some fun times, the DM was creative and we meshed well. We had hardcore interparty conflict but we all rollplayed pretty well. One day one of the chuds found out about our game, and the dm let him play, because he had a rule: \"everyone gets at least 2 sessions before he gets the boot.\"\n\n \n\n&gt;The fucker repays his kindness by rolling up a kender rogue, even though our party already had a rogue and a bard/rogue in it. He precedes to steal anything that isnt nailed down, including at one point the paladin's holy avenger. In character we threaten him and tell him if he fucks with any of our shit we will kill him. No one went through with the threat, and the paladin spent his time babysitting him and convincing the rest of the party that even though he was a pain, he was still helping us. \n\n \n\n&gt;He assumed i had nothing of value to steal, (low magic campaign, with the exception of the paladin's badass sword and my ring the only other magic item the party possessed was the bard's flute) untill he noted that I wasn't buying rations when we were getting ready to head out, and i explained I had a magic ring that let me go without rest or sustenance.\n\n \n\n&gt;The little prick took it off of me because he thought it would be funny to watch me get hungry, probably so he would have an excuse to steal rations and give them to me, because shit like that would be endearing or something. I have to beg my fellow party members for food and water, which sucked because the rest of the party was angry at my character for going beserk in battle and killing a XXXXXX.\n\n \n\n&gt;Finally the little asswipe decided to wear the ring in front of me and explain how he was a master thief and how even a mighty warrior could be humbled by a lowly thief. I made good on an earlier promise and charged him (shock trooper ftw) and put the little bastard deep into the negatives. He flipped shit, but the paladin and the rest of the party was happy to be rid of him, and since he did jeopardize my life my murdering him, though an evil act, was understandable. He got really pissy about how Paladins can't adventure with evil PCs and the DM kept explaining DM caveats while the rest of the party, in character, started talking about how it was good to be rid of the vermin and started warming back up to me. In revenge he wrote up a new rogue, \"just to show us.\" Me and the bard ended up getting the rogue lynched in the next session. It took him two more characters to get the hint.\n\nChud 2: Electric Boogaloo\n\n&gt;So decides to roll up an assassin, now with my character being the exception (NE) the rest of the party was good oriented. I know how to play evil characters who aren't just \"hurr durr rape time,\" he did not. He was using some splat book that had bipedal cheetas or something in it and had a massive dex bonus. His new character's backstory was \"he was hired to kill the party\" and that was about it. I didn't know this at the time. I just remember the dm and him having a conversation in whispers while the DM kept sighing. So the nest session starts with us entering the town we were traveling to. We payed for our rooms and our characters had a good meal and plenty of wine to celebrate getting out of the wastes intact, with the exception of the kender who's head i dropped off to his family when i had to make restitutions. We stumble upstairs for a good nights sleap when the new character starts rolling hide and move silent checks.\n\n \n\n&gt;He felt betrayed by the paladin's player and me so he decided to off both of us, but not in a manly or awesome way. He wrapped the paladin's sword handle in hide and took it to my room. He tried to coup de grace me but the dm ruled since he wasn't holding the blade it would be an execution check (from the bovd) and he botched, leaving the sword in my chest but I was still alive. I woke up, grabbed the holy avenger, which burned the fuck out of my arm and left me permanently marked as evil, and tried to kill him with it. \n\n \n\n&gt;He made a run for it and I grappled with him. He was getting away so I told the DM that I was grabbing his tail. I made an attack against it and severed it near the ass. He escaped, but when the paladin woke up he alerted every temple to detain any cat people who came in with a missing tail for questioning. Sure enough me and the bard find him being held at a temple of pelor. The bard convinces the cleric to release him into our custody. We are taking him back to our cleric (who probably would have geased him or something) when the bard gets a great idea (CN actually working for us) that we were somehow more qualified to sort this out, as he tried to kill me and frame a paladin, who was generally beyond reproach.\n\n \n\n&gt;So he writes down an epic speech for my character to read, denouncing the foul hellspawn, and telling of the wonderful accomplishments of the paladin, and how he was helping my character find redemption (which sort of happened, but once again, that's another story), even though I was clearly tainted by evil (the holy avenger turned the skin of my arm all zombie looking.)\n\n \n\n&gt;I delivered the speech, and he starts playing his flute to make my speech sound more believable. The flute allowed him to have his bardic music affect a lot more people then he normally could, and he's making them more and more attentive to what I say. When I finish the speech, the bard stops playing and asks the crowd \"what do we do to murderers?\"\n\n \n\n&gt;The crowd responds with a hearty \"WE HANG THEM\" and they get to work. The bard strings him up and the angry crowd gets him up on a bench. I ask him if he has any last words. He goes on a tear about how we are deluded, and that his gods will make the whole world burn, starting with the paladin and his wretched friends. The paladin, unbeknown to us, heard the entire speech, and walked forward, so that the assassin could look at the man he planned to defraud. \n\n \n\n&gt;He pulled out the sword and told the assassin that if he took an oath before his blade, he would spare him. The assassin responded by spitting on the paladin in front of a crowd full of angry peasants. The paladin detects evil, then uses the sword to destroy the bench, making the assassin drop down. The dm rolled to see if he broke his neck and rolled low, so the fucker spent the next few seconds gasping for air and desperately making strength checks to break the bonds. He didn't make it and died.\n\n\nThus ends the life of the Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dweller or CHUD for short.\n\nKjellmir's story continues on... but I'll post that later. Oh and it includes his Origin story.\n\n\nAll credit for this story goes to Wasteland Warrior from /tg/ board on 4chan",

        "text": "This was my first time GMing a PARANOIA game, and the first time playing for everyone else, so I decided to go with one of the mini-missions published in Flashbacks - Robot Imana-665-C. The troubleshooters are sent to repair a robot in a recently destroyed R&amp;D facility in MEM sector, not knowing it is only a fridge that cannot see.\n\nThe bulk of the mission was the expected turnout - lots of tension building, and misunderstandings, abuse from authority, poor outfitting with bad equipment, and general fumbling to find out what is happening. Craig-R is vaporised by the bots security system for trying to force it open.  So far, so good.\n\nEventually one of my players (C'tri-R, the one with the most general RP experience) works out how to talk to this robot to gain its trust.  He manages to get it to open even though they do not have the right security clearance, and they can examine the bot to find the broken part.  After a successful repair roll, they determine which is the faulty part. \n\nC'tri-R orders the part from PLC, who send a microwave instead.  Craig-R dismantles it for the magnetron on general principles.  C'tri-R orders a replacement. It is the right box, but the wrong part.  Frustration.  C'tri negotiates, and PLC orders they return the faulty goods and a replacement will be sent.  They get the wrong box (and wrong instructions) but the right part.\n\nAt this point Fely-R has to leave to catch a train home.  She marches to PLC and uses her slippery skin mutant power to slide through the service window and confront the unhelpful clerk, who immediately executes here for assault on a citizen of higher clearance. Satisfaction all around.\n\nIt is determined that Iain-R (who's secret society mission is to destroy the bot at all costs) has the highest Bot Ops &amp; Maintenance skill (i.e. 1) and should install the part without instructions.  Perversity points have been building like crazy all game, so everyone throws in to support Iain-R's repair.  However he passes me a note saying he will sabotage the bot instead, bending a contact pin.  The bot is unplugged while he 'installs' the replacement part, then he plugs it in.  I have the bot spark and smoke from a short.  \n\nC'tri-R gets distraught, having bonded with the poor abused bot.  He attempts to put out the fire.  Meanwhile, Ruaidhri-R sends a note asking to use his mutant power psychokinesis to 'MAKE IT BURN' which I do.  The fire leaps up, C'tri-R valiantly tries to save the bot and manages to catch himself on fire, which spreads rapidly all over him.  Iain-R takes a shield and swings it at C'tri-R, in an effort to 'put out the fire' and crushes his head. The fire then leaps to Iain-R, and HE catches fire.  The computer demands a progress report, and debriefings follow soon after.\n\nRuaidhri-R's debriefing is textbook - he sells C'tri-R &amp; Iain-R straight up the river, citing thier direct contact with the bot and C'tri-R's communication with PLC to obtain bad parts.  C'tri'-R doesn't get a debriefing - he is dead at the point of finale, so his new clone has nothing to report. Other briefings similarly name both C'tri-R and Iain-R as the point of mission failure; all other players get fines for destroying valuable Alpha Complex property.\n\nC'tri-R, easily the most loyal and forthright member of the team, and the onyl one to actually progress the mission, is named as the traitor reponsible for mission failure and is publicly censured. Iain-R, however, gets away scot free.  He uses his mutant power Machine Empathy staggerly successfully to get the Computer to side with him and go easy on him.  \n\nEveryone agreed it was a glorious and triumphant night for all citizens of Alpha Complex.  \n\nHAPPINESS IS MANDATORY",

        "text": " Hiya, /r/gametales, I've spent the weekend binge-reading your top posts, and decided to tell you the tale of my current DnD adventure. This will be chapter one of an ongoing series, because I'm still in the process of playing through it. So begins the tale of... The Boner Hill saga!\n\n First off, some clarification- This is only the second campaign I've ever played, and I'm playing with my dad and my friend, Chris. We eventually all learned of each other's love of Dungeons and Dragons, so we finally found some time to sit down and roll up some characters.\n\n We both rolled fairly average, except Chris rolled a 15 in Dexterity, and I rolled a friggin' 17 in Charisma.  Since my only real talent at that point was being courageous and awe-inspiring, I begrudgingly made my character a Paladin.\n\n Anyone who knows me can confirm that I'm kind of a dick, and the second a video game gives me any kind of power, it won't be long before I'm using said power to do ridiculously violent things to the NPCs. My decision to be a Lawful Good Paladin came as something of a surprise.\n\n Of course, I got to make up the deity I worship. And so I chose to be the champion of Stoya, goddess of love, Queen of the Gods, and wife of James Deen, the God of Thunder.\n\n Chris immediately got the reference, but my dad didn't. Chris decided to make his character a samurai-themed fighter class named Tokyo Masamoto. He handed both of us copies of a 10+ page list of Tokyo's various feats and backstory. He didn't want me to post the full list,  but some memorable excerpts include-\n\n- being 60+ year old Japanese man who always wore Ray-Bans \n\n- had a brief fling with Burt Reynolds in the 70's, which ended so bitterly that he doesn't like to bring it up\n\n- when he turned his head a certain angle, he had an uncanny resemblance to a Pygmy Rhinoceros\n\n- he was a midget with gigantism, which brought him to exactly 5' 6\"\n\n- invented the rimjob\n\n So my dad and I are staring at this list, half-shocked and half-amazed. Chris is just siting there smugly, and at that moment realized my character had found his perfect partner.\n\n Then we both rolled for our former occupations. I was thrilled to discover that my character, who was slowly becoming a porn-themed, hypersexual Paladin, was a former jeweler. Tokyo was a businessman, which is coincidentally how Chris described his character anyway. \n\n So we began our noble adventure by hiring a boat captain to take us to the island of Restenford. He dropped us off at shore, and we immediately realized he pickpocketed us, which left us with only the armor and weapons we were had on out backs.\n\n Dad: Alright, you two mark the monetary slots character sheets as 'Zero Gold'-\n\n Chris: Tokyo definitely would've hidden his money in his ass, like the watch in Pulp Fiction.\n\n It took them 10 minutes to argue out how they could roll to figure out how much money Tokyo had in his ass. As entertaining as it was, I reminded them that yen had holes in it anyways, and Tokyo could've just worn it around his neck.\n\n So there we were, with only 10 GP between the two of us, stranded on an island we knew very little about.\n\n Dad: Okay, you're on a decrepit pier,  with two grimy brass lanterns as your only source of light...\n\n Me: Okay, let's go.\n\n Dad: Isn't there anything you'd like to take?\n\n Chris: Are there chests or barrels to loot?\n\n Dad: No.\n\n Me: Then let's go.\n\n Neither of us realized that it was the middle of the night, and pitch black. About 30 feet further, we heard the sound of leathery bat wings nearby. Turns out that we should've taken those lanterns. \n\n Eventually, something bit Tokyo, and  when I went to smack the thing off of him, I was also bitten. So the two of us are fighting two small, fast, flying creatures with a sword and spear. At one point, I accidentally stab Tokyo in the back of the knee trying to swat the damn things, and he nicks my shoulder. After 5 minutes at death's door, we kill the little bastards. We brought the lantern back over, and discovered were nearly killed by two level-two Sturges. (Picture a bat with two sets of wings and giant mosquito heads) We are also disappointed to learn that we can't loot them. \n\n Tokyo and I were panting but triumphant, one step closer to becoming a pair of legendary Badass Motherfuckers. We decided right then and there that we would call our team the Dungeon Buddies.\n\n And, just as we agreed on the name, we heard a rumbling hiss less than 5 feet away.\n\n So, what would you guys prefer to hear next? Part 2, Tokyo Masamoto's backstory, or Sager Hays' backstory?",

        "text": "Link to part 6: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2bc1eb/doing_all_the_wrong_things_for_all_the_right/\n\nThe *Manowar* continued its journey to Horvik bay. The route took them through narrow straits between islands of varying sizes. Whisky and Amanduh volunteered to help row the ship when the wind was weak.\n\nOne day, out from behind one of the islands came a large two-masted ship. It was on a direct course to intercept the *Manowar*. Captain Frodnar ordered Lankoris up to the crow’s nest, as he had a pretty sweet perception bonus.\n\nLankoris: “What do my elf eyes see?”\n\nMe: “You’re able to spot several figures running around on the deck, as well as the fact that the ship is flying the Jolly Roger. ‘The Lucky Maiden’ is painted on the bow.”\n\nFrodnar: “Shit. That’s Von Streuben’s ship. He’s one of those ‘no prisoners’ types.”\n\nFrodnar ordered the crew to prepare for battle. The oars were stowed and the shields that adorned the side of the vessel were equipped. The *Lucky Maiden* was moving at a pretty fast clip, and caught up to the *Manowar* in no time at all, pulling up alongside it. Some of the pirates threw grappling hooks over to the other ship, fastening the two together.\n\nA number of the buccaneers swung over on ropes while a few others laid down a gangplank and charged across it. Amanduh and Whisky jumped right into the fight, while the Jizzard stayed behind everyone and lobbed alchemical bombs at the pirates. Lankoris, still in the crow’s nest, rained arrows down, killing a whole bunch of them. A few still aboard the *Lucky Maiden* picked up crossbows and began to fire at him, but Amanduh boarded the other ship and dispatched them relatively quickly. The three adventurers began to move towards the stern while Frodnar and his crew cleared out the pirates on the bow.\n\nEverything was going pretty well until a booted foot kicked open the door of the captain’s cabin. Captain Von Streuben strode out onto the deck, wearing a flowing red coat and one of those big hats with a large feather in it. His face was covered in battle scars and he had one of those traditional pirate mustache/goatee combos. He was dual-wielding repeating crossbows, and two cutlasses were slung at his waist.\n\nHe began to pepper Whisky and Amanduh with crossbow bolts as they ran to fight him, dealing significant damage to the latter. The dice gods decided that they wanted to prolong the fight, and everyone was rolling really low most of the time. Captain Von Streuben still had a lot of health left when he ran out of crossbow bolts and drew his two cutlasses. He became a whirlwind of steel, and for the first time, Amanduh was knocked unconscious. Whisky was reduced to 0 hp as well, but luckily for him, he had the minotaur racial ability to keep fighting until the point when he would literally die.\n\nMany punches and bombs later, and Von Streuben was getting pretty beat up. From the crow’s nest of the *Manowar*, Lankoris took careful aim, and proceeded to put an arrow right through the pirate captain’s eye.\n\nVon Streuben: “No… I have become… stereotype.”\n\nHe sank to his knees, then fell on his face and died. Everyone rejoiced.\n\nWhisky: “Hoo, boy, I think I’m going to take break now.”\n\nHe sat down on the deck and began to drink. The Jizzard climbed the mast and took down the Jolly Roger, which he used as bandages for Amanduh’s wounds. Then, he climbed back up the mast, and in the place of a flag, he hung the loincloth that he had taken from the ogre back at the old lady’s cabin.\n\nWhen Amanduh came to, she took Von Streuben’s armor, which made her look rather dashing and gave her a decent charisma bonus. The Jizzard took one of the crossbows.\n\nWith a little persuasion from Lankoris, Frodnar agreed to sail the *Manowar* on a skeleton crew, giving the extra sailors to sail the *Lucky Maiden* to Horvik Bay, where the party could sell it.\n\nJizzard: “I search the captain’s cabin. Do I find a treasure map?”\n\nMe: “Actually, you do.”\n\nJizzard: “Kickass.”\n\nThe map had a crude drawing of one of the larger islands that the party could see on the map of the realm. There were two small villages, Gerestyr on the coast, and Vertilund farther inland, near a large mountain marked with an “x”. On the map was written the following:\n\n“ Always smiles (or maybe frowns),\n\nSinks in water, but never drowns,\n\nCatches prey on barbed teeth,\n\nHunts all day, but never eats.”\n\nHonestly, it was pretty entertaining watching the group try to figure out the riddle. After many failed guesses, they realized that the answer was a fishhook.\n\nThe island was fairly close, and the group quickly reached Gerestyr, a small fishing village. They dropped anchor and rowed up to the docks, where they began to look around for clues about fishhooks.\n\nAfter a bit of searching, they found the Rusty Fishhook tavern.\n\nWhisky: “Oh.”\n\nAmanduh: “Wait, is it safe to say that Von Streuben is well known around here?”\n\nMe: “That would be a fair guess.”\n\nAmanduh: “I’m going to try to pass as the captain.”\n\nShe passed a disguise check and swaggered her way into the bar. She didn’t bother covering her face, as her character was pretty butch.\n\nBarmaiden: “Captain! You’re back! Here, have a round of drinks for you and your crew. You deserve it after all the you’ve done for us.”\n\nJizzard: “GODDAMN IT, DID WE JUST KILL ANOTHER GOOD GUY!?”\n\nLankoris: “I don’t care if he’s the Robin Hood of this town or whatever. He attacked us first, so we’re in the right this time.”\n\nAfter Amanduh got directions to the next town and Whisky got very drunk, the party headed out to Vertilund.\n\nVertilund was a very small town nestled in the shadow of a large mountain, which sheltered the town from the large glacial Ice Sheets just behind it. The Ice Sheets were hundreds of feet high, and in most places, completely cut off the far northern continent of Tengalia from the rest of the world (hence why the halflings traveled on flying whales).\n\nWhisky: “What if this is like, a snowboarding town or something.”\n\nI thought that was a pretty good idea. I made a few quick on-the-fly adjustments.\n\nWhisky: “Anyway, we should probably find a trader to get some climbing equipment to get up the mountain.”\n\nMe: “You find the general goods store near the base of the mountain. The shopkeeper’s name is Chad.”\n\nJizzard: “Fucking Chad.”\n\nChad: “What up, dudes? Looking for some gear to head up those gnarly slopes?”\n\nWhisky: “We need climbing gear.”\n\nChad: “If you’re heading up the mountain, you dudes are gonna want some cold weather gear. It’s really cold up there, brah.”\n\nThe party bought all the equipment that Chad recommended and began their ascent. It was a long and arduous climb, but everyone made it. Lankoris spotted a curious-looking crevasse at a point where the glacier met the mountain, and suggested that they check it out.\n\nAs they got closer, they could tell that this was not a natural crack in the ice; it was carved by hand. A steep ramp of ice descended into the darkness. Whisky set his backpack on the ground, stood on top of it, and boarded on it to the bottom, catching a little air on the way down and doing cool tricks.\n\nThe narrow passage widened into a larger room. At the other end was a chest frozen in a large block of ice. Whisky rushed towards it without bothering to check for traps, and snapped a hidden tripwire. A few arrows flew at him from small holes in the wall, striking him for a bit of damage. Then, the cavern began to rumble. With a roar, a large ice golem ripped itself out of the wall and began attacking the party.\n\nThe party beat it into submission, narrowly avoiding the explosion it released when it died. Amanduh began hacking away at the ice on the chest, freeing it after a few tries. Once it was open, the chest contained a good bit of gold and valuable jewels, as well as a mysterious amulet set with gems that formed a crude scorpion.\n\nThe members of the party divided up the loot and travelled back to Gerestyr, where they rowed back out to their ship and continued on their greater quest.\n\nFrom there, shit got very real.",

        "text": "Just a one-off that I thought was funny from the gaming session this weekend:\n\nFirst to describe my character:  he's a Troll Street Samurai.  For those who don't know the universe, Trolls are the biggest, meanest, most physically imposing of the playable character races.  The term \"Street Samurai\" means that he's basically been replacing what few squishy bits of his natural body there were with cybernetic implants, losing touch with what little humanity he had in the first place.\n\nTorr, for that is his name, has a physical strength of 13 with his muscular augmentations, (for reference, the normal human maximum before any modification is 6 - and that's a Strongman competitor), aluminium-laced bones, and a pretty crude sense of humor.  The same muscular augmentations that give him his strength also give him a pretty high agility, so despite his size he's pretty good at not being there when you want to shoot him.\n\nAs part of a job our group has taken, we're to get certain information and samples from a brewery/winery in town.  Doesn't pay to ask who for, so we didn't.  The other members of the party have done all their excellent work, getting fingerprints from the owner and brewmaster...  meanwhile Torr hasn't been able to participate much other than throw in the odd quip or idea.  We finally get to the night where we're going to do the deed.  To make the run a bit more profitable for ourselves, we break in to the \"Special Collections\" area first, and using stolen thumbprints start stealing a lot of expensive bottles of wine to fence later.  We're about 80% done loading up the expensive wine when some of the security guards wander outside and notice Torr, in combat armor with a combat helm and armed to the teeth (Massive troll-sized katana and shotgun strapped to his back) loading a truck.  As you can imagine, they're not thrilled...  Initiative is rolled, Torr bum-rushes one of them and damn near kills him with one punch, while our \"Face\" (the guy who does the talking for our group) kills the other with a single shot from his rifle.  The rigger has one of his flying drones do a quick strafing run on the mook Torr punched to finish him off, and all's quiet.  The enemy was dead before they had a chance to react - rapidly assuming the ambient temperature in less than 3 seconds...  so we finish loading.\n\nThat's not the fun bit.\n\nIt's now about 2 AM - previous recon has told us that this is when most of the guards go to the break room.  The plan is for Torr, 2 Duelist drones (human-form drones with swords for arms), and the Face to go in and cause one hell of a distraction, while the rest of the party finds the stuff we've been contracted to find.\n\nThe troll rushes the door, kicks it twice and in it falls.  Inside are 6 of the security guards, hands on weapons and looking at this 9 foot tall *thing* blocking the damaged door frame, gigantic katana in hand and manic grin on his face.  Torr looks at them and yells \"HELLO BOYS!\" as combat initiates.\n\nTo summarize at least an hour of throwing dice and looking up rules, the six guards end up getting sliced to bits.  The duelist drones do a bit of damage and soak some shots before getting destroyed.  The Face shoots in to the room from around the door-frame and kills one of the targets, then moves in with shock-gloves to take out another one who was severely wounded.  Torr cuts the rest of them to ribbons.  This is where the beauty of Torr comes out:  He's pretty good at dealing damage, with his huge strength and his skill in Blades, but the best part is that he's damn-near impossible to hurt.  Those shots he didn't dodge just bounced off his armor or his tough troll skin (for those interested in the system, 9 Body + 12 armor from combat jacket + 2 armor for combat helmet + 2 armor for Aluminum-laced bones + 1 armor for his Troll skin + 1 armor from the Toughness quality = 27 total dice to roll for damage reduction).  Though he got shot quite a few times, not a single bullet from the guards SMGs managed to find a squishy bit to hurt.\n\n21 seconds of gunfire and screams after Torr broke in to the room, a lone guard, bleeding from several large cuts, runs out of the room.  Torr, covered in blood and viscera, runs up from behind him cuts him down, finishing off the poor terrified man.  Down the hallway, several of his fellow Runners see this.  Torr gestures at himself and says over his internal commlink \"Don't worry, none of it is mine.\"\n\nSo what does a blood-covered troll with next to no connection to humanity do when the immediate slaughter is done and he won't be needed for a little while?\n\nHe lays on the ground and makes [blood-angels.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yEfSin8FoBY/TiwtMWeX6GI/AAAAAAAAB4M/UlnwXZJTp5Q/s1600/snow_angel.jpg)",

        "text": "So way back when, me and a friend would spend every Friday after school LANing AoEII against AI players. We were not the best, but we managed to get good enough so we could hold our own against two Insane AI's. We also only played Regicide, so that we would never get bogged down trying to run down that one last annoying villager.\n\nFor the match in question, we were doing Team Islands, with me as Japan, (for the extra sight on Galley's) and my friend as France, I think so he could have the awesome Paladins, against two AIs. Our plan was to have me mass ships to burst a hole through to the enemies' island, where our transports would dump loads of Samurai, Paladins and Trebs, who would then all rush the closest enemy King and then kill him. The survivors would then get back onto their transports, rush back to our bases to get healed up by monks and get reinforcements, then repeat with the other King. As you can imagine, this plan lasted all of 20 minutes before we were forced to change things a bit.\n\nIt all started with my first dock being destroyed before I could get a good fleet built up. Alright, not a big deal, if they dumped all their resources into ships than they had none for actual troops, so I wouldn't be invaded, unless of course one built the warships, and the other built the troops. But what were the odds of that? Fast forward another 15 minutes, and my main base has been destroyed, with only a castle pumping out troops with what resources I got, and a small secondary base built on the center of the island I shared with my ally. The force that destroyed my base were mostly killed in the struggle, with what remained just kinda idling around trying to root out my remnants. My ally was facing his own invasion, and was losing troops fast, but not as fast as his invaders.\n\nWhat followed was several hours of us destroying invading armies, rebuilding our economies, and being forced to the center of the island. At the end of it all, we were out of resources; our main method was using trading ships from docks right next to each other to get 1 gold, which would build up over time until we could get what we needed from markets. (We used trading boats because in case of an attack, they could sail off and be safer than trading carts). We sunk what we had into a desperation army, made up of skirmishers, Pikemen, a few dozen Samurai and a few very precious Trebs. We left nothing behind on our island; if this failed, we failed and would shortly die. Our kings huddled together in the same Castle, just inland far enough that no Cannon Galleons could get it at it, and surrounded by a maze of Palisades and Guard Towers so the AI would be forced to walk their way through (We had discovered the AI would always walk past walls instead of destroying them if there was an opening they could see, so thus a maze would give time for anything ranged to pick them off).\n\nWe set off with our forces, flanked by what navy I could set up. Our most important troops, namely the Trebs and the Samurai, were in the center of the convoy, while the outside was fast fire ships and the Pikeman/Skirmisher distractions. The spearhead was Demolition Ships for opening up a quick hole to land the troops; there would be no going back. We had to get both Kings in one go, with limited troops and no way to replenish them. It was a suicide charge to go down in history, except no one would survive to tell the story.\n\nThe first landing goes without a hitch, somehow. We ran into no enemy vessels on the way over, and we even found a relatively clear beach to land on. We wasted no time getting everyone off and streaming to the nearest castle. We had the element of surprise, we were not going to waste it. We ordered the Trebs (controlled by my ally) and the Samurai (obviously controlled by me) straight for the castle that held the first King, don't pass go, don't collect 200 gold, while the rabble of other troops were tasked with throwing themselves on whatever got in the way, to buy us those few precious seconds. My navy was keeping pace off shore, destroying everything they could to keep them from harassing our invaders. Even my transports were helping, by running into sight range of anything and drawing aggro. We get to the first Castle, we get the Trebs set up and my Samurai wailing away on it. It looks kinda dicey, as a sizable force makes their way towards my allies Trebs, but they got caught up on a house and so some of my Suicide Pikeman manage to hold them off. We also got super lucky, as it was actually my Samurai that destroyed the Castle, so the big chunk of rock hurled by a Treb ended up hitting the King (VERY lucky shot) and just like that, one player is eliminated, meaning all his troops stop fighting. But this still leaves the other player, and HIS King is not nearby. We could fight our way across the island, losing forces to attrition along the way, or we could take option B.\n\nSee, none of our plans ever actually worked. We thought we would be forced to sacrifice our navies, but to our surprise they were mainly intact! We lost our Demolition Ships when the rammed a few Cannon Galleons, but most of our other ships were fine, INCLUDING our transports, were fine. It was getting late, we had been playing for almost 5 hours at this point, and so we decided to just put it all on black: Load up what we had left, and land our troops right in the enemy base. yes, we would be taking loses constantly, and yes, that meant any troops he made would be right there, but they had to kill everyone, while we had to just kill an old man in a giant stone house.\n\nThis landing went far less smoothly. We lost a transport before we even got close (it only had a few troops that couldn't fit in the others luckily). When we did land, it was just a cluster of various units attacking each other, slooooowly carving a swathe through the base until we reached the target: The Castle. There was no self preservation this time, it was just everyone hitting the castle as hard and often as they could, whittling it down, lower and lower. The Trebs were destroyed almost immediately, but they got a few rocks off. Soon, all that was left was just a few Samurai, a hand-full of Pikemen, and a couple of Skirmishers, but the Castle finally fell, and the King was in the open! And then he ran into a Guard Tower! We didn't care where he went though, we would just keep destroying building until he had nowhere else to run! Once again, everyone was wailing on the tower, until it, too, fell. Except this time, the King had nowhere to run. He was surrounded, and he fell to a flurry of pikes and Katana's and those wierd javelin things the Skirmishers use. Both kings were dead. We had finally, FINALLY won!\n\nWe checked the map once we were done, and there was no fog of war, and we realized that the first played must have just landed an invasion force as we had started our own attacks. That was why we had such an easy time at first! Gad we attacked just a moment too soon, we would have had to deal with that force, and we would have been wiped out. If we had attacked any later, than we would have had that invasion to contend with, and we would have been wiped out. It was just sheer dumb luck, plain and simple.\n\nWe still talk about that game to this day, my friend and I. We always refer to it as Port Jolom, as I had built the first castle and dock there as a way to defend our Trade Caravans. We have tried to accomplish the same intensity, the same sheer insanity of that match, but we have never been able to meet it. We moved on in our lives, to other games and other adventures, but I think that will always be my favorite match of any RTS I have ever played.\n",

She's also somewhat of a mechanic, and can do a ton of handy work as well, which will come in handy.\n\nNow, the rest of the party members are Collector Demons, which means they are a living cage for souls they steal from mortals (They still look human), and the supernatural and bring them to \"Sheddim\", which is the realm of the Demons. The other members of the group rejected this fate, and became renegade demons. The Demon party members are...\n\n\"J\" - The big strong one of the group. He's been a collector for a while, and he has burn marks all over his face. He's probably the most dangerous one of the group, as he has by far the most strength, dexterity and constitution. But is mental scores are \"lacking\" to say the least, as he completely forgot his name, except for the 1st letter. He's been around since the 1940's, and thus hes basically a mobster.\nHe is the most likely to betray, because he's almost a ravenous monster. But he is the least likely since he's \"special\". And my god he is a badass.\n\nRavion - The hot shot. He's in a cowboy hat, with a duster coat. We established that before this, I (Delilah) was hunting him, but this devilishly charming (pun intended) man connived me to spare him, after Siracco saved him. Im still keeping eyes on him though, since he was on \"the list\" not to long ago. He constantly makes sexual innuendo to boot. He also decribed himself as \"Dean\" from the show \"Supernatural\". He wears a cowboy hat, and a duster coat.\n\nAnd lastly, Siracco - He's probably the most relaxed and average of the group. He's almost like a teenager of sorts, and carries bags and pocket loads of items and things he finds interesting, or helpful. He was say me confront Ravion, and threw himself between me and him. I have a code of conduct where I can't harm any bystanders, and thus I spared him in order to protect Siracco from collateral damage. He's also a bloody genius. But he's weak and scrawny as hell, but he has his Command (Charisma) and Intuition (Wisdom) scores near maxed out. He is the most likely to save us, purely from knowledge rolls and diplomacy.\n\nThe first session is pretty soon, and Ill have a write up on it as soon as its done. Let me know if this is something you guys would be interested in.\n\nEdit - *finally* made a write up on session 1, and excited for session two. Ill write session 2 much sooner, and with more detail. And Ill probably edit this way more, to get the characters descriptions right.\n\nChapter one can be viewed [here](http://en.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2cbiok/worlds_of_shadow_and_flesh_prologuechapter_1/)",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2bow9k/dd_35_woody_stump_the_pixie_rangerdruid_and_the/",
        "text": "Background Knowledge: The adventure that I created Woody Stump for was a D&amp;D campaign set in the Lord of the Rings (LotR) universe. I will let those reading know now that I'm not big on Tolkien lore; I haven't read the books, so I won't act like I know what age we were playing in. The DM at the time told me to think of it as during the time a prequel could be happening before the LotR movies. Mordor, Sauron, and Saruman are essentially just starting to gain power.\n\nBefore creating Woody, I had a Sorcerer that was dear to me fight, and die at the hands of the Witch King. So, this Woody character was supposed to be more for fun after having my main character killed trying to save Middle Earth. Woody Stump referring to Forrest Gump. A pixie just to be a little prick. Those kinds of things.\n\nThe main reason for this game tale though is because I did something in this game that I had never really done before; completely derail the main story line. My character was getting into trouble with a lot of the party, mostly because he was a little prick that wasn't good at taking a back seat. He wanted to lead, take charge, and he didn't always get his way. After all the struggles with the party and a fight that resulted in my character's kidnapping, I felt like I was pretty much free to do whatever I wanted. So, my character with the knowledge that Saruman was starting to take down trees at Isengard, decided that he wasn't going to stand for the encroachment on nature, and he would do something about it.\n\nThe main story line that we were on had a lot to do with diplomacy, and earning the favor of the Dwarves and Elves to come together under one common enemy, Sauron. My character decided that since I was concerned about nature, I would go to the Elves first. On the way there, my character comes into contact with Radagast the Brown. At the time, I didn't know who he was, because like I said, I haven't read the books. He ends up saving me while I'm on my way to meet the Elves. This is when my character starts to make the shift from Ranger to Druid. He takes me under his wing, shows me spells, while traveling to Mirkwood. (These were the closest Elves to where I was captured.) After meeting with the Elves there (and some great rolls on my Diplomacy checks, my DM told me they were probably not going to take me seriously, but my rolls were consistently in the high teens), they agree to help, but only if they know they can count on more numbers from other allies.\n\nAs a Ranger/Druid, I turned to Radagast and asked if he knew of any allies of nature. The Ents were brought up, and from that point forward, that was all I cared about. I was going to get the Ents to attack Isengard. I thought it would be so cool to basically rewrite the history of the movies by having this attack happen years before it's time.\n\nI told Radagast that I would appreciate if he followed me on the journey, but I think my DM was starting to get impatient with me and this side quest that I was going to venture out on that Radagast basically told me, you've gotta do this on your own, but if you need me, I'll be there and then rides off. So I decide, fuck it, I'm going to do it, I don't even care if it gets me killed.\n\nNow, for those that don't know D&amp;D, pixies have A LOT of OP powers in the 3.5 era. Things like invisibility, flight, sleeping arrows, and their stats were ridiculous too. Just with the invisibility and flight, I was able to out maneuver most of the baddies that my DM threw my way. Some challenges I accepted, others, I would just sneak around as best as possible. They are also \"Tiny\" creatures, which means they're just hard to pick out anyway. Natural pluses to Hide checks and such.\n\nSo eventually, I get to the Ents, at long last. I remember feeling so excited at the table, knowing that I had finally made it! The Ents were one of my favorite parts of the movies too. So I meet Treebeard, and my DM talks in the slow, low, lumbering voice, and everything takes forever to get done. Most of that session was spent trying to get them to even have the \"tribunal\" kind of thing they do. Where they all meet to discuss what actions to take. Basically I was Merry and Pippen at this point. Just telling him that trees are being destroyed. I basically gave them the Lorax speech. I speak for the trees, and if you won't help, who will?\n\nAfter essentially two sessions of speaking with Treebeard and the other Ents over and over, I convince them to take action. They begin their march to Isengard, I'm delighted. I've actually leveled up pretty well now at this point. All the threats thrown at me to the elves, then to the ents all by myself. A lot of experience points to soak in. I send an animal messenger to find Radagast, and let him know that I need to get back to the Elves to tell them that the Ents are on their way to meet up and destroy Isengard. My DM, at this point just like, no there's no way this will happen rolls some percentage die with what he says is a 10 percent chance of him being able to help me out. Rolls it, and he face-palms. Of course Radagast can help.\n\nHe sends one giant Eagle for me, which please just enjoy the image of a Tiny pixie the size of a house cat essentially, on an eagle as large as in the movies. It arrives at Mirkwood, I inform the Elves that the Ents march to Isengard, and the Elves, impressed, ready their armies for march the next day.\n\nAnd that's how I got to destroy Isengard all by myself, and in our LotR lore for future campaigns, Woody Stump has taken over the role of Radagast the Brown as essentially a world watcher for nature. My friends were vexed by the amount of time that I was away from the party, but they enjoyed it when I met up with them again and was bearing the news that Isengard had been overthrown, and the Ents were inhabiting the space now. I then had the Ents and Elves of Mirkwood join the armies of the Dwarves that they had been working to get favor from for our final battle. I've never played on my own in a party like that since then, but I always thought that it made for one of the better stories that we've had in a campaign, and completely set off the course of the \"history\" of that world forever.\n\n*Edited for accuracy",

        "text": "A bit of background on the party.\n\nCodrus the minotaur warden - my character, a lighting pole-arm specialists, strong of will and muscle but not so much a people person and certainly not very bright. \n\nAllouete - Our pyro elf wizard.  Smart and speaks well but loves to watch the world burn while making detailed notes the whole time. \n\nKento - Our shapeshifting druid - One of those hard to pronounce races whos goal was to gather unique animals to repopulate his home island.  \n\nPeck - The Stealthy mushroom-man rogue - comes in a bit later in the story.\n\n\nWe had been playing for a while up to this point but the first relevant part of this story comes after we had rowed a small raft down a river and along the coast as we were trying to make contact with a wise man that would have taken weeks to travel to on land. As we start pulling in towards shore for the night we notice a dozen or so figures standing on the water ahead of us. As we approach their leader announces himself as a pirate lord and he has been hired to kill us by the big bad of the story. \n\nTurns out they were actually standing on a giant crab and were armed with powerful ranged hand cannons and clearly had the upper hand. Codrus sees they don't have a ship the scene proceeds as so.\n\nCodrus \"If you pirate lord where be your ship?\"\nPirate \"Its off on an important mission for our patron Mr. BBEG. Anyway I don't need my full force to deal with the likes of your group.\"\nA PC paladin who left the game shortly \"Alright then why don't we head to shore and handle this like real men.\"\nPirate \"Ha a true pirate never leaves the sea.\"\n\nCodrus gets the idea that if he can be the last one in the water he can become a pirate lord. Fight is just about to start when our druid is talking to the giant crab and convinces it that it would be a much better idea to join with us and live on his island than work for the pirates and crits on his nature roll. The Crab agrees and sinks down into the water ruining the pirates powdered weapons leaving them to swim for shore or be taken out by our mages magic missiles. Push comes to shove and we summerly take out the pirates with Codrus dealing the final blow to the pirate captain with a critical hit that severs his head from his body and ends with the hat flipping ceremoniously onto one of Codrus's horns.\n\nCodrus \"Hey look you call Codrus Captain Codrus now\" to the rest of the group.  \n\nA short while later we come across a town beset by pirates. Turns out these are the same crew of pirates we had killed the leader of and they had what Codrus thought to be his ship. Turns out with the death of the pirate lord the ship had been cursed cursed by a priestess of the BBEG and the pirates had been trapped in this town for weeks now. \n\nAfter a confusing conversation with the pirates they agree to leave the town if we can help them reclaim their ship, likely planning to backstab us ones the ship is clear. We eagerly agree. \n\nGetting onto the ship was rather easy with Codrus quickly throwing our elf mage onto the ship to ensure no backing out. Navigating the ship was rather easy but the curse took the form of many transformation traps.  First our elf mage was transformed into a drow which upset her greatly. The druid was mostly unaffected by the traps as he could easily change to whatever form he liked best. \n\nCodrus however was not quite so lucky he triggered 2 traps. The First was quite early on the ship which transformed Codrus into a minotaur sized chicken. The second was right before we reached the room with the priestess which changed him back into himself without his horns. A short fight later with a dead priestess everything when back to normal and the mage came up to Codrus to ask about what it felt like to be a chicken. \nCodrus replied \"It was confusing and sad, only safe breakfast foods are pancakes and bacon.\" \nHowever the ship was now ours even with a rather untrustworthy crew, and a new mushroom man character in the treasure hold.\n\nAfter a few more adventures we learn of a meeting of the pirate lords and promptly decide to attend, even though they were all working for the BBEG. \n\nNow our GM had planned on the pirates being dissatisfied with working for BBEG and joining forces with us to take the BBEG down. We had other plans. You see pirate ships are usually full of treasure. We liked treasure. We had a plan to take them down.\n\nTwo of our characters knew how to cast the walk on water ritual and my character knew the summon winds ritual. We also had casks of black powder and a potion of invisibility.   The meeting was to take place with the 5 pirate lords ships all bow to bow in a circle so they could each talk to each other from their own ship. As the ships were all pulling together team sneaky bombs begins casting water walk to be ready once the talking begins. \n\nCodrus's poor charisma scores actually work to the advantage here by causing the pirates to all start arguing not noticing team sneaky bombs planting explosives on their ships. Eventually it comes down to the vote where the GM expects us to change plans and side with the pirates against the BBEG. \n\nUnfortunately its at this point where our rogue rolls a 1 on his stealth and gets noticed. Codrus sees this and its his turn to vote and I had just finished casting Summon Winds. \n\nCodrus says \" Codrus have new idea. With no more pirates, Codrus become Pirate King.\" \nAnd i signal our gunners to shoot the explosives and create a vortex with the wind to fuel the flames. \n\nThings go almost to well at this point. The Pirates shots mostly miss our ship and we manage to get all our explosives to go off. I use the summoned winds to cause the other ships to all ram into each other and our mage casts summon magma beast on the least damaged ship. \n\nThe GM just narrates the rest of the fight as he throws away pages of material he had prepared. \n\nWe rescue the only survivor and set our giant crab to gather the riches from the sunken ships. \n\nCodrus turns to the survivor and says to him \n\"Welcome to Pirate King Ship. You part of crew now, you write song of this day. No share for you until song is done.\" and walks away. \n\nThe pirate is in shock and weakly whimpers \"But I don't know how to write...\" ",

        "text": "My players are currently exploring a world wrecked by a species of highly mutative dragons known as Draques. In tonight's session, the group was traveling through a swamp looking for some Half-Orcs to talk to and/or murder. While traveling back, the group encountered a pool of water that writhed out and towards them, itself actually a giant ooze. Trying to see what happened, they took a look closer, making a Perception check.\n\nNow, in preparation for my game I created what I call the Die of Doom; basically a massive randomized critical fail table. I also decided to create a critical success version of the table, deemed the Die of Destiny. Anything from an attack roll to a saving throw to a skill check can activate the Die of Doom/Destiny, and that is exactly what happened on the Perception check. \n\nMy player got a critical success on his Perception check and managed to roll my favorite randomization: \"Manage to complete a magical ritual which has laid latent for some time; roll on the Rod of Malicious Wonder.\"\n\nThe Rod of Malicious Wonder is another of my creations, which is exactly as it sounds, an expanded version of the Rod of Wonder, but with a slew of nasty and bizarre effects. In this case, he rolled bizarre.\n\nThe Dwarven Aegis forms an ectoplasmic armor around himself, he turns to look at the massive ooze filled with crystals, grabs his axe... and suddenly his pants begin to rustle. He looks down, confused, as a small furry head pokes out, eyes wide in fright. The rabbit wriggles, clawing and scratching his way out. Then, another head pops out of his pant leg. He kicks it out. He feels more feet scurry around his legs, but before he can even try to get them out hundreds of rabbits begin appearing and tearing out of his pants openings.\n\nThe rest of the party looks to the Dwarf, confused, but are nearly bowed over by the rabbits flooding out of the pants. In fact, the ooze becomes second in everyone's mind, because the rabbits are running over everything. \n\nAnother player notices that the rabbits who look at the ooze are starting to become stone. Telling everyone to look away, the Gnome has another realization. These are bunnies! Hundreds of scared, confused bunnies! She does the only logical thing in this situation: she casts Speak With Animals on herself and screams \"RUN! RUN FOR THE OOZE IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!\"\n\nOf course, she gets a natural 20 on the Intimidate check, and coincidentally rolls the \"Your opponents are frightened of you for 24 hours.\" The rabbits, now confused, scared, and almost literally dying of fear from the screaming Gnome wrapped in a giant serpent, do the only thing they can think of: they charge the ooze. \n\nSo, now there are several hundred rabbits charging a giant ooze, a Dwarf struggling desperately to deal with the many rabbits emerging from his pants, a Gnome cackling madly, casting Prestidigitation on whatever rabbit comes close enough so as to change them random colors, while also waving her arms to direct the rabbits to the ooze, a Half-Orc standing and watching the scene play out in confusion, another Half-Orc (wearing a luchadore outfit, just to complete the picture) also staring in confusion, and a Halfling hobo, sighing as he rips off part of his rags and ties it around his eyes. The DMPC Bard puts his guitar away and instead begins writing down everything that is happening.\n\nAs the rabbits continue to flood out, the Gnome allows her serpent to slide down and eat some rabbits. The Dwarf raises his leg, spewing the rabbits forward. The luchadore, wanting something to do but afraid to touch the ooze, grabs two rabbits off the ground, wielding them like bunny-chuks, and lobs one at the ooze. It flies straight, screeching through the air, and lands head first in the ooze, scratching and tearing at the ooze as it tries to break out. The other Half-Orc stands still and contemplates what he's doing with his life. The Halfling fishes an alchemist fire from his bag, takes aim at the ooze, and lets rip! \n\nAnd hits nothing but bunny! They screech in pain as the fire engulfs them. The Gnome frowns. The Half-Orc smirks. The Dwarf shakes more rabbits out. The Luchadore thinks this is a great idea and throws a flask of acid at the ooze, but he actually looks and hits it.\n\nThe ooze, now filled to the brim with rabbits and partially stone rabbits, tries to move away. The party all realize that the ooze is trying to escape, so they surround it, moving through the crowd of bunnies. \n\nThe Half-Orc stabs the ooze with his halberd, but it keeps moving. The Halfling punches it, but it fails to strike. The Gnome stands powerfully in its path, like the Tank Man. The Dwarf hops awkwardly through the rabbit horde, holding one leg up to let the rabbits spew forth. The Luchadore thinks it's still too dangerous to touch the ooze, so he picks up the biggest rabbit he can find, a massive flemish hare, and swings it at the ooze, but not before whispering softly in its ear, \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\nThe flemish hare strikes the ooze and sends ripples chaotically moving through it. The bottom of the membrane tears, and all its innards pour forth. The flemish hare bounces back, bruised but alive. The rest of the party stares in confusion. The Luchadore decided the flemish hare was now his pet. The Bard writes furiously.\n\nAnd that was how my party killed a giant ooze with a flemish hare.\n\nAs a fun epilogue, the Halfling had an idea as he was catching rabbits after the ooze was killed. He borrowed a magical comb from the Gnome. The comb allowed the Gnome to style her hair into whatever fashion she wanted instantly, but only so long as it was physically possible and she had the materials on hand to do so. She had gathered a whole bunch of dye and jewels and other accoutrements to fix her hair up all sorts of ways. The Halfling just held a bunch of rabbits. As he swiped the comb through his hair, the rabbits writhed suddenly, then their organs, bones, muscles and viscera spilled forth from their anuses, and their skins wrapped up into his hair, forming giant rabbit-pelt dredlocks. Everyone else looked on in horror. The Bard wrote.\n\nEDIT: Due to popular request, here are the random tables used. \n\n[Die of Doom](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12bBFiRLkIKskFu2gbWvd_GDfp6GdK1vLInEyemMl7tA/edit)\n\n[Die of Destiny](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBftzBS0inxtQ9c-441s84st2Z7AyGwbLuSRyYGDf7Q/edit)\n\n[Rod of Malicious Wonder](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Of8OCRBEG6pSt0eGcxV4Wi37CpUWjOD0aWeuhUHvNQ/edit)\n\nAnd to my players who are monitoring this thread, know that I've changed the order of all of the effects so you can't cheat on the Die of Doom/Destiny.",

At long last, they reached the gates of Frostholm, capital of the Abjod and seat of King Erik. It was a very norse-inspired city. The best description I can convey for the overall feel of the place  would be kind of like Windhelm from Skyrim, but with more timber accents.\n\nLankoris: “Okay, you know what? Let’s find that merchant we ran into on the road and exact a little revenge for those two guys we killed. It’s the least we could do.”\n\nWhisky: “I need a drink first.”\n\nThe party found their way to the slightly seedy Dockside district, which was, of course, near the docks that took in merchant vessels from all over to load or unload goods. With a little asking around, Whisky was able to find the Whore’s Nipple tavern, where the ale was cheap but there was a lot of it. Whisky ordered copious amounts of ale and asked about any elves in the city.\n\nBarkeep: “Well, I did see a snake-oil salesman or somesuch hawking his crap down by the docks. Fellow gave me a bad feeling.”\n\nLankoris: “I’ll take care of him. You guys go talk to the king. Here, maybe this breastplate will help.”\n\nLankoris pulled up his cowl and slunk into a back alley, where he began climbing up onto the roof of one of the buildings. Everyone else went up to the classier part of town to meet with King Erik. They entered his hall and approached him. King Erik sat upon his throne, wearing a bearskin cloak. He was middle-aged, but obviously still strong and fit for battle. A steel crown rested upon his flowing blond locks, and he had an immaculately trimmed goatee.\n\nWhisky: “Your Majesty, we have dire news of stuff going on in your kingdom.”\n\nKing Erik: “And who are you?”\n\nWhisky: “ I am known as Whisky, and these are my companions, Amanduh and The Jizzard. We’re, ah, contractors for the Order of Retribution.”\n\nKing Erik: “Oh, good. How’s Ragnar doing? I haven’t spoken with him in some time.”\n\nWhisky: “He’s fine. Anyway, I have evidence that someone is using necromancy around here.”\n\nKing Erik: “That’s terrible news. Guards, show these people to Kelir. He’ll know more about this than me.”\n\nThe guards escorted the group to another chamber that was full of old books and other ancient things. A very old man with a bald head and a Monopoly-Man-esque moustache greeted them.\n\nKelir: “Hello, travelers, I am Kelir, the kingdom’s historian. What can I do for you?”\n\nWhisky: “We found some undead down in Bjorngard. One of them was wearing this.”\n\nWhisky handed Kelir the breastplate taken from the skeleton. He looked puzzled as he turned it over in his wrinkled old hands.\n\nKelir: “Wait, I… I think I’ve heard a description of this object before. One moment.”\n\nKelir searched through his shelves and stacks of books until he found the thick old tome he was looking for. He blew some dust off of the cover and began thumbing through it.\n\nKelir: “Ah! I knew it! This is a piece of the armor of Ongvar the Hero!”\n\nJizzard: “Who the what?”\n\nKelir: “You know, the one in the stories from the Great War.”\n\nWhisky: “Forgive us, my friends and I aren’t exactly from around here. Would you mind refreshing us?”\n\nKelir: “Well, about 250 years ago, the entire land was in upheaval. The armies of the Human, Elven, and Dwarven kingdoms fought a bloody war for control over the island that holds what is now known as Asgaron. See, it was rumored that an object of great power lay hidden there. It was a brutal stalemate with heavy losses on all sides, until Ongvar showed up. He led the Abjod’s armies on a string of major victories, and had the Knights not formed, it’s reasonable to assume that he would have conquered the entire continent.”\n\nJizzard: “What was that about the Knights?”\n\nKelir: “The Knights of Retribution was created during the war. No one really knows who the first Knights were, but they were damn good fighters, and even better diplomats. They brokered peace between the three armies, and founded Asgaron as a common ground for all races.”\n\nAmanduh: “And what happened to that powerful thing?”\n\nKelir: “The Knights scoured the island from top to bottom, but whatever it was, it was never found. After the war, Ongvar became a thrill-seeking adventurer and did many things worthy of legend, most notably, driving dragons into extinction. Later, he surprisingly died of old age.”\n\nWhisky: “Where was he buried?”\n\nKelir: “Ongvar’s body was taken to his hometown of Horvik Bay, where he was entombed in the nearby mountains near the other not-so-fortunate war heroes. By the way, I would pay you handsomely for that breastplate. I collect old things like that, and it would be a fine addition to my collection.”\n\nKelir traded the party a substantial amount of gold for the armor, and the group took their leave and went back to the Whore’s Nipple, but not before Amanduh took a side trip to a nearby brothel and purchased an escort.\n\nNight had begun to fall, and that was when Lankoris made his move. He climbed down off of the roof and into the back of the merchant’s covered cart, where the elf was sleeping. Lankoris gagged him, then tied his hands together. He dragged the squirming elf down the street to the docks by the ankle, then began dunking him in the frigid water, pulling him up for an occasional gasp of air before plunging him back down again.\n\nAt about this time, everyone else realized that they hadn’t seen Lankoris in a while and went down to the docks to find him. Whisky managed to convince him to stop dunking the merchant, punched said merchant a few times, and then threw him over his shoulder and hauled him to the jail, hoping to get a cash reward that he could buy more booze with.\n\nThe party walked into the jail to see a stocky dwarf with black hair sitting with his feet kicked up on a wooden table.\n\nJailer: “Th’ bloody hell do ye want?”\n\nWhisky: “This dude was selling poison to people disguised as healing potions.”\n\nJailer: “D’ ye have any proof o’ that? We can’t jus’ go around imprisonin’ random elves.”\n\nLankoris: “Well, I did take one of the potions from his cart. Care for a taste of your own medicine? If it’s not poison, surely you would be fine with it.”\n\nThe elf began sweating and took a quick glance at the prison cells behind the jailer. Without a word, he snatched to potion from Lankoris, downed it in one gulp. He smiled and began foaming at the mouth. The elf fell to the ground and began convulsing while extending both of his middle fingers at the party. Amanduh’s whore shrieked and ran out the door.\n\nJailer: “Well, looks like my work ‘ere is done.”\n\nThe party went back to the Whore’s Nipple once more and bought rooms for the night. I can’t believe I forgot to mention this until now, but every time that the group bought rooms, the Jizzard just shared a room with Amanduh and would snuggle up next to her on the bed.\n\nIn the morning, the party began looking to secure passage to Horvik Bay. They asked several ship captains who were hanging around near the docks if there was anyone heading there. A rather salty looking fellow with friendly muttonchops and a bandanna tied around his head approached them and introduced himself as Captain Frodnar Stormrunner.\n\nFrodnar: “I couldn’t help but overhear that you folks are looking for passage to Horvik Bay. As it so happens, I’m heading that way, and I’d be much obliged to take you there for a few pieces of silver. We leave in an hour.”\n\nThe party paid him and he led them down the docks to his ship. It was a single-masted viking longship-style craft.\n\nFrodnar: “There she is, the *Manowar*. She might not look like much, but she got it where it counts, kid.”\n\nThe Jizzard rolled his eyes.\n\nThe party boarded the *Manowar*, and with a majestic Hans Zimmer soundtrack playing in the background, they set sail for Horvik Bay.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2bbj1e/dread_my_friend_becomes_an_iphone_and_the_satan/",
        "text": "This happened a while back, so some of the details may be a little vague at times, apologies for that.\n\nBack in May, my sister was visiting from grad school, and I had asked her to run a one shot for me and two of my friends while she was around. Originally, we had planned to just do a Pathfinder campaign I was running, and have her help out, but too many people couldn't make it, so she decided to repurpose a World of Darkness campaign she ran on Halloween and use the Dread system.\n\nFor those of you who don't know what Dread is, it's a tabletop system that replaces the use of dice with the use of a Jenga tower. A successful pull is a success, a failed pull is the death/possession/some other horrifying thing of your character.\n\nWe'd used a random name generator for our characters, so our group ended up being named Ulysses (me), Sigmund (who we just called Siggy), and then, after some absolutely horrible name, my third friend chose to use the name Ron instead of the randomly generated one. We had last names, but I can't be bothered to remember them.\n\nAnyway, the story was that we were all students at Sleepy Hill high school, and we were going to one of those shitty Halloween dances that schools throw. Ron had been commissioned by the school for decorations, one such piece being a gigantic beating human heart that doubled as a punch fountain, which was hanging from the ceiling of the gym and pouring punch down into a large bowl. Siggy was only there because Ron had forced him to go, since he didn't want to be stuck there alone, and I was only there to completely wreck the party for everyone.\n\nAll of a sudden, the lights went out and the noise of the party disappeared. We made our way over to a bucket of glow sticks and started grabbing them. Me and Ron grabbed a couple, then Siggy took everything that was remaining and strapped them all over his body.\n\nNext we made our way to the gym closet. We started rooting through it for weapons and armor. \n\nI ended up with football padding and one of those metal frame masks they make the goaly wear when you're playing floor hockey, as well as a baseball bat and a bow from the archery club. Ron just grabbed a hockey stick, and Siggy grabbed a barbell from a bench press and took of the weights on one side to use as a hammer.\n\nSo, while we were searching around for weapons, long, pale arms started reaching out of the reflective windows at us, never seeming to stop, every once in a while a new joint coming into view.\n\nI hit the arms with my baseball bat and broke one of them, and some kind of acid blood fell to the ground.\n\nThey kept coming.\n\nThat's when Siggy had the bright idea to smash the window, stopping any more from coming at us. Ron picked up a bunch of glass shards and tucked them into the wrapping of his hockey stick.\n\nThen we started hearing a voice, which sounded like a girl crying for help (we all thought this was a trap, but we went with it). We went out into the hallway, and we heard some kind of scraping along the lockers. We made a bit of a mad dash to the girls' locker room, since that's where we heard the noise coming from.\n\nWe found a girl, wearing a school uniform from what looked like the 70s or 80s, and she kept talking about something that was coming for her, then disappeared when we told her what year it was.\n\nAfter that, we rushed out and decided to make a break for the faculty offices, thinking we might be able to find some records of what was going on. We managed to get into the principle's office, and we started hearing the thing talking to us. We kind of assumed this was something satanic at this point, and this voice talking through the speakers only seemed to confirm that.\n\nThe voice kept asking us to let it in, and, being incredibly stupid, I took it literally and started barricading the door. While I was busy being stupid, Siggy went over to open the filing cabinets.\n\nMy sister made him pull for it. He failed.\n\nIt opened, and papers flew out, covering his body and decapitating him (Ron's worst fear being decapitation, so it freaked him the hell out). However, apparantly he wasn't fully dead. He began speaking out of the speakers and giving us help by finding out more about this thing, but if he spent too long, he'd become absorbed.\n\nRon and I started working to undo my barricade, then ran for the library, hoping to find some old newspaper articles about disappearances. We came across one of those tourist books about weird stuff that happens in a town, and managed to find out that people kept disappearing on Halloween every ten years, starting in the 70s or 80s, when the new principle took charge.\n\nNext off, we had decided that it had something to do with the heart-shaped punch fountain Ron had made, so we started moving up to the second floor, where there were windows overlooking the gym. On the way, tiles began to fall out of the floor, and we had to make pulls to get across.\n\nLuckily, Ron and I made it, and we still had Siggy gathering more information about this thing. We got up to the second floor just as the first floor was absorbed into darkness, and began heading to the art room to see if we could find something that might give us more of a clue as to what this thing was, since that was where the heart had been built. Along the way, I moved to one of the windows and smashed it out with my hockey stick, then took a shot with one of mh blunted arrows, hitting the heart and doing some damage to the creature, though Siggy ended up feeling it as well, since he was being absorbed.\n\nLuckily for him (and unluckily for us), an arrow wasn't enough. We needed something more powerful. And so, we ran to the art room and started searching. The materials Ron had used were mostly normal, papier mache stuff, and we saw this huge art project another kid had been working on. One that involved fire.\n\nI grabbed a few rags and wrapped them around some of my arrows, then lit them up at the project, and we rushed back to the broken window. Then we thought of something: Siggy was still in there! We had to think of a way to get him out... Maybe put him in something else.\n\nSo then Ron got the bright idea to put him in a smart phone. We made a pull for it (normally would have needed more, but it was a one-shot campaign, so my sister was more lenient), and we got him in. I made a pull for the shot...\n\nAnd it hit! The heart flared up and burnt to ashes, and at the same time, transported us back to the normal high school, standing up at the window, everyone staring at us, and we had just wrecked the party.\n\nI had accomplished my goal for the night.",

        "text": "A group of my friends and I, 3 players and 1 DM, play D&amp;D regularly, and recently decided to take a break from our normal campaign to try out a hellishly hard campaign called Tomb of Horrors. We made up characters specially to play this as death is guaranteed. Each of us made 3 characters before starting so that we could keep playing after deaths.\n\n\nI'm going to attempt to recount the adventures we had playing a 4e update to this classic challenge.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA call for adventurers willing to brave the tomb of Acererak was sent out by a group of wizards. Three naive souls answered the call.\nA Tiefling Warlock called Agony, holding great disdain for the rest of the group, he looks forward to watching the group die around him.\nA Goliath Hybrid called Vaunea, looking forward to the challenge.\nLastly, a Bunny Ardent called Kris Keira, out for treasure.\n\nThe wizards handed us basic communications crystals and led us to the entrance, parting with a warning that the path was unknown, but deadly, and nothing we encountered would be as mundane as it may appear.\n\nAs we stepped forwards lighting our sunrods it was clear a rift existed between the party. Vaunea and Kris were willing to work together while Agony kept back dawdling with an arrogant sneer towards his companions.\n\nWhile trying to appear unconcerned Agony's slow pace was a deliberate ploy to conceal his constant checking of the floor and walls of the corridoor they found themselves in. \n\nThe corridoor was narrow with many murals on the wall, and a mosaic of tiles on the floor forming a winding red path that led down deeper into the tomb.\n\nImmediately the group came across a chest placed on a high shelf next of a painting of a demon reaching out of a doorway. Kris approached first, but with caution with Vaunea close behind, while Agony stayed away, convinced nothing good could come of a chest so early into the tomb.\n\nVaunea immediately starting coming up with various ways to move and/or open the chest without touching it, suggesting various uses of the ropes from her climbing kit. In the end they agreed to simply attempt to open it standing as far back as they could. Nothing happened so Vaunea stepped forward to examine the contents of the box. Finding it empty she moved away, only for the floor to suddenly collapse beneath her. A lucky saving throw and her acrobatics enabled her to leap aside as it fell.\n\nAgony having seen this slows even more. Failing to conceal his careful examination of the floor as he continued forwards. Vaunea followed behind, glad to trace the steps of another person, hoping that would allow her to avoid further traps.\n\nKris paused for a moment to relax after the scare before striding confidently forwards, laughing at the trap's failure to catch them. Only to plunge straight into the next pit trap instantly dying on the spikes below.\n\nAnd so ended the life of the first adventurer, only a few minutes into their exploration of the tomb.\n\nUsing the communications crystals Agony and Vaunea called up to the wizards to inform them of the tragic circumstances, and request they send another adventurer down to join the party as soon as they arrived.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope you enjoyed the first part of our adventure. Let me know if you'd like to read more, sorry if my story telling isn't up to par.\n\n",

        "text": "Back with more! Sorry there’s a lot of time between these updates. I don’t have as much free time as I used to.\n\nPart Four: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/291gt6/doing_all_the_wrong_things_for_all_the_right/\n\nThe party set off for Bjorngard. They walked for several days until the gates of the town came into sight. It was a relatively small town, and the party could tell that it was just more or less a rest stop on the way to the northern capital of Frostholm.\n\nThe party decided to go to the local inn to check out rumors.\n\nWhisky: “So… uh, heard of any necromancers around these parts?”\n\nInnkeeper: “How… how did you know?”\n\nThe Innkeeper looked around nervously. The bar had a few patrons sitting at nearby tables talking over their drinks in hushed voices.\n\nInnkeeper: “Meet me in the back.”\n\nThe party got up and followed the barkeep. He shut the door behind them and talked in a nervous whisper.\n\nInnkeeper: “So, I see you’ve heard the rumors. Truth is, a powerful lich has stolen bodies from the graveyard and is doing gods-know-what with them. He’s… he’s in the basement. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone, but it looks like you four could take him out. Please, you must help me!”\n\nLankoris: “Woah, woah, woah, what the fuck? Are… are strong enough to kill this thing?”\n\nWhisky: “It matters not. Don’t be a pussy.”\n\nLankoris: “Are there even any other rules in your code?”\n\nWhisky: “Yes. ‘Do whatever is necessary to obtain more booze.’ This guy obviously has all the alcohol around here. If we didn’t help him, it would be a direct violation of Fen Yung Shwei’s code.”\n\nInnkeeper: “Oh thank you, heroes!”\n\nThe innkeeper pulled open a trapdoor in the floor, revealing a staircase that descended into the darkness of the basement. Whisky brazenly went down first, with everyone else tentatively following behind.\n\nThe basement was dark and spooky. With a successful perception roll, Whisky was able to see a robed figure hunched over an altar on the other side of the room.\n\nWhisky: “I sneak up behind him.”\n\nWhisky botched the sneak roll, and the lich turned around and screamed at them. Its eye sockets began to glow and flames began shooting out of its hands.\n\nJizzard: “Shit dude, run!”\n\nWhisky: “I punch him in the face.”\n\nWhisky sent a solid right hook into the lich’s jaw. It crumpled to the floor almost instantly.\n\nLich: “Wait, stop! Please don’t hit me again, I give up!”\n\nThe lich reached up and pulled its skeletal face off. As it turned out, it was just a mask.\n\nFake Lich: “Please, I can explain everything. I… I’m the innkeeper’s brother. Lately, we haven’t been making much money, so with the recent theft of bodies from the graveyard, we decided to… capitalize on the situation to bring in more customers. We thought it would bring in lots of adventurers who would buy drinks and then come down here and get scared and run away.”\n\nJizzard: “Well, that was a dumb fucking idea.”\n\nWhisky grabbed the fake lich by the back of his neck and hauled him back up the stairs. A sizable crowd had gathered to watch the proceedings, as the barkeep had gone around telling everyone that some brave people had gone down to kill the big scary thing.\n\nWhisky: “It’s all a hoax guys. There was no lich, just this guy.”\n\nRandom citizen: “Hey, that guy’s not a lich, he’s just a phoney!”\n\nAll the townsfolk began grumbling and left. The innkeeper looked really sad.\n\nJizzard: “You know what? I feel really bad for you guys. Here’s five gold. Use it to pay the rent or whatever.”\n\nAmanduh: “Now that that’s settled, we should go check out the graveyard.”\n\nThe party did so. Night had begun to fall, so the group hid in the bushes near the shallow graves that had been dug up. Sure enough, after a few hours, three skeletons carrying shovels showed up. One of them was wearing rusted old armor.\n\nThe first two were dispatched relatively easily by the Jizzard’s alchemical bombs. The armored one put up more of a fight, but was eventually killed when Lankoris shot it in the head with his bow, sending its skull careening off into the distance.\n\nAmanduh: “I take the skulls of the two that are right there..”\n\nI feel like now would be a good time to point out that Amanduh’s last name was “Skullfucker”.\n\nLankoris picked up the breastplate from the armored one, just in case it would come in handy later.\n\nJizzard: “So, there is evil at work here. I feel like we should let the king know about this. Lets head to Frostholm.”\n\nThe party set off on the road the next day. Early in the morning, they came across an elven merchant laying on the ground next to his cart getting the shit kicked out of him by two humans. Amanduh charged in and decapitated one of them. The merchant took advantage of the distraction and got back on his cart, saying a quick thank-you to the party before speeding away. Lankoris put a few arrows into the other one, dropping him.\n\nGuy full of arrows: “What… why?”\n\nWhisky: “Dude, you were kind of… killing that guy.”\n\nGuy full of arrows: “He… he sold us poisoned healing potions… killed one of our friends…”\n\nHe began coughing up blood and died.\n\nJizzard: “...Maybe we should have talked to them before we started killing people.”\n\nThe party continued down the road. They saw a small path leading into some nearby woods with a small plume of smoke in the distance.\n\nLankoris: “Let’s go check it out.”\n\nThe party ventured down the path and into the woods.  It twisted and turned a little bit, and eventually sent them into a small clearing with a little log cabin in the middle. Smoke was coming out of the chimney.\n\nThe Jizzard snuck up and peeked into the window. Inside, he could see an old lady putting something into an oven.\n\nJizzard: “Don’t worry guys, it’s just an old lady. Let’s go say hi.”\n\nWhisky knocked on the door and knocked on it. The old lady opened it and smiled.\n\nOld lady: “Oh boy, visitors! It gets so lonely out here. Please, come in, I’d love someone to talk to!”\n\nThe party went into the kitchen and sat down at the table.\n\nOld lady: “You brave adventurers are in for a treat! I’ve got one of my famous meat pies in the oven! But, on that subject, there’s a little problem I need help with. Lately, whenever I put one of my pies on the windowsill to cool, someone comes along and steals it. Could you help an old lady out?”\n\nThe party agreed, and hid in the trees for a while. Within a few minutes of the pie being set on the windowsill, a large ogre stomped into the clearing.\n\nLankoris: “What the fuck? Kill it!”\n\nWhisky charged at the ogre with his gore racial ability, critted the roll, and ended up knocking the ogre on its ass and dealing a ridiculous amount of damage. Amanduh then coup de graced it, killing the creature that I thought would be a decent challenge for them in two rounds.\n\nJizzard: “This is our swamp, bitch.”\n\nThe party went inside and told the old lady that the pie thief had been taken care of. She was overjoyed and gave everyone a slice once it cooled. It was really good.\n\nOld lady: “It’s so nice to have company. In fact... I wish you could stay here forever.”\n\nEveryone began to feel really sleepy. All of them but Amanduh passed their will saves, and Whisky flipped the table out of the way and punched the old lady in the face while Amanduh began snoring. The Jizzard then stabbed her in the back, killing her. Lankoris shook Amanduh awake.\n\nThe Jizzard looted the body and found a key. It opened the other door in the cabin, and the party entered the small room it led to. Inside, there was a table covered in blood with lots of sharp knives.\n\nLankoris: “This is beyond fucked up. I search the room.”\n\nMe: “In the corner, you see several sets of armor and weapons. They appear to have belonged to other adventurers who came this way before.”\n\nJizzard: “OH FUCK, THE PIES!”\n\nWhisky: “Lets take any gold in that pile and get the fuck out of here.”\n\nThe party, now very, very disturbed, continued down the road to Frostholm. As they got further north, everything got more snowy and cold. One day, they saw storm clouds on the horizon. A massive blizzard hit, and they were forced to find shelter. They searched for a while, nearly blinded by snow, and found a small cave with a light coming out of it. Inside, a small group of goblins huddled around a fire. One of them got up and hissed at the group.\n\nGoblin: “Hey! This our spot!”\n\nWhisky thought fast and pulled out his supply of hobbit pipe-weed.\n\nWhisky: “Now, now, let’s not be hostile here. I have some nice pipe-weed we could all enjoy.”\n\nHe made a fantastic diplomacy roll.\n\nGoblin: “Okay, we smoke with you.”\n\nThe goblins scooted over to make room for everyone and they hotboxed the cave while the blizzard raged outside. Despite the initial hostilities, everyone got along really nicely and eventually fell into a totally stoned slumber.\n\nThen Amanduh killed all the goblins in their sleep and took their skulls.",

        "text": "Last night was my first time DMing... and my first time playing D&amp;D 4e.\n\nA small group of us had gathered at a friend's place for a night of learning to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Only one of us was experienced in playing the game, so he was going to be our guide for the night. He arrived with a suitcase full of Monster Manuals and Dungeon Master's Guides &amp; etc., and over the next couple hours took us through creating our characters.\n\nBy the end of that, a naggling throat infection had taken its toll, and he was unable to continue to be our DM for the evening. Though my experience was limited to playing only three sessions of Pathfinders with a different group and listening to the [Nerd Poker](http://www.earwolf.com/show/nerd-poker/) podcast, I liked the idea of DMing so I offered to step up and keep the evening going, with the occasional help and input of our resident master.\n\nAnd holy hell was it fun.\n\nNot really having been prepared to DM, I dropped our adventurers into a local tavern and gave them a few hooks to investigate - an old man passed out beside his ale, a barkeep with rumoured ties to the local thieves guild, some rowdy drunkards harassing the barmaid, and some guys in dark cloaks talking in hushed voices around untouched ales.\n\nDesmond, the human sorcerer, was in a drinking match with somebody; Azrael, the dragonborn barbarian, was going around showing off trying to impress people; and Laria, the deva wizard, was inspecting the architecture. Laria's eye was caught by the old guy passed out beside his ale in the corner, with a fat coin purse beside him, so she went to investigate and discovered that the old guy was dead of poisoning.\n\nThe characters slowly came together (Desmond came over to see what was happening, Azrael came over to show off) and then formed a plan of what to do next.\nAzrael asked the barmaid if she had seen anything unusual. She mentioned that a man had come in asking if there were any travelers that would help him track down an artifact. She said he'd sat down and she'd brought him a drink, and pointed Azrael toward the old guy.\n\nLaria went and talked to the barkeep, who was rumoured to be involved with the local thieves guild. Displaying a lack of tact, she just asked flat out about how things seemed to go missing around these parts, and if anything suspicious was going on.\n\nThe group of hooded figures that had been sitting at a nearby table took notice, and one came over to ask if there was a problem. Laria said no and ordered a beer. The barkeep went to the back to fetch a fresh cask, prepared a beer and gave it to her.\n\nBack at the old dead guy, Laria wanted to search him for any clues, but the hooded figures were keeping an eye on them now, so a distraction was needed. Desmond and Azrael started a good old-fashioned bar brawl with the rowdy drunkards (that included some really great moments) and, using that distraction, Laria searched the dead guy and found a torn-off scrap of paper written in an unfamiliar language.\n\nDuring the bar brawl, a secondary brawl was started when Desmond sent one of the brawlers through a table (pissing off the patrons of that table) and thanks to some fortunate rolls we got some hilarity like a bear skull trophy getting dislodged from the wall and knocking a guy out (landing on his head like a bear skull hat) and another guy getting an epic wedgie over his eyes that blinded him for a round.\n\nAfter the brawl, near the end of which Azrael pulled out his axe and buried it in a guy's shoulder, they went to leave but were stopped as two town guards entered the tavern, having been fetched by a patron who ran out when the weapons were drawn.\n\nAnd that's where we left off.\n\nFor a first time DMing, I have to say that it was a lot of fun. It was massively helpful to have the experienced DM there to ask questions to, as I wasn't 100% on some of the mechanics and such, but it turned out well in the end and everyone had a good time. The experienced DM lent me his books, so I'm gonna study those and hopefully DM again in the future!\n\n**tl;dr** DMed for the first time after only experienced player lost his voice, made shit up, had a bar-brawl and a good time. 10/10 would DM again",

        "text": "Fallout 3.  Love it or hate it, many fans of the original games seem split between the excitement of the new direction for the series while others lament its decent into FPS gameplay.  Where do I stand?  I enjoyed the game, and still do on occasions when I decide to boot it up and romp into territories I briefly visited on my original play-through.  My first save since purchasing the game has survived the move to three computers, partly because of the sense of accomplishment I feel when I look at my bobble-head collection in my home of Megaton, digging through my lockers to view my collection of armors, hats, and weapons, all sorted by category, and selecting from such a treasure of how I am going to spend the next hour or so being a wasteland nuisance despite my positive karma with no intention of saving.\n\n \n\nHowever, there is one reason that stands above the rest.  While both FO3 and FONV are full of memorable characters and locations, it’s the events and atmosphere that truly define why I would rather play FO3 over NV.   This is a tale of watching the game take the reins and give me a spectacle that I wish I had backup saves from earlier so I could potentially witness it again.\n\n \n\nIn a time before DLC began to drop for FO3, I worked hard to acquire the necessary weapons, stats, and armor to begin the arduous task of mapping the entirety of the subway system.  This was something I originally avoided due to the hassle of super mutants that seemed to congregate outside the entrances no matter where I went.  Instead, I worked through the main story line while picking up side quests to work through as well.  Eventually, I turned my focus back on the subway system after I had cleared my way through Raven Rock (and the added bonus of unlocking Enclave drop-ship instances).\n\n \n\nSo I delved into the subway system in the heart of DC, working my way through ghouls and the occasional mutants.  What I didn’t count on was a little patch of city that served as an open area link between two subway entrances.  Here is where my story showed me why this game gave me one of my most enjoyable moments. \n\n \n\nUpon exiting the subway and climbing the escalator to the sun-soaked area, I happened upon a group of super mutants, some of them masters and some of them brutes.  I hid to see if I could get close enough to raise my VATS percentage for some easy surprise kills.  What I didn’t see was around some rubble was a BoS patrol that started its attack on the mutants when I got close enough to engage.  Once the battle started, I began taking pot shots to help out since their attention was on the patrol.  While this was happening, and after managing to kill a regular super mutant I heard that familiar sound I haven’t heard for a while. \n\n \n\nThe sound of an Enclave drop-ship dropping its payload of soldiers to my rear filled my speakers.  Immediately, they spotted the battle and began firing at me, the mutants, and the BoS patrol.  I scurried out of the way, using my remaining VATS to shoot one Enclave soldier in the helmet with my rifle.  Not very effective, but did take a chunk of health from him.  I ran and fired so I could link up with the BoS patrol, and having to stop and take some stimpacks so I make it across the remaining mutants to safety.  Once there, I could only stand and watch as the three way battle happened before my eyes.  Every once in a while I would take a shot of laser or bullet, but to sit there and watch this random event was the tipping point to realizing why I loved this game.  It took around five minutes of glorious combat, with probably around two into that the super mutants were wiped out from the crossfire that with some help from me the BoS were victorious.  The victory was not without tragedy though.\n\n \n\nIn the crossfire, I was maneuvering around to avoid the bullets that I was entering VATs and switching enemies that I neglected to realize I selected one of the BoS patrol.  This revelation came only when I was watch the cutscene where I turned and watched a bullet blast through the back of this unfortunate soldiers head.  He was dead.  When the smoke cleared, the patrol turned their sights on me.  I was an enemy of theirs.  I panicked and reloaded my autosave.  The scene did not play out like that again.  Instead I was given only a few mutants and no BoS or Enclave….",

        "text": "The other night was the first session for our group. We played a vaguely FATE-based game in a Pokémon setting after a long series of unfortunate events that kept postponing it. The system gives the players more control over the world and plot than most others, which has taught me never to plan more than ten minutes ahead. Players, without exception, always manage to derail the plot in thorough and unforeseeable ways. This session really drove the message home.\n\nStay tuned to find out how the simplest, most barebones and mundane “quest” managed to devolve into a Grand Theft Auto-style homicidal spree and police chase for unknown reasons.\n\nThe people of interest in this tale are Honza, a male barber, and Raggy, self-described “crazy rat lady”, a homeless woman obsessed with Rattatas. The first scene of the game and also their first quest involved saving a poor trainer getting mugged south of Viridian. Instead of facing the problem directly, the players decided to leave their most valuable possessions, their Pokémon, behind, and to approach the scene “stealthily”.\n\nOne of the muggers had a Rattata with him, which Raggy decided to surprise adopt. This led to Raggy being chased down by an Ekans while someone else's Pokémon was biting down on her arms to escape. This kept going all the way into the city, until Raggy couldn't take any more bites and dropped the Rattata. The police were alerted to the scene south.\n\nMeanwhile Honza decided to jump into the fray empty-handed to “save” the victim and their stuff. This ended up being a crazy wrestling match between Honza, the victim, and the two muggers, the result of which was an unconscious victim. Having agitated the aggressors thoroughly, Honza spontaneously decided to stop trying and to stay perfectly still, playing “cute and innocent” in order to prevent being murdered.\n\nThis actually worked, which unfortunately made the muggers attracted to the barber's... “charms”. Honza convinced the muggers that rape was bad, and then tried pleading with them to leave the victim's stuff behind, which failed. Doing absolutely nothing to prevent them, he let the muggers run away. Eventually the police arrive and run after the muggers.\n\nRaggy, patching herself up, was getting jealous she didn't have much to do, so she set out back to the crime scene with her Rattata so that it could meet its “new friend”. By the time she'd arrived there, an ambulance had been called to help the characters and the fainted NPC.\n\nRealising the Rattata of her desires had left with the muggers, Raggy proceeds to have a psychotic break and attack the paramedics. The intended effect was to sedate and lock Raggy up in a psychiatric ward, seeing as she was incapable of functioning in a polite society.\n\nInstead, a series of crazy rolls left Raggy locked up the back of the ambulance with the fainted NPC after tackling a paramedic really hard and breaking his ribs, with her Rattata on the drivers' seat, having tried attacking the driver but had instead fainted by getting choked. The driver, remaining paramedic, and a Chansey that had been kicked out of the ambulance were trying to open the locked back door, eventually opting for leaving the matter to the police reinforcements.\n\nBy this point, Honza had become exasperated with this insanity and had understandably run away from the danger. The police surrounded the ambulance with Growlithes, as Raggy used the unconscious body of the NPC they were supposed to help as a human shield. Half a dozen insane rolls and a fire extinguisher later, Raggy was in the driver's seat and was driving like crazy towards Pallet Town.\n\nNow, the problem is that Pallet is on the southern tip of a peninsula, so one can't run too far away. Reaching the sea, Raggy changes direction towards the Cycling Road on the east, dodging the trees and hills and other dangers of driving off road in a stolen ambulance with a bunch more insanely high driving rolls. Unfortunately the driving rolls weren't as good on the actual road, so she ended up running over and murdering a few cyclists with her ambulance.\n\nThe situation having become Grand Theft Auto, I decided I couldn't take much longer of this mess and dispatched Blue into the scene to take care of the psychopathic murderer terrorising the peace-loving people of Kanto. Raggy had to stop at the post at the end of the Cycling Road, separating it from Fuschia.\n\nA guard stopped Raggy, which I thought was a good thing, because it would allow Blue and the police time to catch up with the raving lunatic and end the session. What happened instead was that Raggy paralyzed the guard's Doduo by smacking its two heads together, while her Rattata was revived and mutilated the guard's genitals in a grotesque manner.\n\nFortunately this mess had given the Fuschia police time to camp outside the post and prevent Raggy's passing. Raggy barricaded herself inside the building and headed for the top floor, and by that time Blue had arrived with a Fearow and entered the building.\n\nThe idea was for Blue to use his Alakazam to put Raggy to sleep and hand her over to the police, which ought to be trivial given the difference in skill between the two trainers. Instead, Raggy once again let go of all rationality, and attempted to punch Blue before he could use his Poké Balls, rolling insanely high for both accuracy and power.\n\nThankfully this madness ended promptly with Fearow perceiving a threat towards its trainer, and drill pecking two holes in Raggy's abdomen, at which point she bled to death. Meanwhile Honza was in the police department getting debriefed.\n\nSo there you have it, folks. In first session of the game, we had attempted murders, attempted rapes, a successful killing spree, and one dead player, all before completing even the first quest. I've been promised no one will play a “crazy rat lady” in the future.",

        "text": "Once again it's time for a tale of that server I spent more time on than any other game I have ever played- Project Ares. This time, I'm talking about a map called Race for Victory. This is a Capture the Wool map, one of the first the server admins ever made, where one team must sneak across to the enemy base, steal two pieces of wool, get back and place them on their own base's victory monument. It's quite irregular as these maps go, as it has a small area full of lava between the two teams' lanes rather than a void gap. Again, you can likely find videos of it on Youtube. I just had a look on my own channel and I did a failed rush of the map at some point [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W29x9aOrLL4) The map is strange because it will either get rushed and one team will win within about two minutes of the game start, or it will drag on for an hour or so. If it does turn into a long game of defense, push and pull, it becomes incredibly exciting, as I will show you.\n\nI had been doing my usual thing which is defending the front line of my own side, shooting down any enemies that attempt to cross, listening for anyone who tries to tunnel underneath me. I had been working my way up through the gear, getting myself a bit of diamond mixed with enchanted iron, a nice sword and pick to help me find the tunnellers easier, etc. Then, at some point, I died. This then meant a mad dash to try and find some supplies, as on this map if it goes for more than about five minutes supplies start to run very, very low- mainly because of new players wasting them, but also because experienced players try to rush then die in lava or something. Usually the best thing to do is scour the front lines and try and pick up some loot from the deaths of the fighters there.\n\nSo I got some decent gear and made a run for it. I approach the massive defense they have built up in front of their wool room and burst through, arrows licking my heels. I make it in, pick up the wool and get some enchanted iron armour. Then I look outside. \n\nThis was the only wool we needed to win, and I was calling for my friend who had been helping me earlier. He was gone, likely because he felt the match was too much bother at this point. I looked out of the wool room, alone, and saw almost all their defenders looking back at me- at least two thirds of their team set on making sure I didn't escape. They shot at me from outside the wool room, from ontop of their base, everywhere. There was no escape whatsoever.\n\nSo I waited. I got a kill or two, sniping away. But this would be no good. I had little food or arrows, I had to make sure my armour didn't break- waiting was all I could do. Wait for them to let me out. Which is of course the wise thing for any defender to do. So I waited for so long that I actually left the game to go and have a shower. I had a twenty minute shower, and when I came back the game was still on.\n\nSo I charged. I ran out of the wool room, down a tunnel, out onto the surface, over a precarious bridge on fire across the lava, and onto my side. I madly blockspammed up to the victory monument, and placed it.\n\nAfter more than an hour, I had won!",

        "text": "Gather round everyone. This old King will tell you the tale of his darkest hour in his Minecraft career. \n\nAfter a while playing nothing but the Overcast Network, I began to yearn once again for the days when I was someone- not just another soldier in an army that changed hundreds of times a day. I wanted to do what every man that ever set foot into the blocky world wanted to do, I wanted to build, make my mark on a permanent world as the leader of a group dedicated to creation.\n\nSo, in cover of darkness, I posted on the Overcast Network forums and asked people to come to a point on the road just south of Civcraft's centre. This was because that was the peaceful town of Carbon, and the centre of the map was Kappi, a city owned by griefers that would \"pearl\" (basically capture you and leave you in the end with nothing) you without a second thought. \n\nI travelled from my own spawn point where I had set up a small home on a mountain months earlier, at the first day of Civcraft 2.0 (if you don't know, the tale of how Civcraft 1.0 was destroyed by the collective efforts of a few bad apples from HCFactions is a great story. Go have a look at some of the top posts on /r/Civcraft). I passed through a few abandoned looking cities, and when I arrived at Carbon I had to wait a short while for the others to arrive so I explored.\n\nSomeone started calling for me, and I went and found them. They were in one of Carbon's public wheat fields, breaking wheat willy nilly. A Carbon resident nearby was getting irritated by this, when suddenly the apparent griefer turned his sword on me. He outgeared me a slight bit, having full iron, however I don't think he had a bow- nor did he have the excellent iron tier PVP skills I had acquired from more than a year playing Project Ares. I blockspammed away from him, meaning that I placed blocks under my feet as I ran so it would be hard for him to follow, then after heading through one of the great arches of Carbon's streets turned and connected two arrow shots onto his chestplate. Then we charged each other, and I bested him at melee. His stuff fell into the sea alongside Carbon and I picked it up and stuffed most of it into a chest, leaving a sign. As I had no enderpearl, he was not pearled, so he respawned somewhere else on the server and I messaged him that his stuff was waiting for him where he fell. I took a diamond or two as, uh, tax. That, to this day, is the only life I ever took on Civcraft.\n\nThe Carbon resident, darkaegis, and I became good friends, although we have not met since. We often messaged each other if we were both online. By all accounts Carbon is now going through a resurgence, especially as Kappi is now a much more welcoming area and no longer harbors most of the major griefers.\n\nThen people started to arrive, and myself and my new second in command Leemonadeport started our epic journey across the world to find a place to settle.\n\n[to be continued]",

        "text": "This happened ages and ages ago but seeing people post Minecraft stories on here has made me post it.\n\nThis happened more than a year ago on a server that is now known as the Overcast Network. However at the time it was smaller in terms of popularity and was known exclusively for its one gamemode- Project Ares. If you don't know, Project Ares maps usually pit one big red team vs one big blue team in an attempt to capture wool, get kills, score in goals or, in this particular map, destroy the core.\n\nNow this map, Battle of Tenjin, you can probably look it up on Youtube or whatever. But basically, it is two large asian castles with a farm kind of area in front of them, both on square islands seperated by a large void gap. The core, an obsidian lump filled with lava which the enemy must try to leak, is suspended in front of the main base of each team.\n\nThe other thing about Battle of Tenjin is that there is a secret chest on both sides (as they are identical) that few know about. It's buried on the top floor underneath some iron block supplies. This means that to get it, you either go grab a pick from the supply chest and mine the iron on the top floor, or you can get it from the roof- which is quicker and my preferred method. Many don't realize that as the map was made before wooden slabs could only be broken with an axe, the slabs on this map are mineable with a pick.\n\nSo anyway one particular game, I got the chest- Power 3 bow, knockback 2 iron sword, 3 (non-OP) golden apples. As any pvper would know, this kit is essentially a bow spammer's dream. Knock em back with the sword and finish them off with three shots then quickly regen with an apple.\n\nMy team had a skybridge that went across to the enemy core but it was as yet unfinished. I managed to get into the enemy base over the void bridges and through their tunnels. What followed can best be described as an insane game of cat and mouse, as I slowly but surely killed all the defenders on the ground outside their spawn (under the core). They kept coming back at me after respawning and regearing but of course they could barely land a hit before my bow tore them apart. \n\nBy this point my team had finally made it to the core from their bridge. There were a lot of enemies still on the core, and I helped to pick them off whilst I had been forgotten by all but one or two dedicated revenge enthusiasts down below. The core however was still obsidian, and the sheer number of my team on it meant that breaking it without someone else interfering was difficult. \n\nMeanwhile the enemies kept attacking the core breakers, and I kept shooting them in the back. At last, the core went to gold mode, but still, in the confusion of so many red and blue players jostling over the golden sphere, it went unbroken. The attacks of the defenders became more frenzied- they would attempt to punch my guys off with no armour at all, and all the while I was completely forgotten- and just kept shooting away.\n\nHowever I had one problem. A bow in Minecraft without any sort of durability enhancement only has about 300 uses. Whilst others were able to repair their unenchanted bows from the loot dropped by enemies, I could not for fear of losing my Power 3 enchantment. My bow was running out of time.\n\nJust as I noticed this, the core began to seep that hot red fluid that every Minecrafter knows all too well. Lava had begun to leak from the core and our mission was finally over. I had racked up more than 80 kills in one game.",

        "text": "Maybe 2 or so years ago, I joined some of my friends on a factions server. Things were going nicely, we got ourselves a quaint underground base. Our mine was plentiful and we got ourselves plenty of diamonds. We got some nice enchanted gear, and some basic potions. We weren't keen on rp-ing, and neither was the rest of the server. Except for the Tigers, I can't remember the actual name so let's just go with Tigers. They ruled the land with an iron fist, and by \"ruled\" I mean they demanded diamonds or they would kill you. \n\nBefore I go on, I'll introduce the power system. Each person in a faction had an individual power, and everyone's power was added up to create the faction's power. The way to get power was pretty simple, you could mine ores, every 1000 coal/lapis/redstone would earn you 1 power, every 100 iron is 1 power, and every 10 diamonds would earn you 1 power. You could also get power by killing other players, 4 per kill. If the player in question had negative power, you wouldn't get any points. Once you reached 20 power, you could only gain power by killing people. Power had no upwards limit, but the minimum you could have would be -10. You could only lose power by dying. -2 by players and -15 by mobs. Players would periodically receive rewards for their individual power, and a faction would earn upgrades based on their faction power. If their power dropped below a certain number, that upgrade was gone. I've probably messed up some numbers there, it's been a while.\n\nAfter some reconnaissance, (/f power Tigers or something like that) we found that the Tiger's power was a single digit above the upgrade that locked any chests in your faction's territory. We knew that could not pass, we passed a rumor around the server. We would fight the tiger's 2nd in command, the reason we'd fight the 2nd in command is because the tiger's leader was a god among men with insane armor and a sword that could cut through our men like butter. My faction outvoted me 4-1 and volunteered me for the mission. They gave me some good gear and sent me out. I met the man out by a river right by spawn, and I also met some other factions out there two. Maybe 3 others lined up with me and we fought, we fought tooth and nail. 4 of us came out and he did the whole usual ragequit switcheroo, talking about how we were hacking and how he was going to get us banned. I rolled my eyes and went back to my faction base, leaving the loot for the 3 guys who helped me. I grabbed my friends and we tp-ed back to spawn. Tiger2 was still at spawn, afk after he threw a temper tantrum. We lured a skeleton to him at spawn, since pvp was disabled there. The skeleton killed him, and Tiger was now down 17 power. Their chests were ours, granted we could get into their base. I asked where their base was, and my friends pointed to the giant monolith that was their base. It was a huge giant pillar, taking up an area that was maybe 32x32, the entire base was covered with lava. The outside of it being completely locked up. It was protected with their faction power too. I grabbed some obsidian, and built a portal outside their base, I walked a couple blocks in the nether and built another portal there and went through it. Boom, I was in their base, I told my guys to come through, we grabbed all their loot, it took multiple trips, and we hauled it all back to our base. The first thing we did? We through it in the lava. We were getting bored of that server anyway.",

        "text": "I can't remember when it was I fell asleep, but I awoke to the shrill, worried warnings of my lieutenant. He shook at the collar of my dark leather jerkin, his breath smelling of stale hardtack and well water.\n\n“Commander Kovarian! The host of King Graveth has completed the construction of their siege engine outside of our gates. They could launch an assault any second now!”\n\nI couldn't yet see. I swiped right to left in front of my face, groggy and not quite taking in my boy’s words. “Mm. Mm, right then, carry on,” I said, my tongue rolling lazy. I felt a bale of hay at my bottom, and I started to smell that certain infamous scent that permeates wherever horses are kept.\n\nThen it hit me. I slapped the boy with the back of my hand by reflex. “Oi, what!? Rally the men! The horn, use the horn,” I commanded him. Leonard, the lieutenant, reeled back, digging his fingers into the reddened spot on his cheek where I had hit him. His voice came out muffled, and he spoke as he turned to leave the stables. “As you command, sir.”\n\nI rocked off the pile of hay, dusted my trousers off as well as I could, and put a hand up to heed the boy. “Oh, my bad, Leonard. I hadn't meant to do that.” He only chuckled and went off on his way. “Please, sir, if I couldn't take a hit like that, it would be a bloody disgrace to have me serving under your command.”\n\nI shook my head and retired to picking straw from my clothes. My reputation saved me once more, I suppose. I began petting the horses, feeding one or two, as I waited for Leonard to climb up one of the towers and call the alarm. The horses were troubled and panicky, I noticed. Animals are considerably apprehensive beings. \n\nSuddenly, there was the sound of a blade of steel rapping against the stable’s crude wooden gate. I turned to find Lord Beranz, the Lord of the castle my men and I were besieged within, looking upon me with quite the rude expression on his face. His eyebrows were arched upwards in the most annoying way possible, one corner of his mouth curled up in a smirk.\n\n“I caught your little messenger boy while out for a stroll, Kovarian. Can’t believe he told you before he did me of the incoming assault,” he said, his voice mighty pompous.\n\n“Don’t really see why that’s such a surprise, now. That boy serves me, not you. He has been with me since the beginning, and he is no mere courier. I know he'll be a great swordsman one day.”\n\n“That boy may serve you, but you serve me. So, really, he serves me too,” Lord Beranz responded. He seemed to hesitate a bit before continuing on. “This warband of yours, this crude mob of dressed-up villagers, sellswords, and hunters? The one that’s been ‘with you since the beginning'? Every single one of them serves me above you.”\n\n“If you don’t appreciate my men, I can tell all the Rhodok legions camping outside of your walls that. I think they’d be happy to let us be on our merry way,” I said back to him.\n\n“Don’t be a fool, you,” Beranz spat as he walked into the stables and closed the gate behind him. I believe I may have angered him the slightest amount. “My army could be outnumbered by that false king Graveth’s host seventy to one and we’d still take his head with nary a casualty. I fear not that King of Rags and his little band of peasants. By the gods, I’ll take ‘em all on just by myself. Pikes and board shields are wretched, revolting weapons fit for wretched, revolting men. The only reason the Rhodok Republic still exists is because we Lords of Swadia haven’t the time to waste on such pest control.”\n\nBeranz suddenly drew his longsword from its scabbard and thrusted it right at me, its blade moving in a polished white blur. I reached to my belt, pulled out my dagger, and parried it just in time, hitting it off to rest on my shoulder. Even through the leather of my jerkin, I felt the cold chill of the lord’s blade. He only smirked and tilted his head.\n\n“As for me, personally? I’m aching in my chainmail to be the one to put Graveth’s head on a pike atop the gates of Uxhal, and it looks as if this siege here is going to be my opportunity to do this. The only reason your men are still here is because his majesty King Harlaus entrusted your army to assist in Vyincourd’s defense himself, and I am not stupid enough to cross him. His ‘absolute dearest mercenary’, he said you were.\n\nLord Beranz took his blade from my shoulder and began gently tracing down the center of my chest and abdomen. “Personally, I don’t see the appeal.”\n\nI glanced first at the blade and then at Beranz’s self-indulgent grin. Gods his mustache was disgusting. “If this is about my choice in fashion, my lord, my suit of plate is awaiting me in my tent. I just keep this light protection on at all times, in case some clever soul decides to sneak up on me with a sword in a dark place.”\n\nHe scoffed. “Well, I certainly hope that plate of yours looks more pleasant than this leather. How ragged and filthy.”\n\n“I apologize for it not being up to your standards, my Lord, but it truly is no fault of mine. This armor’s been tested in battle much more than I’d rather it have been. It’s not shiny like yours, nor nice and sparkly.”\n\nLord Beranz’s grip tightened around the hilt of his weapon. “Ah, of course, the quarrels and squabbles of the common folk are aplenty. Not that I would know, I’ve only heard about them through obituaries and scary stories.”\n\n“Oh, I used to love scary stories. I’d offer to compare how many you know to how many I do, but my mother stopped reading to me in my bed at night long ago, so I’d be at quite the disadvantage.”\n\t\nBeranz twisted his blade to the side and swept upwards, cutting off a tuft of the hair behind my ear. “Watch your tongue, you lowborn sellsword filth,” he grunted as he turned on the heel of his black boot and began walking off. He opened the gate, put one foot out into the castle courtyard, and turned back to face me.\n\t\n“Your men are here to serve as shields of meat to mine. Do not forget that. I want your archers on the walls, mine will take the towers. Put your best pikemen, if you have any, right where Graveth plans to lead the siege engine, your swordsmen right behind them.”\n\t\n“As you command, Lord Beranz. We will defend Vyincourd Castle with our lives.” I made sure to sound as uninterested and ingenuine as possible.\n\t\n“Of course you will, Commander.”\n\t\nHe turned and left, closing the gate again behind him. I breathed a sigh of relief and turned back to the horses. “By the Gods that mustache. Horrid, ain't it?” I asked one of the mares. It up and neighed in response.\n\t\nI shook my head and ran a hand through my hair. “What a lovely man,” I grunted to myself. “Well, I guess Leonard is taking a while to climb that tower. Probably being picked on by Beranz’s fat old knights every step o’ the way. I might have time for some more shut-eye, thank the-” I began to mutter before hearing the unmistakable blowing of the war horn.\n\t\n“Ah. Ah, oh shit.”\n\t\nI sheathed my dagger, picked up my bastard sword from the stack of hay I had hidden it in, and headed off to rally the men in the courtyard. It was time to break the siege of Vyincourd Castle.\n\t\n",

It ranged from shutting off the internet to electricity in the room (we were friends with the RD) to screwing with the sound system in producing the wrong audio or too loud/too low.  \n\nThis specific story had to do with our friend who was always boasting he could do anything and always was the best at gaming.  So one of our friends worked in the tech department and we put a plate under his chair in our room  (it was one of the ones you can pick up at walmart and was metal) and had someone sit behind him and every minute or so when he was getting to a tricky part in the game we would shock his chair and it was great.\n\nHe continued to fail at the level of mario RPG and became really frustrated.  The best part is he did not figure it out until about the third time we did it to him; as in the third time he came over, not the third time we shocked him.  It was pretty fun to continue doing this to him even if he did not learn humility.\n\nI was asked to tell this tale in order to also ask for survey respondents by your mods.  My survey is on gamers and preferred genres of play.  You will get a free personality test out of it.  I can answer any questions about it and will be watching the thread and responding.

Representatives of the 3 major clans are competing over claim of an island.\nThe party:\n\n* A short, angry Crab Clan rep, with multiple ties to every bit of gang activity on the island. Self-described as \"Samurai Mojo Jojo\"\n\n* A tall man in black representing the Crane Clan, with a half-mask over his mouth in order to cover the burn scars and full Light Armor to cover the rest of the burns all over his body. Very adamant about winning over the island through fortifying defenses against native monsters, and adopting the philosophy of \"Survival of the Fittest.\" Very intimidating demeanor, especially since he's the shugenja and can summon a katana made of *fire* at will. Self-described as \"Samurai Darth Vader.\"\n\n* A large, brolic-as-fuck Mantis Clan representative, dedicating himself to using his men to build schools, stop petty crime, and the player himself helping out every little girl that drops her ice cream cone. Described as \"Samurai Superman\"\n\nWe were brought into a temple by a mysterious old man who seemed to know an unsettling amount about all of our backstories. He made repeated propositions that a partnership could be in place if any of us had anything to offer him that he'd want. Turns out, none of us really did. He takes us down a corridor, to a small platform over a lake, and takes the bag off his hostage--our Imperial Magistrate. He says we should give up, he's infiltrated our organization, and we're pretty much boned. Crane steps up, sensing that this old man is another Shugenja, and says \"I have one question. If you wished for us to have no chance against your incredibly elaborate plan... Why bring the three of us into an isolated, enclosed space?\" And with that, whipping his firesword out.\n\nThe thing is, the Shugenja quickly revealed himself as a Blood Mage. He had a bunch of cronies throughout his lair now revealed to be *mind-controlled MANTIS* guys.\n\nSo the battle begins. I go into my awesome **wizard-on-wizard-battle**. However, just as I get first blood and chop of some of the old man's fingers, the Mantis guy is *enraged* at this guy taking control of members of his clan. He *barrels* past two of his mind-controlled clansmen, and just as the Crane and the old man are having their witty wizard banter about who knows the most forbidden knowledge, the Mantis is heard off to the side cursing like Yosemite Sam before fucking **bushwhacking** the old man and tackling his ass off the platform, into the water, where he proceeds to pull out his sword and **BISECT THE MOTHER FUCKER**. \n\nThe Crab, now finally getting his turn after rolling last for Initiative, proceeds to walk to the edge going \"Yeah that's *right!* Mess with the Crab and that's what you *get*, dickeater!\"\n\nThe mind-control spell is broken. The Crane stands bewildered by what just happened for a solid 5 minutes.",

        "text": "Skip to the line if you want the story faster.\n\nShort description: I host a minecraft server so me and a few friends can mess around in. It uses the crackpack mod pack which focuses on PvP combat and has a ton of awesome things in it. We all agreed we'd leave each other and their stuff alone until a month has gone by, then the rules of PvP would be discussed and agreed upon. This story takes place about 2.5 weeks from the start.\n____________________________________________________\n\nI had an awesome base, I had technology and thaumology set up, logistics pipes, computers, it was almost fully automated. Nearly unlimited resources and I would trade with other players to help them out. I put my my blood, sweat and tears into that base, so many resources and so many hours Googling for answers to each mod.\n\nI work nights. One night I come online and I find my base has been destroyed. Everything was taken or broken. From all my resources in my computer, to my large multi-block structures. And to top it off, it was pretty much encased in lava.\n\nI was heart broken. I was just staring at it for about 20 minutes straight. Then I tried to find out who did this. Looking through the server logs I find that only one person has been on since i logged off. Lets call him G.\n\nG didn't know a couple of things. 1. That I had a back up base with a ton of resources. 2. The back up base is where I kept my missles. 3. I know more things about applied energistics mod than he does. and 4. I've known where his base was for a long time.\n\nREVENGE: I went to his base and wrote down the coordinates to his bed, since I know he logs off from there and logs in from there. I went back to my base and sent all of my missiles to that location. which consisted of multi cluster nukes and thermometric missiles. Notice I didn't take anything back from him. He can enjoy his stolen items in hell.\n\nI wasn't close to done yet though. Now for those of you that don't know, there is an ender missile that can send you to the end and you have to face the ender dragon. You cant escape from that place without killing the dragon. But that wasn't good enough for me. That allowed the possibility for escape.\n\nSpending time assembling my trap for him by asking for resources from another friend. I created a pressure plate activated spatial containment structure. What this structure does is it takes matter and converts it into data on a special hard drive. It's a cool way to move a base. Also it traps players with no hope for escape without outside assistance. you're trapped in a 3X3 square in darkness.\n\nHe logged in. Saw his ruined base. Then triggered my trap.\n\nI have that hard drive buried in a chest, in the twilight forest. He was very upset at this new turn of events. I told him that if he had a minecraft family, i would have killed them in front of him.\n\nI'm enjoying my new base very much. More security this time around. I still feel there was more I could have done. Any ideas?\n\n",

I don't wanna advertise here, so if you want more info on the server PM me. There's more that happened after the story, so I might write a part two if people want me to.))\n\nWar was fucking loud.\n\nSir Robert Giric did not so much think this as feel it as the din of war cries bounced off of his eardrums. The assorted motley of men behind him would, on a normal day, each have a voice of their own, a tune that was distinctly theirs. Now all those voices meshed into a giant glob of fury and passion. Some yelled names, or phrases. \n\n\"Alexios!\"\n\n\"Honor!\"\n\nBut loudest of all was \"EDMUND! THE TRUE KING! EDMUND!\"\n\nAnd Deus bless them all, they were going to fight and die for Edmund, the true King.\n\nWhen the King of Cathalon had died, he left no heirs. The feudal vassals of Cathalon, the Barons, the heads of the ancient clans, had been summoned to the capital, also called Cathalon. Chief among them were Owyn O' Islebach, Hywel Helmont, and of course, Edmund Dunham.\n\nEdmund was a solemn man. He had not been trained to rule. He had been trained to help his elder brother administer the Barony of Dunham. However, his elder sibling fell over into the sea, and upon his father's death he was raised to the Baronship of his clans ancient seat, Dunham. That peaceful little farming hamlet by the river.\nEdmund was just. He was strong. He was a good man. But not so good at the details. That was where Sir Robert came in. Clan Giric had been sworn to the Dunhams for generations, and as Steward, Giric was the right hand man to the stern-faced lord. Robert loved him. He would even die for him.\n\nSo it was that when Edmund Dunham left for that historic council, Sir Robert Giric had found himself watching over the community. He had been inspecting some of the grain from the previous harvest when Edmund came galloping down the road with his bodyguard, Gorgrim, a hulking sack of toughness. He hopped off his mount and stormed into the manor. When he finally came out, he said but one word to Robert.\n\n\"War.\"\n\nOwyn O' Islebach had been selected as King. Edmund was of a mind that he had no right. He detested the man. So it was that his lord and himself found themselves sitting in front of the small man known as the King of Paralon.\n\nParalon was a small island a few dozen miles off the coast of Cathalon, and it was rich beyond belief. The center of the church, and more importantly, the center of trade, it was wealthy and fertile. It also had a very large standing army.\n\nThe King, Alexios I, was not a very impressive man. Average build, average looks, very... average. But there was cunning in his eyes. Islebach could do nothing to benefit him, but if Edmund gained the throne, he would owe him a debt. The men of Cathalon always paid their debts.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Constable of Paralon, a man known as Clotaire, stood next to Giric on the prow of the warship. Behind him, sailors were preparing a massive ballista. The man seemed not to care in the least, as if he were just sipping wine like any other day. At least his accent was understandable.\n\n\"This is a glorious day, knight, no? We will be having much glory and womens. Much womens, yes.\"\n\nAt last they landed. Gorgrim had assembled the levy from Dunham, and the soldiers, many poorly equipped, were encamped outside the city walls. They had gotten there too late. Men from Islebach and Helmont had gained control of the city first. But it did not matter. Soon those men would be dead.\n\nThe Paralonian fleet stood proud in the bay, but no one that day stood taller than Edmund Dunham. Brilliantly clad in his plate, with the ancestral sword of Clan Dunham, Tusk, at his hip, he walked down the gangplank of the flagship like some hero out of a story. He stepped to a particularly high rock, facing his army. Paralonians, new to this place. Loyal soldiers who had served him for years. Sellswords, who Robert made sure to keep an eye on. A large majority were normal folks, conscripted, wielding rusted blade or farming tools. But all were eager.\n\nEdmund was not a fan of speeches. He nodded once. That was all he needed to do. \n\nThe chants began. War was fucking loud.\n\nSuddenly, Robert felt the air shift, and then almost immediately after a loud 'THUMP'. The ballistas from the fleet were firing, and gradually chipping away at the gate into the city. With each tumble of stone there was a loud cheer, until finally the wall was dust and the men loyal to Islebach were all that stood in the gap.\n\nGiric felt his feet moving. Actually, he felt a lot of feet moving. The assorted soldiers were streaming forth like some ungodly flood of steel, and the sounds of combat began to emerge. He drew his arming sword. Just in time, too. A dirty looking man with a pitchfork stabbed at him. No matter. He was a knight. He was trained for this. Two slashes was all it took to cut the man down. \n\nThe next man was a sellsword, he could tell by the nasty quality of his chain mail and the dirtiness of his face. A bit tougher, but no true challenge. The mercenary fell eventually. A quick look around showed that the resistance of the enemy was wavering. It was full on chaos now. Blood flew, swords birthed sparks, and screams were ever present. A watch tower fell, a victim of the ballistas, crushing a group of soldiers. Robert saw Edmund, almost gracefully hacking down challengers with Tusk. He moved forward to join him at his side.\n\nHe was interrupted by a smash of pain.\n\nHe looked downwards to find an arrow lodged in his calf. He muttered a prayer in thanks for his heavy mail. He leaned down to pull it out, but was again struck in the back. He stumbled. There was another flash of pain, he couldn't tell where, and then the world was black.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHe woke on a featherbed and blinked his eyes open. He attempted to rise, but a shock of agony in his lower back stopped him in his tracks. Damn. Had they failed? Was he a prisoner, awaiting execution, spared a hard cell only because he had a little title in front of his name? If only he could look out the window.\n\nInstead he turned to the door as it swung open, and in marched Edmund Dunham with his normal grave expression. This time, though, there was a slight smile on his face.\n\nAnd a crown on his head.",

(maybe i'm using the wrong keywords?)\n\nThe man premise was that a party encounters an impassable pit, they can't seem to get around it in any way, so the group's necromancer decides he is going to continuously summon zombies or skeleton's and send them into the pit until it is full enough that they can cross.\n\nRing any bells?

        "text": "A little backstory. I managed to get into rping a while back, picking up a couple free rulebooks that seemed pretty inclusive. (One thing I found in my searches was basically storytelling, but the players determine their characters actions. There are no dice or rules except what the GM says.) I also got my friend into RPGs. I'm more of a player, and he is more of a storyteller, so he usually GMs for us, but when I do GM, either everything must be perfect, or come up with it as I go.\n\nSo when we were at church camp the other day, we were walking down the path, and I said, \"You stand in front of a cave, what do you do?\" I will now tell the story of what happens when I am telling a story and I have no plot.\n(Italics are my thoughts, details, and what he doesn't know.)\n\n***\n\nHe appears in front of a cave/dungeon *it's a neat and orderly cave for an OCD mind*, in a fjord in a mountain range. He enters the cave and sees an unlit torch *I want electricity.* and a switch. *Flip the switch! There will be an archway to see, else a dead end.* He elects to go deeper into the cave. *Crap* He runs his hand down the side, *I want you to flip the switch!* He hits the dead end and comes back down the other side. *No passages for you!* He falls down a hole. He jumps and climbs out, and returns to the entrance. He flips the switch *Finally. I'll put a handle on the ceiling for him to pull.* My friend doesn't tell me that he looks around, so he leaves without noticing the handle. He leaves the fjord and goes east. He comes to a cliff overlooking a A Massive Plain. *It's literally called, \"A Massive Plain.\"* He observes and sees brown specs of presumably animals and people. In a fit of forgetfulness, he heads towards the specs...\n\nAnd falls down the cliff to his death.\n\nLaughing, it never happened and he respawns at the top of the cliff. He goes north, but the cliff continues since half the entire continent dropped. He goes back toward the mountain range. Since it's dark, he begins to look for shelter. He finds a shack. *But I decide that he found a Shaq.* He asks what the shack looks like, and I say, \"About 7-8 feet tall, black, wearing a Lakers jersey, and holding an orange sphere.\" Not understanding, he laughs, and asks me what the shack looks like. With an entirely straight face, I say, \"About 7-8 feet tall, black, wearing a Lakers jersey, and holding an orange sphere.\" This happens several times before he understands that this is Shaq.\nAbout this time, another friend comes upon us, and we explain what is going on. Friend2 offers to be any random enemies or forces, like storms, etc. So he becomes Shaq. Friend1 tries to make small talk, but Shaq aggros and his basketball multiplies and turns into a small basketball mech. Extremely confused, Friend1 turns and runs. Outpacing Mecha!Shaq, he heads to the fjord. In the first chamber, he falls asleep. When he wakes up, Mecha!Shaq is standing in the entrance, menacingly. Friend1 frantically looks around and finally sees the handle. He runs to pull it. He jumps, pulls it... And nothing happens. So he dives towards the hole and hides. Then the floor lowers and the hole is no more. Friend1 sees an archway on the opposite side of the now wider cave, and runs towards it. When he is completely enshrouded by darkness, he is standing on a rock that is completely surrounded with lava, inside a rock dome that has no entrances or exits. Friend1 tries to go back and flip a switch that he saw in the main cave, but he is informed that he is no longer in a cave. He has to process this \"crazy\" information, and then he looks around. All he sees is a small depression in the center of the rock. As he is examining it, he is pushed back, and he can't get closer to the depression. Then a basketball appears.\n\nShaq appears behind him. Friend1 turns around, and Shaq explains basketball.*The mechanism for playing basketball in an rpg, with no dice or stats is really confusing.* Anyways, the game is tied 2-2, and no one cares for the mechanics, so somehow, they fall in the lava. *I think Shaq tackled Friend1.* It turns out that Friend1 only landed his face in the lava before an opening appears and they land in hospital beds, in a hospital, *obviously*. Friend2 wanted to stop playing Shaq, so he sits up, and upon seeing Friend1's face, dies of a heart attack. Friend1's face looked like Two-Face's bad side, on both sides of his face. After half of his 400 days bedrest is up, he looks like Two-Face. *I will mention that Friend1 has not seen The Dark Knight.* On the 200th day of rest, a nurse comes in, wearing a paper mask and with green hair. The scene from The Dark Knight plays out, with me saying that specific rolls are happening. I say that he fumbles some rolls, and ends up shooting the Joker and going from LG to LE because his (nonexistant) life has tumbled down around him. Friend1, very prudish and very Christian, was not happy with the prospect of being \\*E, so he uses a [LURP](http://www.fearrpg.net)*LUck Reroll Point* and I say that he fumbles the reroll but 20's the fumble roll. He shoots the Joker, by a slip of the finger, but remains LG. The hospital starts exploding, but there is a pause, so he leaves the room and heads down the hallway. He tries to go down the elevator, but the rest of the hospital is blown up. The explosions restart, beginning at the opposite end of the hallway. *Getting him to solve this puzzle the way I wanted him to was really hard and still ended up failing.* He checks the waiting rooms, and sees your average waiting room, with phones and phone lines. *I wanted him to get the phone lines, tie them together and climb down the shaft.* He tried every possible method up to and including getting one phone line, but he didn't unplug it in his own mental picture, so he abandoned that route. *RAGE* He died several times before I finally had to give him the win. Deaths include: \n\n* Grabbing the elevator cables and sliding down. He basically got rope burn and let go, falling to his death.\n* Loitering.\n* Various other attempts to slide down the elevator cables.\n\nEventually *I couldn't think of an excuse for killing him*, so he solved it by removing his hospital gown, which he did reluctantly, and using it to guard his hands. As he climbed over the piles of hospital rubble, the last remaining wing, (his wing) exploded, and chunks landed on him. The pain of his face was so strong that he grabbed the Joker's gun that was conveniently nearby, and shot himself.\n\nThat was quickly rejected, and instead, the pain was so great that he died of a heart attack.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThen he wakes up in the first chamber of the cave, with Mecha!Shaq standing in the entrance menacingly.",

Each person would run a night, everyone would make new characters, until we all found something we were willing to play*\n\n[Part 1: The island](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/28xjtr/dd_4e_blitz_dming_part_1_the_island/)\n\nOur second night of Blitzing wasn't as eventful as , well, any of the other parts. Jordan was running it and he wasn't as prepared, mentally, to run a game. He had some concept of the world where he threw us, but what I would call his stage presence was lacking. Too often, he's willing to sit back and let other players do things. We've been trying to wean him off of that and into more prominent party position, mainly because when he's in character, he STAYS in character. He's chars tend to have accents that he's able to hold sentence after sentence, without wavering and losing the accent. Which impresses me.\n\nI don't know who anyone was playing but myself. Back 4 years ago, when I had started playing with this group, the concept of Miguel, Lord of the Dance had somehow stuck in my mind. I wanted him to be fast and graceful and that's all the characterization I had come up with in 4 years. I finally through numbers on paper and was playing him as a scout, i believe, for the sheer maneuverability.  \n\nThe best thing this session did for me was knock that concept out of my head. Miguel, as a character and a concept, couldn't roleplay, couldn't fight, shouldn't skill check. He was nothing but a half baked idea and I'm glad he flopped in a one-of instead of the first night or two of a three month campaign.\n\nAs for that evenings plot, there was something about a potential necromancer, we did a bit of detective work, and we got attacked by some undead demon goat or something. We spent a bit of time trying to pin down exactly how the kingdom was organized, which was useful the next time we came back here.\n\nThe most memorable thing of the night was:\n\n    **Jordan:** The king is attended by the grand vizer and-\n    **Matt:** I kill the Vizer before he gets a chance to betray anyone.\n    **All:** Laughter (on jordan's part, the kind that covers up a massive rewrite to the plot)\n",

        "text": "I would like to issue a challenge to people to write poetry about what is happening in their games. This could take any of a number of forms, including, but not limited to, haiku, tanka, cinquain, limerick, or sonnet. These poems could be about a certain character, place, or event, but will hopefully tell a bit of a story. I will get things started in the comments.\n\nI'm rather fond of limericks because they are fairly informal and often funny. Also tankas consist of a 5-7-5 portion and then a 7-7 portion which is of a different tone or subject, so they are almost made for telling stories with setting in the first part and then resolution. Tankas, like the similar form haikus don't usually rhyme. Cinquains are rigidly structured but don't rhyme and are meant for describing things. Sonnets are altogether hard.",
