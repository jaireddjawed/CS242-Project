I'm ending things tonight as I go to bed. None of this life is worth it anymore, and I'm just feeling so alone living in an area I'm new to and moved to for work, can't crack the code in making new friends since everyone around here seems settled into their lives with no interest in making genuine new friends beyond their college friends, and everyone is partnered up by the age of 30. I feel like I'm doomed to be a perpetual stranger.\n\nAtop of it, I've been doing this whole trying to date thing and relying on apps to do so for the past two years (longer than that, technically...) because options in real life aren't there, and when I look at how much energy and time I've exerted into it, constantly finessing my approach and my profiles, and trying different apps while sticking it out with the ones that have worked, I'm not seeing the success everyone else here puffs their chests about. I use the term \"worked\" loosely, too, since I get a few new matches each week steadily, but I also get left on read all that much as well, which is taking it's mental toll on me considering I've been on Hinge for example since last September after taking a break from it, and haven't even gotten a single in-person date out of it despite (I've gotten video dates and phone calls, however.) My conversation skill set isn't the problem. It's not the fact that I'm being too eager to ask someone out nor is it the fact that I'm waiting too long to ask someone out. It really feels like all these matches just want the attention during the work week, but when it comes time to turn the conversation into a real in-person thing, they flake. \n\nI am tired of running into the person who just got out of a serious relationship and has no idea what she wants. I am tired of running into the person who has all of the qualities I could want in a person, but lives an hour away and for that reason, doesn't take me seriously. I am tired of running into the person who has all of the qualities I could want in a person, but is in a relationship with her career and doesn't make time to date. I am tired of the secret anti-vaxxers or the secret conservatives who don't bring any of that up until you basically pull it out of them prior to almost meeting. I am tired of the matches who say things like, \"Sorry, this app is overwhelming and I get so many matches and messages that it's hard to keep up.\" I am tired of the matches who talk to you more like a friendzoned guy by bringing up their exes or even their friends with benefits. I am tired of going on dates with women who tell you they're looking for a partner and relationship only to get swerved with the news that they actually want to try out being in the ethically non-monogamous lifestyle with more than one partner. I'm tired of setting up plans only for matches to cancel them an hour beforehand. I'm tired of dodging bullets.\n\nAbove all, I'm in the best and happiest place I have ever been with my career thus far, and I continue to be in the best shape of my life. And yet, I feel so alone and like beyond work and my safe space at the gym, there's no life for me out there in the world.\n\nSo I'm leaving it.","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1678676064.0},{"title":"How typically do you release your grain, and do you think about whether you should do it before or after praying?","author":"dry_shaving","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/11qblm3\/how_typically_do_you_release_your_grain_and_do\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678718585.0},{"title":"I'm moving to a belief.","author":"dry_shaving","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/11qbakv\/im_moving_to_a_belief\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678717850.0},{"title":"A moment of great fright after Friday prayers","author":"LargeChickenTalon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/11ppg2f\/a_moment_of_great_fright_after_friday_prayers\/","text":"My fellow brothers and sisters of the Iron Temple,\n\nIt\u2019s been approximately one fortnight since I began making use of my home temple once again, after being spellbound by Broki and his minions to a sedentary existence for at least 20 winters. I rest on the days of Mercury, Saturn, and the Sun. \n\nOn my most recent day devoted to strengthening the lower limbs, I prayed for my quads until I could barely do so, utilizing dumbbell reverse lunges with two 15 lb dumbbells in three sets of five repetitions, resting five minutes in between.\n\nApproximately 60 minutes after prayers, my romantic partner made a humorous remark that drew laughter out of me. As I prostrated and bent my knees, my legs completely failed and I fell to the ground. My lower appendages were completely unusable, therefore I was unable to stand without the hand of my partner and the foot of my bed. Remain standing, I could, as long as I refrained from sitting or squatting.\n\nBrothers and sisters, forgive mine ignorance. I am determined to pray to Brodin with enough intensity to make sacred gains. Be that as it may, would Brodin frown upon such intensity from a man who\u2019s survived 39 winters and has not prayed in an Iron Temple since the 2,000 and 2nd recorded cycle around the Sun?\n\nThis was the first time my legs gave out as they did since revisiting prayers, and must admit it was frightening to the point that I devolved into state of panic for the first time in about nine lunar cycles. \u2018Twas also a disheartening revelation that my days of youth are now behind me, and I may not progress as swiftly as I\u2019d hoped.\n\nAny guidance or similar testimonials would be greatly appreciated.

I find myself perplexed. I began my journey about a year ago. Yeah, was I frail-fat and not battle ready. Having had enough of my own mediocrity and weakness, I prayed forgiveness of Brodin (and myself) and dedicated myself to worship in the Iron Temple. I've made much progress and I can hold my head high as I feel more like what a man SHOULD be. I find that I have more energy, more stamina, more \"vigor\", more muscle, more confidence, and in all things just \"better\". However, as i make this journey, my SO is growing bitter and scornful saying how she doesn't like guys \"with muscles\". I'm about 190 at 5'11\", so no, brothers and sisters, I'm no Dorian Yates and told her it isn't my goal to be that big. I perform my worship in the mornings while she's away at work, so I'm not overlong in the Temple. Now, I've told her that I'm making this journey for myself and because it makes me feel better, but she insists I should take how she feels into account and cease my worship. This pains me and sounds very unreasonable? Why would a woman want a man who isn't strong and healthy? To be clear, O my Brothers and Sisters, by the Roots of the Great Tree, under no circumstance will I cease or desist in my worship. Has anyone else encountered this?

I shooed away all the food goblins, I traded away all that weight like a sly sneaky fox. In last 10 months I went down to 280lbs.\n\nBut!

I never got the poisonous DOMS, never had issues sitting down to send filthy little Broki\u2019s into the city\u2019s web of pipes. I have only been misguided by Broki to only focus on cardio two months ago.

She said that I was born with a \"small frame\" and wasn't meant to lift heavy things.  She said that one day I would break my body while lifting and that her colleagues had seen cases where men lifting weights had broke their hip.  I tried to explain to her that those people were most likely ego lifters with bad form and that she was only seeing the 1\/1000 of cases of men lifting and getting terribly injured and having confirmation bias with those stats (she was only hearing and seeing the men getting hurt due to her profession), while I am a 31 year old man that has been working out on and off for 10+ years and have worked on safety and form all that while.

If thou hath a little more time, thy can use myoreps for accessories on a third lift, as they make for great gains in short work time.  \n\n\n**Case two**: Thou hath little time, and no access to the sacred Iron house.  \nFear not! Calisthenics are thy friend, and the world is thy gym! At any occasion thou hath of lifting a heavy object, do so. Any time thy findeth thyself with a few minutes, exercises such as the chair, the hindu pushup, the pistol squat, and all sorts of ways to pull yourself up to a bar, beam or branch can all be done in instants, and if performed with enough frequency and volume, thou shalt maintain thy gains.\n\nPerhaps thou may also be priviledged enough to posess one heavy bell in the shape of a kettle, or bands of the resistive kind, and these shall increase your possibilities. I, for one, will carry around both of them in my mechanical horse cart and havresack as I leave to visit family during the Yuletide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo remind yourself, that simply although thou may not pray as much as thou would find solace in, that the foods you eat should still be in the quantities that keep you swole, but not such that they make thy become adipose. No aliment is evil, only the quantity makes the poison.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow go my brethen, and stay swole with all your might so that your full return to the Iron Temple be glorious and all celebrate the gains thou hath kept!","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1670083160.0},{"title":"Are there any testosterone-boosting supplements?","author":"Impossible-Swing-426","url":"\/r\/automealplanner\/comments\/z8e9m8\/are_there_any_testosteroneboosting_supplements\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1670077417.0},{"title":"\"Means you've got the strength of a god no matter what, lad.

Not physically but emotionally...\n\n I am 23 years old (natural) and I tore my pec bench pressing 255 for some reps about a month ago. I felt the sudden pop, and had a big divet and swelling in my pec. It for some reason didn\u2019t even really hurt, it just felt weird. No bruising either. My range of motion was limited, but I could still move my arm in all directions. I went to an orthopedic surgeon that does shoulders for sport injuries, and right off the bat his PA thought that since it was just a \u201cpartial tear\u201d it couldn\u2019t be operated on. I didn\u2019t have an MRI at this point, but from what he saw and felt he thought it was a tear in the muscle or at the myotendenous junction. I eventually went to get an MRI of my chest\/shoulder, and the surgeon looked at it and said the same. The surgeon and the PA said they believe that with PT, my pec should be back to what it was functionally, but it will always have a divet\/deformity forever. I got a second opinion, and at first the surgeon thought surgery could be possible, as he thought that actually a portion of the tendon was detached. He said the surgery would be mostly cosmetic, and might not even do much functionally. He also felt it would return to 90-95% of its original strength without surgery. He had me get a more shoulder focused MRI, but at our second appointment, he felt that it might actually be a tear at the myotendenous junction, and cannot be operated on. Both the surgeons\u2019 opinions were that:\n\n\\- It cannot be operated on\n\n\\- It\u2019s a tear at the myotendenous junction\n\n\\- It will go back to full or nearly full strength, as the remaining portions of my Pec hypertrophy and compensate for what was torn.\n\nIts been about a month since the injury. It doesn\u2019t really hurt any more, and in day to day life I can move it completely normally. I am back to being able to open doors, turn my steering wheel, and stuff like that. I haven\u2019t started PT yet, but I have been doing some super light pressing with bands, and some easy stretching. I have almost full mobility, and so far while I know its weak, I cant say it feels extremely noticeably weaker. Of course I still haven\u2019t tried any kind of bench press or moving actual weight, so I have no idea what it can do at this point. There is about a 3 inch wide, \u00bc deep divet in my right pec kind of where it runs into my shoulder\/front delt. The muscle in that spot feels a lot thinner, and theres a tough lump, and bunching of the muscle that must have torn off, next to the divet, towards my nipple.\n\nI\u2019m probably freaking out, but it deeply bothers me, the idea of having a weaker arm. I hate the way it looks, I hate the way it feels, and I just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible that it\u2019ll go back to how it was. I feel like the surgeons, even though they are sport surgeons, aren\u2019t really considering what I consider \u201cfunctional\u201d. I am not a professional athlete or anything, but I have been lifting weights very regularly for the past 11 years, and have been getting into BJJ and Muay Thai. Bench press is my favorite lift, I don\u2019t max often, but I did 315 about a year ago. I am very proud of my pecs, and just all that I\u2019ve been able to do with my body and my active hobbies and stuff. I really want to be able to go back to all that, and give myself the best chance at that. I would be devastated if I had a lifelong deficiency in one arm, or if I was really at a higher risk of another tear, or just general weakness in a muscle like my pec. I know that it\u2019s already torn, and itll always be a bit problematic, but I was really hoping to be able to get a surgery if it means even the slightest chance at improving outcomes. I know that surgery is a big deal, and would put me out a while, but this is a lifelong decision. It also feels like, if they go in with surgery, I would feel more comfortable knowing it was \u201cset\u201d back in place, and manually repaired, even if that doesn\u2019t actually make a difference. Also I can\u2019t help but really be bothered by how it looks. They keep saying that it\u2019ll go back to how it was functionally without surgery, but how could that possibly be true, if I am now missing a 3 inch wide \u00bc inch deep slab of muscle off my pec? I know that your body can grow and adapt, but It just really bothers me, the idea of having less muscle, or less function of that pec, and that what is left over will have to compensate for what is lost. I worked so hard for that muscle, and to just lose it in a second, the idea of that kills me. \n\nI feel like the surgeons are not taking my concerns very seriously, or are convinced that it would be enough for someone with less athletic demands\/emphasis on performance as me. I also found this surgeon (https:\/\/youtu.be\/eusX0jfgmOw) who has a YouTube channel, that claims that often pec tears are misdiagnosed as being \u201cmyotendenous junction\u201d tears, and that many surgeons will say they can\u2019t be fixed, but really they can. I also know that Pec tears are not a common injury, and that some surgeons may be more hesitant or less versed in the injury than others. Also lately, in my city (Portland OR), it\u2019s generally just been super hard to get appointments with doctors. I would be very sad if I had to live with this lifelong deformity\/weakness, because I couldn\u2019t get enough appointments when I was 23. I know that for a while I\u2019ll be backing off bench, and focusing on maybe shoulders, leg, and back, but at some point I want to be able to get back to it. Every time I see or feel the divet, I want to cry, it really makes me miserable. \n\nhas anyone had this type of injury before? what did you do?","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1658790716.0},{"title":"Mine brothers in iron, am I the only one??","author":"ThedreadedT","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/w7wses\/mine_brothers_in_iron_am_i_the_only_one\/","text":"I partake occasionally in the viewing of lifting videos, to prepare the mind and ready myself to send prayers to Brodin.

One of the most known things about our lifestyles in this modern age is that a lot of people are under stress; with work deadlines, busy social lives, and even more demanding family lives, your body creates tension and the stress hormone, cortisol. Cortisol is known to contribute to the lack of sleep, weight gain, digestive issues, and headaches. Massage therapy is known to reduce these levels of cortisol within the body, therefore contributing to the improvement of relaxation, improving mood, and reducing level of stress in the body. As well as reducing these stress levels, regular massages can assist overall physical and mental well-being.\n\nAn aromatherapy massage is a Swedish massage therapy used for a variety of different health reasons. This therapy uses essential oils for massage. The therapist diffuses this oil in the room or adds a few drops of oil to massage lotion and applies it directly to your skin. Its purpose is to improve physical and mental health. As the oils are highly concentrated, they must be diluted with another carrier oil or lotions. Some studies say that these oils help improve mood and alleviate anxiety and stress. You can talk with your therapist to decide which oils are best, safe, and suitable for you to use. Your therapist will recommend specific essential oils based on your needs.","upvote_ratio":0.15,"created_utc":1655472179.0},{"title":"Swoldiers of Massguard, what must be done to enter Swolehalla?","author":"swehttamxam","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/vacott\/swoldiers_of_massguard_what_must_be_done_to_enter\/","text":"I have cut from 250 to 230, in a moon 220, then to 212.

However, when I awoke this morn I did feel some aching in my back. The pain felt to be of sore muscles and not that of the joints in mine spine. So I come to you humbly to ask, is this normal?

(Oblique abs) Floor side crunches with weight held high above head - did these for awhile but find linear progression difficult as I can't easily add weight increments, and it's hard to hold a heavy weight above my head.\n4. (Oblique abs) Side hanging leg raises - Just tried these. I can hold a dumbbell between my knees, making linear progression possible. However, I find my grip strength failing at about the same time as my abs! Ideally I would be isolating my abs without grip strength being a factor.\n5. (Lower abs) Currently doing: Floor leg raises + 'flutter kicks' + jack-knife, 3 sets of 12 reps + 12 reps + 12 reps. The issue here is the relatively high rep range (36 reps), and lack of linear progression. I can buy 3kg ankle weights, but if I want to progress, I'd have to buy multiple sets of ankle weights.\n\nBasically\n\n* How best to train all ab (upper, lower, obliques) with linear progression?

Over the course of millions of years, iron and stone together crushed, bent, cracked, split, mixed, melted, melded, and hardened into something malleable.  With the help of the wind, this malleable substance found its home in a deep canyon resembling a human.  It layed there dormant for some time until a great flood blanketed over it. What rose from the deep depths of the canyon was both a miracle and a blessing.  In its watery baptism, our Savior, Lord Broseidon emerged.  This spectacle of a being was chiseled on the outside like rough rock, but his movements were fluid like the waters that birth him.  He pushed and pulled land and water until he was satisfied with his work which ultimately shaped the world we know it today.  His pushing and pulling of large, heavy things made him happy.  He then wanted to spread this newfound love by making smaller, less powerful versions of him to spread the joy of lifting to all people.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1645938281.0},{"title":"Exhausted, spent and just fucking done with everything.

His muscles were small of stature and his form was lacking. His frail arms trembled as they performed agonisingly slow reps of the lightest weights. Some who witnessed his prayers were even afraid for the old man, as they feared he might hurt himself in his exertions. Yet he would simply smile at any who approached, and assure them that he was fine and knew what he was doing. \n\nAfter a while, a strong man entered the temple. He had been lifting for many years, and his muscles were large and his person swole. As he took up the squat rack he noticed the old man in the rack next to him. He glanced once at the old disciple of iron and let out a chuckle under his breath, internally judging the old man as weak and frail. The man proceeded to load the bar with weight and start his prayers of squat.\n\nHeavier and heavier he loaded the bar. But every time he went to collect more plates, he seemed to some way or another cross path with the old man. Once he had to wait for the old man to collect some 5kg plates. Painstakingly slow the old man lifted the tiny plates off the weight rack, and the strong man felt himself grow impatient, tapping his foot and loudly letting out disapproving groans.\n\nAnother time they both turned to walk to the weight rack at the same time, and almost collided. \"Watch where you're going\" the strong man bellowed, shouting over the loud music that came blaring out of his earphones. \n\nA third time the man found himself needing some plates that were lying by the old mans rack. \"Do you need these?\" he asked, collecting the plates before the old man seemed to even register the question. \n\nThe temple was busy that day, and as no other rack was unoccupied a fellow worshipper approached the man to ask if he could work in between the sets. But the man replied \"I'm soon finished, you can get the rack after me.\" But in truth he knew he had many sets yet to go. The old man spoke then: \"You can work in with me\".\n\nAfter a while, the man had finally reached his working weight. After busting out his last set he finished his workout feeling proud and strong. He left the barbell there, and what plates that were not on the barbell he lazily slid on a random pegs in the plate rack, without giving it a second thought. On his way out of the gym he realised he had forgot his water bottle by the squat rack, and he turned around to retrieve it.\n\nWhat he witnessed made him momentarily doubt his own eyes. The frail old man that had been praying beside him was unracking the barbell, still loaded from the mans prayers. Not only that, but he was doing it seemingly without effort. \n\nEasily the old man held the barbell in the front rack position, and while doing so wandered over to the plate rack. He then let go of the barbell with one hand, and started removing the plates the strong man had put in the incorrect places and moved them to the correct ones. Then he started removing the plates of the barbell he was still holding, placing them in where the labels matched the weight of each plate. Once the barbell was empty he returned it to the rack, and continued on working out in the manner he was before.\n\nThe strong young man remembered then the tales that were told of Brodin. That he can take many forms, and that he walks among us in our places of worship to observe and judge the worthy. He approached then the old man and spoke proudly:\n\n\"Hail Brodin! I am one of your devout followers. I have walked the iron path for many years, and have honoured you with heavy lifts. Did you witnessed how I honoured you today, oh great Allspotter?\"\n\nThe old man turned to stare at him then, and the strong man could feel his gaze penetrate him. He seemed to shrink as he met his old eyes, and even as he stood there the old man seemed now to appear larger and stronger than before. The old man then spoke: \"It is true, I am indeed Brodin. And I have witnessed your prayers this day. Yet you do not honour me.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" the young man replied. He felt himself suddenly unsure before the Allspotter, feeling his judgement weigh upon him like a heavy barbell. \"I busted out heavy sets today, in good form and with heavier weight than any other here in the temple. How can you not recognise my worship?\"\n\nBrodin looked upon the man then and spoke: \"You claim to honour me and follow the iron path, yet all I have witnessed you do today is lift heavy weights. You are strong of muscles, but that does not make you strong in the way of iron. You poison the air of my temple with loud music from your earphones, forcing your music on those that would not wish to hear it. You disrespect your fellow worshipper both in thought and in action. Three times did you disrespect me as a fellow worshipper today. You refuse to share your rack even as you know the temple is full. Is this how you yourself would want to be treated? And is it not said that to disrespect my temple is to disrespect me? You leave the bar with all your plates on, and what little you do to clean after yourself you do in a lazy fashion, not following the clear markings carved on the rack. Hear my words and know them to be true. You are an ego lifter, lifting for yourself only. You may be strong of muscle, but you are weak of heart and mind. This is not the iron whey. I judge you unworthy.\"\n\nThe man felt even smaller now, and could barely look Brodin in the eyes. He resisted the urge to flee, but heard then the Allspotters command:\n\n\"Be gone from here. Leave my temple, and do not return until you can lift without ego, but with honour and humility.\"\n\nThe man ran away then, feeling shameful and crushed. But deep down he knew the the truth in the Allspotters words.\n\nFrom that day on, he took extra care to help out his fellow worshippers where he could. He would leave the equipment as he would want to find it; with the plates at their correct place and barbell unloaded. Not only in the temple did\n\nhe act with respect and empathy, but also outside in his daily life. Where he before would be angry he would now react with understanding as best he could. Where he before was apathetic to foul deeds of others, thinking it was someone else's problem, he now made an effort to contribute where and what he could, needing no other reward than the greater good. After many moons he could finally again say \"I walk the iron whey\", knowing this time it rang true.\n\nSuch is but one of the legends of Brodin the Allspotter. Be always mindful of your temple and respectful of your neighbours, for he walks among us and judges us both inside and outside our temples.\n\nWheymen","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1645546791.0},{"title":"Protein intake","author":"InsidePressure4671","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/sx2dle\/protein_intake\/","text":"\n\nWhy do some people for exmaple John Meadows (RIP) and IFBB pros say to eat 40% of ur calories as protein ( roughly 1.5 grams per pound of body weight) but lots of others like Reinsance periodization and Jeff Nippard say that 1 gram of protein per pound of body is more than enough (20-30% of total calories)?","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1645367190.0},{"title":"I am but a man in the face of Broki","author":"TheHerpsMaster","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/svxbk4\/i_am_but_a_man_in_the_face_of_broki\/","text":"Brothers and Sisters, this Tiersday I performed many a mighty lift in Brodin\u2019s honor.

We exchanged numbers, texted and shared more photos. We brought up meeting and plans. She lives an hour away, which isn't the most ideal consideration the direction she lives in is more traffic-laden. She also works an atypical schedule (only days off are Sundays and Wednesdays, and gets home later in the evening vs. my weekends off.) I offered to meet up tomorrow, but she said there's a 40% chance of snow, and she doesn't drive in the snow because she's originally from Brazil. I offered up doing a video call as a happy medium instead of either of us efforting the drive, and she said she doesn't think video calls are the same as a date.\n\nAt this point, I began to question in my head how flexible she was willing to be. She also mentioned wanting to meet for dinner or at a bar, and I told her that right now, due to COVID rates in the area plus it being Superbowl and Valentine's Day weekend, I'm still not comfortable meeting in more crowded spaces. I told her an outdoor activity, getting a coffee in a space where there's more room, a video call, or even hanging out at one of our places if comfortable if we did a video or phone call would be welcome. I told her I don't mind something like a museum where people wear masks is okay, too. She wasn't receptive to any of them.\n\nShe then said whenever I felt comfortable we could meet, but also asked what I even do, which honestly rubbed me the wrong way because it's not like I was not offering safe solutions for the current time to meet. I felt I was trying to be flexible as well. She sent me a few voice memos, and I'm not sure if it's due to her being Brazilian, but she seemed kind of condescending in tone in stating that it felt like I was making meeting too complicated. On my end, I don't think I'm the one being all that complicated since I'm bringing options to the table and she's just rejecting them because they don't fit into the standard bucket of meeting for dinner in person, and what sounds like me having to drive her way at her convenience of her days off to meet rather than meeting halfway.\n\nI haven't yet written this one off as something that probably is not going to work due to conflicting perspectives in something as simple as arranging a first date, but partially think the fact that she's an attractive woman with a natural Brazilian booty and bust that would make Brodin blush is clouding my reason.

I felt like Sisyphus in a way, always attempting to ameliorate mineself, but thwarted by executive dysfunction: mine efforts were without results, but took up time and energy.

At the time it was just a hobby project I worked on during the pandemic so my buddies and I could log our workout progress in a way that was tailor-made to suit our gym-rat needs. Basically: intuitive graphs, easy interface, logging RPE\/RIR, customizable, no ads\/subscriptions, etc. Fast forwarding to recently, I was happily surprised that the app turned out be quite helpful for others here in the reddit community as well!\n\nSince then, I've been implementing lots of the feedback I received from the community and wanted to share this progress with you all in case you would also find the app useful for your workout tracking. The app is free to use \/ has no subscriptions \/ etc and no ads and I intend to keep it that way :)\n\n**Here are the current main features of the app:**\n\n\\- Design your own custom workout routines for different types of exercises (weight & time, weight, time, distance & time, etc.)- Create workout plans (plan workout sets ahead & add supersets).- Activate workout-mode when you enter the gym. This tracks your progress live while you workout with real-time graphs and statistics to visualize your progress.- Tons of statistics and different graphs to visualize your progress.- Add notes to your workouts and logs.- See suggestions for your next personal record while logging sets for an exercise.- Create goals for exercises.- Rest timer.- Log Rated Perceived Exertion (RPE) and Reps in Reserve (RIR).- Calendar and list of your previous workouts.- Track custom body metrics like weight, BMI, arm\/leg size, etc.- Supports both metric and imperial units.- And much more :)\n\nNote the app is web-based and thus requires an internet connection to work (because I'm a web developer and was tired of losing my workout data whenever I formatted or lost my phone). It's currently available on the Play Store and the web:\n\n**Play Store:** [https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=app.myworkinprogress.twa](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=app.myworkinprogress.twa)\n\n**Web App:** [https:\/\/myworkinprogress.app\/](https:\/\/myworkinprogress.app\/)\n\nSome things I'm working on next:\n\n\\- Ability to export your data as a CSV, excel file.- iOS support (long term). For now you can use the Web App and Add it your homescreen. It'll be installed as a Progressive Web App :D.- Making creating routines\/exercises more detailed (for example-- setting what % of a muscle you use for an exercise to get even more stats on a workout-- like for example which muscle you hit the most during a workout).\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions. You can also submit feedback via the app directly. I really love to get feedback as it gives me ideas for new features I never thought of before that even end up being very useful for me during my workouts :)\n\n*Disclaimer: I do not profit from the usage of this app. There is a donation feature which is completely voluntary and uninstrusive that just goes towards server costs. I just built it out of my own need and to improve my programming skills, and sharing it as it may also be useful for others.*","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1635876251.0},{"title":"2 Quick Questions (Muscle asymmetry, and am I working all major muscle groups with these machines for a good physique?)","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/qkyoct\/2_quick_questions_muscle_asymmetry_and_am_i\/","text":"So I am very new to going to the gym.

Never again will I lose focus.  The people you date come and go but the Iron Family is here to stay.  When you struggle they leave, the tingles of a new relationship don\u2019t last forever.  You get love bombed and let them into your house, your life and family and then leave.  \n\nNever lose focus brothers and sisters. While the person you date may never be honest with you, the iron always lets you know where you stand.  It never lies, it tests you and humbles you.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1634650240.0},{"title":"I have joined the brotherhood of a thousand pounds","author":"MontyHallsGoatthrowa","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/qb00ta\/i_have_joined_the_brotherhood_of_a_thousand_pounds\/","text":"Hail and well met, brothers and sisters in iron. I have lurked this subreddit for years, while mine flesh was soft and ample. Not four moons ago I began traveling the iron path. Just yesterday my lifts in Brodin's three swoliest lifts totalled 1000 pounds. \n\nMy flesh is still ample, but not so soft, and I look forward to more gains to come.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1634603944.0},{"title":"Big unmasculine butt, what steps should i take to fix that?","author":"nimbo94","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/qbnblm\/big_unmasculine_butt_what_steps_should_i_take_to\/","text":"Any workouts that should try? \n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/S0uTCYS","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1634684586.0},{"title":"Brothers and Sisters, I return with an apology","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/qap9my\/brothers_and_sisters_i_return_with_an_apology\/","text":"Swoldiers, I used to be a most devoted priest of the iron church. I prayed 6 times per week. Alas, with the pandemic also came monsters far more sinister - excuses. \n\nI come to make amends for my lack of prayer. At this stage I had not prayed for an entire solar orbit. \n\nI returned to walk the path but 3 nights ago upon constructing a most modest home church.\n\nBrothers, Sisters, I come to atone for my sins and return to the holiest of ways.\n\nAmen.\n\nEdit: I see now that the Allspotter cares not about the stray from the path, but the return to it. Brothers and Sisters, I thank thee for welcoming me back to the light. A thousand reps I pledge in thanks.\n\nWheymen.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1634571782.0},{"title":"Brodin hath opened my eyes and I am born anew","author":"grahch","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/swoleacceptance\/comments\/q9os72\/brodin_hath_opened_my_eyes_and_i_am_born_anew\/","text":"I started a lifting-heavy fitness program four weeks ago that's changed my life. I've starting noticing weight loss for the first time in my life, I feel myself getting stronger, and I no longer see other disciples of Brodin as strangers or enemies, but as brothers instead. No longer does Broki have his hold over me.\n\nI've been overweight my whole life. This is the first time I've seen myself achieving a physical fitness goal with such visible results. I feel so motivated to keep accomplishing challenging sets and I am amazed at seeing how quickly my body is acclimating to heavier weights in what feels like a short amount of time. I've lurked in this sub for a long time and I'm excited to finally feel like I can belong here. Sk\u00e5l!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1634433205.0}]
