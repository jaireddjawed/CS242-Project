There does seem to be news around various ways that researchers have discovered to [efficiently destroy PFAS](https://www.vice.com/en/article/akep8j/scientists-destroyed-95-of-toxic-forever-chemicals-in-just-45-minutes-study-reports), but that just makes me wonder when the governments of the world are going to force manufacturers to pay for remediation efforts needed to clean up the mess they made.
