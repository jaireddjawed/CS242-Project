        "text": "I'm 26, currently working as in-house tech support at a company. I've been working tech support for 6 years total, half of which was part-time work while I was in college. Recently, I've felt a pang of dread about what I'm going to do in the future. I eventually narrowed the cause down to not setting concrete goals for myself and really asking myself what I wanted to accomplish. I was (less so now) the kind of person who thought goal setting was something that people do when they want to show off in front of others. I never really took it seriously. Now, I'm realizing that once you're out of school, you have to make your own objectives and goals, or you can get stuck doing the same thing day after day without any feeling of progress and that's dragging me down hard. So, I've set my sights on a few goals. However, I have found that I consistently put off working towards those goals by filling my time with video games. The time I spent on that alone would've put me in a much better place if I had dedicated even half of that time to different goals over the past few years. I know it's important to have an outlet to relax, but how do you personally manage hobbies/habits that derail progress toward your goals?",

        "text": "I‚Äôm feeling surprisingly good! Ofcourse I‚Äôm still hurt about the break up, but I filled my whole day with positive vibes and motivational podcasts to feel better and it worked!\n\nI started the day with a phone call with school. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck and I‚Äôm not moving forward‚Ä¶ This is because I‚Äôm scared to fail, I want to do everything perfect and I can‚Äôt risk failing. But I don‚Äôt know why, because at the same time I know that with failure comes learning. And you only grow if you learn! I heard a quote today that said: ‚ÄúIf you want to get comfortable, you need to do uncomfortable things‚Äù. I love this one!\n\nFrom 11:00 till 16:00 I cleaned at my grandparents house. Only listening to up beat music and motivational podcasts. I also told the rest of my family and friends that met and my (ex)boyfriend broke up. That also lifted a weight of my shoulders. \n\nAfter cleaning, I actually packed all his last stuff for him to pick up later. I‚Äôm surprised that I could do that so easily! I said a few affirmations in the mirror because I felt really strong at that point. \n\nI made myself some food and decided to take a long walk to get to my 10.000 steps. Again with only up beat music. My (ex)boyfriend texted me to get his stuff and I told him that I would be with him in about 25 minutes. We talked a little and I could see that he was emotional, which is normal, I was too but I didn‚Äôt want to show him that too much. I told him that I was proud of him and that I would always love him. We said our goodbyes and we would see each other tomorrow.\n\nAt 20:00 I went to get my one hour workout done and now I‚Äôm eating my dinner. I‚Äôll shower after and then I‚Äôll get some sleep in my lonely empty bed. It gets better, I know that. But I miss him..\n\nI can‚Äôt place all my updates here so I‚Äôll do that here: r/becomemybestself",

Right now I‚Äôm making a list of things that I would like to improve but because of my ADHD I often write down tasks that are way too big. So I‚Äôm trying to make the list a bit more accessible for myself. Instead of writing down one big task, I wrote down multiple smaller ones. For example instead of ‚ÄòI want to improve my looks‚Äô I write down ‚Äògo to the hairdresser‚Äô and ‚Äòfinding a pair of jeans I really like‚Äô. I want to do this for many aspects of my life. So not only physical appearance but also creating good habits, things for school, cleaning and tidying my house and other things that will improve my life and how I feel about myself and my life.\n\nSo my question is, do any of you have similar lists? And if not do you have something that I can add onto mine?\n\nIt would help me a lot üòä",

        "text": "I want to caveat this post by saying I'm not making this post for likes, I'm purely making it to pay it forward so it might help unlock someone else's potential. Anyone can do this the method I used makes it pretty easy. I struggled with beliefs that I was lazy for years but in reality we're all very driven and motivated when we cut out all the distractions. And if you want to criticise and be negative, each to his own, but it won't get you anywhere.\n\nI've tried everything to become more disciplined get more done etc.\n\nI always felt like I was driving with the handbrake on though.\n\nWith the development of tech over the last few years my addiction to YouTube content political drama had become a solid background habit.\n\nOver the last year I identified these things as the enemies that absolutely had to go if I was ever going to be free.\n\n1) Football 2) YouTube 3) Endless podcasts (their not productive) 4) Googling absolutely every question my mind can think of. 5) Instagram 6) Twitter (it's 95% unproductive) 7) instant messaging with no purpose 8) gossipping, complaining 9) obsessing over how I look. 10) Reading and researching how to be healthier (this one is perhaps the most deceptive of all because it's kind of good for you) 11) Junk food 12) Sugar 13)Porn 14) reading comments or commenting on anything online\n\nThose are the main ones.\n\nI'm currently on day 31 of 100% detox, which in reality is more like 90% - 97% and it's goin well.\n\nThis is a short and sweet post with some general outlines of how I did it incase you want to do the same.\n\n1 identify your vices, understand you must let them go to get what you want.\n\n2 Learn about instant Vs delayed gratification\n\n3 Learn about dopamine and addiction in general, learn about the negative side of whatever your addicted to deprogram your mind from the addictive idealisation of your vice.\n\n4 set a period of time about 2 weeks for deprogramming, learning about all the things above through YouTube and blogs and books. During this time your also detoxing from the vices.\n\n5 after this period go into a 40 day 100% detox. Cut out the videos and blogs. During this period you'll relapse a little you'll get sucked back in a bit. You'll have good and bad days.\n\n6 The key during this period is to give yourself something to focus on for delayed gratification. I use an app called my daily planner where I plan out my day and fill it with good stuff like meditation, working out, lots of work, reading learning all the delayed gratification things you never could be bothered to do.\n\nThat's pretty much where I am now, you'll still struggle to do things and be lazy at times but you'll start to enjoy pushing yourself into hard things. And ticking each task of that daily planner will become your new dopamine high.\n\nThat's a rough outline, there are many more steps and tools I ok implemented though.\n\nMessage me if you want some advice because as you see in number 14 looking at likes on comments is an addictive loop I don't do anymore.\n\nPeace",

        "text": "Not at all. Obviously, it won't.\n\nYou won't just appear in the morning as a successful supersoldier.\n\nYou must begin making ostensibly small changes right away and then build on them every day or every week.\n\nTake baby steps in the right direction because our bodies and minds dislike any kind of drastic change.\n\nNot three hours earlier, but 15 minutes earlier.\n\nTake warm showers for the first three-quarters of them, then turn the temperature down so you don't end up skipping or taking incredibly brief showers because that's just unsanitary.\n\nInstead of working out every day, try to do so one extra day a week.\n\nInstead of blocking all of your favorite distraction websites, start browsing the internet a little less frequently than usual.\n\nDon't just empty the contents of your fridge and restock it with organic food; instead, add some steamed vegetables to your dinner and drink a little more water than usual.\n\nInstead of expecting to finish a chapter of a book, read a few pages.\n\nDon't just change your persona overnight; start with one challenging conversation you've been putting off, and move forward from there.\n\nWhen it is appropriate, make eye contact and start a conversation with the person you are attracted to. Don't try to get rejected 10 times a day so you become immune to it, or whatever the literature suggests.\n\nInstead of practicing total abstinence, reduce your masturbation to once or twice per week (or thereabouts), but only when you're in the mood.\n\nRecognize every step forward, no matter how small. No matter how severe, accept failures.\n\nIt might work for a few hours or even days to expect to completely change your way of life because you recently read \"you can't hurt me\" or listened to a jocko willink podcast, but eventually the change will seem too drastic, and you'll revert back to your old routines.\n\nThis may appear lazy and counterproductive, but the key to making changes that stick is to learn how to reward yourself. Recent neuroscientific research further supports the idea that this ability is essential for someone to achieve challenging long-term goals.\n\nToday was my last day of dissolution before I picked myself up by the bootstraps and started getting disciplined because for far too many years I thought that my ultra-disciplined alter ego was just around the corner.\n\nI didn't fully understand this was a justification for not acting until much later.\n\nstart right away.\n\nYou'll eventually arrive.",

        "text": "So, the point is that I have zero hobbies now. For context, I've recently just came out of weird friendship with one of my classmates, where I would fill gaps in my free time with thinking of him and how \"cool\" he is. Now, when I think of him less or only think negatively, I clearly started to see that I've been stagnating all this time and had no hobbies, and still have none. And it makes me feel awful.  \n\n\nI don't want to do things that this guy does.  Even though the things he is passionate about or just make him feel furfilled interest me, I just wanna develop \\*my own ones\\*. But every time I tried to develop hobbies before, it didn't come out very good. I didn't feel any furfillment after some time. All I felt is a desire to be perfect in this hobby and plan every single detail out. Like if it was my carrier, not what makes me interested and makes my days brighter.\n\nFor example, I tried crochet before. At first, I was VERY passionate about it. I would spend hours trying to make the most basic stitches, even if i was dreadful in it. I did it anyway because I loved it. But later, when i learnt the basics and started to actually crochet things, I lost this passion. I focused on what is \"most useful\" to crochet, what is \"easier\" to crochet, rather than crocheting something random, that I would \\*enjoy\\* crocheting. And eventually, I gave up. I couldn't stand these chaotic thoughts about improvement in the field. Now I find no passion in this hobby.\n\nAnd it happened multiple times. Coding, language learning, reading, 3d modeling, gamedev, and so on. I gave up on all of them. And it's heartbreaking that this exact guy finds furfillment in what he does after years of doing it. He truly enjoys what he does, and it feels... unfair. I feel broken when I think about this. I tried so many things, and none got me hooked longer than a few months. I don't enjoy those things anymore.\n\nAnd again, I don't want to do things this guy does. I'm thinking like this on purpose. Because it feels like the only things I truly am passionate about are all things other people do. That I am not interested in developing my own hobbies, but taking hobbies from others. Like, where is \\*my\\* identity here then if they developed their hobbies themsefles and I developed none myself? I just want this \"me\" feeling. \\*I\\* found this hobby, \\*I\\* first discovered it. It's all so messed up...\n\nSo I wish someone could put me away of this \\*thought pit\\* and tell me practical tips. Maybe tell me that I approach the problem the wrong way. Maybe tell me and explain why I'm mistaken in something. I genuinely don't know what to do with myself.\n\nP.S. I just reread my post and realized that it's VERY chaotic, because I put here both my own thoughts about this classmate and thoughts about my hobbies. I hope people who will read this will understand what I wanted to convey, and if not, I'm free to answer any questions.",

I think with time,  that voice of self-doubt will diminish until it's almost a whisper and then I could approach a complete stranger, ask them something off the cuff and have the same emotional state as if I were ordering a coffee.\n\nIt's such as simple thing, approaching a stranger and it really is making me more confident.

I am always paranoid that people look at me and think I'm disgusting and do not shower because they would not understand that I have such condition, I am afraid that girls too find me unhygienic because of the dead skin cells buildup on my neck, its likely that this condition will stay with me all my life but im afraid how my life will move forward, it saddens me that people will likely think im unhygienic and ugly when I try my best to keep it as clean as possible, this thought also demotivates me and is taking over making me more socially awkward and nervous",

        "text": "Okay so I have this boy that I'm in love/obsessed with.  He says he likes me too (although not in the same intensity, i think he's just like \"okay sure, let's date or whatever\"). I'm fine with that. We mostly function great, but there is this one thing he does to me that makes me feel absolutely horrible and it can't be resolved by communication or in any healthy way (you'll have to trust me on that one). I'm not going to get into details because it would take time to explain and it's not relevant. I have decided that I don't want to be with him anymore because what we have is honestly not worth the pain. But I really want to keep him as a friend because that way everything would be perfect (long story, just trust me). So I have made it my goal to stop being in love with him. Through that I also want to work out a universal strategy to get me out of love in the future too, because I have that problem way too often. I get obsessed with men that are anavailable or harmful to me but I'm stuck because of my emotions so I waste my time and energy (I almost can't do anything else when I'm in love, like be productive at university or work, all I'm interested in is talking to him or fantasizing or checking his social media). It's honestly embarassing and childish (I'm 23). But I can't do anything because I am obsessed with him so it's like going against myself, like I don't really want it. But at the same time I do. It's like I'm possessed by my hormones and I hate the feeling of not having free will. I want to learn to conquer my emotions. But they make me not want to do that!! It's like a paradox! Emotional regulation is a paradox when you think about it. Okay so I need advice on how to get out of that cycle. How do I get myself motivated to work on getting out of love and then, how do I get out of love?",

        "text": "I don‚Äôt know where to start but I will try my best. Please forgive me for my grammar, english and on how I construct this message for I know that mind is in a blur. \n\nHi, I‚Äôm a  23 years old male. I just graduated recently last December 2022. I have a small business which is my passion and dream to be known and successful businessman.  My small business is in a success because I have saved a lot of money from my small business while I was a student compare to my other batch mates, they look unto me as a successful person for my age. I live in the Philippines. For that, I have also have a dream to make my country great. I‚Äôm about to go to America this summer to work there after I finish my nursing board exams. I love to work as a nurse in the coming years because it has a good pay in America compare here in the Philippines and I plan to save more there and learn more there to fulfill my dreams as a businessman. I came from a broken family. My dad and mother is divorced and I‚Äôm am there only son that means I didn‚Äôt have any siblings. I grew up with my grandmother and grandfather almost all my life. I am much closer to my grandmother since she is very supportive, caring and kind. I also have a loving girlfriend right now in a 2 year long distance relationship. She is very caring, loving and smart. The best and easy way to describe her is she gives her all to me. \n\nForgive me again for I don‚Äôt know if some of the things I said above is all necessary to say, but those are some of the things you need to know in my life to know where I‚Äôm coming from, I think most of the things there are good things that I hold into my life to motivate myself to become a better man because some of them are the things I‚Äôm very grateful for. I try to focus on then but I don‚Äôt know it seems recently this past few days, weeks and maybe almost months, I can‚Äôt tell at this point but let me try to explain again on what are the bad things that happened.\n\nBefore this events, I was mindful to my mental and physical health, I went to the gym regularly and I love running, I read some books, I also do meditation sometimes. I have a positive thinking in life in all aspects about my faith in God, about the goals in my life life, on how I can make myself healthier. I go out with friends and family to socialize. I have a lot of money to spend with everything were all good but as time goes by all of it is fading little by little. I‚Äôm getting out of shape, I started wasting my time on social media scrolling and watching than reading books. I don‚Äôt run anymore and go to the gym often. My money is still good  it‚Äôs not a problem. I don‚Äôt think of it often because I feel for my age is not to worry especially all the things happen on how I invest my money are learning curves because I‚Äôm still in early part of my life. But all the others things in my life is getting miserable.\n\n\nAll of this became more worse when my mom came home from America for my graduation. She works in a caregiving home care for the old people. She hasn‚Äôt been with me for 16 years because she was stuck in America because she was not a citizen because my dad got divorce with her that time. So when she came home here she have a behavior that you could tell she is mentally ill but sometimes she makes sense. But most of the times it‚Äôs becoming toxic on how she tells her hardships and sacrifices as a mom to me and I should be grateful. Which I am but to tell it like I owe her everything because of her miserable life that happened to her and blaming it on me and I should just listen and not talk back is very toxic. Especially she is very irresponsible in her financial decisions and recently my father always keeping telling me that I should be grateful he supported me throughout my schooling until graduation even they are just 50/50 in paying my school that I should be calling him often to ask how is he. They are all toxic like they hold the grudge on me for the things they have done which should be just an obligation as a parent. Now, I don‚Äôt know if that affects my life right now to be just stagnant because it hurts and you feel more weak when you are doing your best and trying always to look good in the things in life and they are saying i‚Äôm a spoiled irresponsible child that I should listen to them even though they are not fit to be a role model to listen to them. Now, even my grandmother i hate her now because she is tolerating her and telling me just understand her even she is not changing and it‚Äôs very toxic. My girlfriend also tried to make the situation worse because there is one time that they talk and she didn‚Äôt even try to correct my mother and even made things worse because she is like siding with her because recently I was in a bad mood always because of the previous things happened. Now she is very sorry and begging me to patch things up since I was upset that she let her emotion make things worse now she regrets it but I‚Äôm so fed up in life I just wanna break up with her and isolate myself with everyone.\n\n\nI just wanna tell that I love watching movies since I was young because I think they teach you how to develop your character especially I don‚Äôt have a father who is there to teach me things in life. Some of those movies are forrest gump, the godfather, redshank redemption, dead poet society, good will hunting etc.\n\nRecently i‚Äôve been watching the Vikings. Ragnar and Ecbert really hitting me right now on how I feel  about things like if it‚Äôs our own decision or is it fate? And many more, Vikings is really something that make me want to live as a viking because all things are corrupt in the christian world or this modern world.\n\n\nOr\n\nMaybe this is a bad karma? I‚Äôve become a playboy when I was single and to my previous girlfriend. My excuse is I‚Äôm still young and need to enjoy. I have a lot of girls who I talked with and made them fall in love with me or give them hope that I‚Äôm into them but I tried to sweet talk them and slightly I‚Äôm kinda honest that I dont want serious relationship but we can try, then they don‚Äôt know I have a lot of girls talking at the same time and when do something sexually they get attached and they will just know that I have already a girl like i have chose a girl out of all the girls i talked too. \n\n\nI‚Äôm getting tired already in sharing my life and I think some it is very irrelevant and poorly explained. Thank you if you reach here in reading because I‚Äôm in a point to delete all of it and not post or not share anymore, my mind is aching because I‚Äôm very hopeless. But I tried my best to share because I don‚Äôt know what to feel and do anymore..\n\n\nSeeing the this chaotic and cruel world is making me hopeless in what‚Äôs the point doing good things and trying to improve if life is holding you back because of the evil things you see? Is it worth it? In my thinking I have felt the highs and lows in life. What is there to see? Why can‚Äôt I feel a real family in my life? Can I still be the person I dream I was want to be if I feel I‚Äôm getting corrupted in my mind and heart? When will this suffering end? \n\nWhy is it like yesterday was bright and sunny? And suddenly, now I just wanna stop this misery in my life..\n\nI hope someone read this",

        "text": "\nHi, I'm a 20 year old engineering student, currently in my first year. I have a serious daydreaming/overthinking problem. I constantly think about my childhood and teenage days and wallow in nostalgia for hours at a stretch and because of this I'm not being able to focus either on my studies or on having fun.\n\nMy teenage wasn't eventful at all, in fact I used to spend most of my time all by myself, reading books and watching movies. I led a very safe and sheltered lifestyle (boring in other words I guess). I was weird and socially awkward and could never mix properly with other kids of my age and had only a few close friends. During the vacations, my parents used to take me to our hometown to meet cousins and relatives instead of holidaying elsewhere. I used to be close to my cousins when we were kids but now everyone's moving ahead in different directions (including me) but I still feel stuck to the past. Didn't use social media at all, and still don't know how to. To be honest, I've always felt like an old-timer and have always had a kind of generation gap with my own fricking generation.\n\nI just can't let go of the memories of those simple days and constantly keep on wishing to go back to that time when the world for me used to be innocent and uncomplicated. I know I'm looking at the past with nostalgia tinted glasses but I have no idea how to solve this problem. I just can't make my mind forget everything and look towards the future. Because of this I've become emotionally distant from everything and stay zoned out most of the time. I don't have a group of my own and keep to myself.\n\nFor me everything went downhill in 2020 because of the pandemic. Then I took a gap year, and now I'm in a tier-2 university. It's quite a decent place with tons of exposure, but I can't make use of the opportunities. I came here to start everything anew and grow and evolve as a person but i just can't run away from my own mind. Now my first year is going to end in a couple of months and I'm still aimless and wasting my time here. What should I do?",

He ran away, because of many complex reasons, and we cannot even continue to be friends. At least for a long undetermined time.\n\nSo I'm left alone and what I called \"home\" doesn't exist anymore.\n\n* What are my goals? My first goal was to go to Canada to live with him. Do I still want this? I don't know, but I guess I should at least try? Why should I stop?\n* What are my relationships? I still managed to keep contact with some friends, even if that I didn't talk to them for so long! They managed to cheer me up.\n* What do I love? Playing video games, drawing, chatting with friends, composing music, etc... I managed to get new tastes thanks to my ex-partner\n* Do I take care of myself? If that means cooking for myself, no, I can only cook for others. If that means going to therapy, yes, I instantly, after the break-up, went to therapy. I think I might have a cyclothymic disorder, I might go to the psychiatrist to be sure. I'm also very introspective.\n* Do I feel happy? It really depends. I love spending times with my friends, but I cannot count on them 100% of the time, I cannot be dependent again. I use my free time to feel joy, by playing games.\n\nWhat I should do:\n\n* Understand how to live for myself, getting a goal for myself, loving myself, prioritizing myself, feeling at home by myself, getting affection by myself for myself.\n* Pay my water bill, signing the check I got from Christmas, call the landlord my toilets are damaged.\n* Changing job. Maybe be a professional artist.\n* Getting rid of my mother. I don't want her attachment, I don't want her advice. We clearly don't have the same values and my fear of hurting her is preventing me from leaving her. But I should do it.\n* Getting company for a bit of every aspect of life. A little help is always welcome.\n* Forget empathy, embrace compassion. One can be learn.\n\nI hope I'll be fine! I'm an eternal optimistic person, I'm already lucky to have that!",

Hit the gym, previously weighed 63ish kilos and now weigh 73 kilos and have added a ton of muscle after a couple years of grinding. I now look big in shirts and although my confidence has improved a bit, I'm still not happy. Also grinded soccer training in this time period and got good, now start for a club and I only look forward to days I'm training and playing, everything else is painful. I started to take university seriously and am projected to graduate at the age of 23 with a few internships under my belt in the field of software engineering, leading to a job.\n\nMy feelings of inadequacy and no joy in life come from how my friends treat me. They used to respect me alot as a peer but I made some cringe videos on TikTok when I was really depressed in 2020 and they got shared around in group chats. I come from a small city so escaping these friends is not really an option. They also put down my success with women a bit (I'm average looking). The thing is, I know they like me and they constantly invite me to things, converse when we're hanging out and have included me in their futsal team, but I feel like I can't escape my past at all. I know I'm not really being picked on because if any of my friends did the same things, they would be roasted too (and are for similar things), but when they roast me although I completely take it in my stride in conversation I fall into a pit of sadness because I have low self - esteem. And I can't talk to them about it because in male friends groups like this it's looked down upon to converse about your feelings between each other if its not for self improvement/women/etc. \n\nI just feel like I can't escape this hole no matter what I do, bar me moving after University and starting my life properly but it seems so long away in 2024. Should I just accept this and get over the fact that in the internet age they're going to hold certain things against me because of ribbing and I'm just overthinking it, or should I cut them off and try for a new friend group (lmfao that would be tough everyone in my city has known each other since high school but maybe could be done)",

I wanna start taking pictures so I can remember what I looked like when I was young when I get older and to post on social media since I haven‚Äôt posted in a while. But every time I try to take a picture, it always comes out very ugly. I‚Äôve tried for a few years and honestly, my self confidence has plummeted every time I look at the camera. It wasn‚Äôt always like that. I use to be able to take decent pictures, but idk what has happened these last few years. The last time I took a decent picture was probably 2018, and before I knew it, it‚Äôs already 2023 and I don‚Äôt have any recent pictures. I don‚Äôt look that different either. \nIt‚Äôs not just me who thinks this either. Even friends have stopped taking pictures with me because what we see irl doesn‚Äôt translate to the camera somehow. They don‚Äôt say it because they‚Äôre too polite, but I kinda sense it and honestly I don‚Äôt blame them either, because I don‚Äôt want to look at myself on camera. I look decent in person, some might say even pretty, but on camera it‚Äôs a whole different story. Idk if I forgot my angles or the camera quality is not doing me any favors. \nAre there any settings I should adjust on my camera (I use a iphone camera)? It has really messed me up seeing myself on camera. Does anyone have any tips on how I can approach this sort of complex I‚Äôve developed. I know I can edit pictures, but I don‚Äôt want to have to edit them too much to the point I don‚Äôt even recognize myself. I don‚Äôt mind a little blur here and there to hide pimples or dark circles, but I‚Äôm afraid of going too extreme on the editing that my self image gets worse than it already has. \nTips or encouraging words are welcomed!",

I'm not sure what's caused it but I want out. And I don't know what to do. \n\nI WANT to call people and text with them and have conversations... But I don't know how, and I'm scared. I'm scared that Im going to end up like my parents, 50 or so years old with no friends. My dad is beginning to wake up and pursue some of his hobbies again, and my mom has done the same, but they already wasted so much of their lives, and it's a tragedy. I feel so bad for them, and so scared that that's going to be me. I see everyone else having really close connections with other people and I know they text regularly because I can see it. They don't seem to feel unwanted or alone because they always have a friend. \n\nI have people that care about me, but not really any peers who do. I feel so unloved and unwanted and I cried for about an hour tonight because today is Valentine's day and only served to remind me that I'm alone. I've always felt this way and I've been working on it for about 3 years but I still feel just as empty and lonely. I don't know what's wrong with me. I WANT to have those experiences while I still can... I'm scared of wasting my 20s. Most of my friends are people I talk to at a Bible study or church function. I love to mountain bike and play guitar, and wish I had some friends who were into that stuff and also as committed to God as I am. It's almost impossible for me to relate to others, and I feel like part of that is because I'm so committed to my faith that I just don't understand NOT being all in on it. \n\nI don't know what to do.

        "text": "\nSo backstory to the title the past year I‚Äôve been doing nothing but smoking weed with an abundance of friends, it‚Äôs foggy because the mental health issues and withdrawal, but I quit everything including bad habits, eating bad, everything. Because I want to achieve my goals so bad and so fast (also an issue I‚Äôm working on, slowing down and being consistent, but my brain keeps taking it as me being lazy) For the past month and a half I‚Äôve tried many things and keep burning out I have genuinely not stopped thinking for a month and I can feel it destroying my brain and body even though I‚Äôm in very good physical condition. So I am giving many things up and intending to implement them later but right now im cutting social media and constant contact with friends out entirely and all activities that overstimulate too easy. And as has been the problem with everything im doing to improve, stacked with the anxiety of my goals being on par with becoming the president, im feeling unbelievably lonely. It‚Äôs insane cause writing this out i see everywhere im going wrong and it‚Äôs all due to going way too fast, but im planning on sticking with the self improvement stuff first and cutting work out because a lot of it is art based and stress kills creativity, so back to the original question does anyone know if the feeling of loneliness will subside? I‚Äôve always loved sharing fun stuff I do with friends and filled my time hanging out with them, but 18-19 yr old friends aren‚Äôt really reliable when I like watching the sunset or exploring and most still smoke or play games. But I want to be alone most of the time now, I just need to reach the point of being able to do it healthily. I will still plan on having friends and family contact but I‚Äôm just in a state of constantly psyching myself out due to how crap and anxious I feel so I need someone to tell me it should get better or tell me it will take longer than I want it to so it‚Äôs better to stick with friends for now. I‚Äôm thinking of it  as a withdrawal type thing from social media and constantly seeing people but I know it‚Äôs more complex than that with how bad I‚Äôm feeling.\n\nSorry the whole thing is a mess punctuation wise and explanation wise but I really don‚Äôt have the energy. I feel horrible and it makes it worse at all comes from wanting to improve so bad. If anyone has any similar experience getting out of a rut like this they could share that would be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôm willing to do the work as long as it takes and I know it will snowball if I start right and be consistent, but I have adhd and I‚Äôm honestly really scared about cutting down for some reason because I don‚Äôt want to loose any of the things I aspire to do and end up not improving. Or worse, relapsing with more time on my hands.\nThis mess of a post is honestly a good example of what my brain has been like for a month, constant worry without logic behind it. It‚Äôs sucks cause I know I can do so much better now that I‚Äôm healthy without doing this to myself.",

        "text": "Over the course of the past three days, I have traversed a journey of self-discovery that has been nothing short of intriguing. Despite the occasional setback in terms of my metrics, I have been able to address a plethora of underlying issues that, if left unattended, would have inevitably led to greater trouble. Amongst these was my need to better structure my day-to-day schedule, in order to bring my goals closer to fruition. In the midst of preparing for and celebrating two birthdays and Valentine's Day, my progress was somewhat impeded, but I came to the realization that such events are a natural part of life and must not be allowed to obstruct my progress.\n\nAs someone who works outside the realm of a typical 9-to-5 job, I am all too aware of the variable nature of my schedule. To address this, I have resolved to awaken at the early hour of 6 a.m and use the first hour of my day to complete at least one task. This hour may be dedicated to studies, exercise, or even household chores - essentially, any task that will serve as a foundation for my day. It is, in essence, the classic \"make your bed in the morning\" practice, but on a larger scale.\n\nMoreover, I have come to appreciate the importance of maintaining a routine that includes self-care. Though it may seem trivial, I have found that taking the time to shower and groom myself in the morning yields significant benefits. The act of cleansing and preparing myself, far from being a mere afterthought, has become a vital component of my daily routine, and one that I prioritize above other activities. By doing so, I am able to approach my work with greater enthusiasm, knowing that I have attended to my own well-being. I have resolved to prioritize the enjoyment of my life as much as I do my work. In the past few days, I have made great strides towards achieving this, and am eager to continue on this journey of self-improvement.\n\nThis journey I'm on is already starting to impact my mental health for the better. Now that I've got a plan that doesn't solely revolve around work, I'm way less stressed. The days aren't blurring together anymore and time doesn't feel like it's slipping away. It's only been five days since I started, not even a full week, but it feels like it's been way longer. It's like I'm taking back control of my time and my life. My sleep quality already improved significantly. \n\nI want more than what I've been settling for and I'm slowly realizing how much I was fooling myself before by thinking that work was everything. It's time to embrace life outside of the office and get back to living. \n\nI am confident that by the 10th day (the day when I review my journey, its goals and its metrics) I will already be a better person than the person who woke up on Day 1. Afterwards, to another 10 days, until the 100th.",
