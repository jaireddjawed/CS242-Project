        "text": "My best friend has ADHD and its really getting in the way of our friendship - I am unsure if its worth continuing to be his friend.  He complains to me every time we talk, he has an obsession with money and asks me constantly if he should message a girl from a year ago to get his $20 back from buying her a drink on a date etc.., he steals from supermarkets and gets obsessed with girls he dates to the point of almost stalking. He actually flew to another country and showed up at a girls house to 'suprise' her as she has blocked him on everything. \n\nThe thing I am having problems with mostly is he is constantly asking things of me but doesn't help in return. I brought him a $300 ticket to watch the RHCP recently and when I asked him for a ride into town to pick up my car he told me no, things like that. In our whole friendship he has never brought me a coffee. He often rings me very depressed and lost with his life, he has an obsession with social media and his phone. I try to help him but he just won't apply what I tell him he needs to do e.g give up social media for a while, get off dating apps, get some hobbies. \n\nAnyway, are these normal ADHD behaviours or is he just not a good friend? Would love to hear someones perspective who has ADHD",

        "text": "Hello. We recently had our son evaluated and diagnosed with ADHD. We decided to tell him that he has it about two weeks ago. We decided in a simple approach and told him that his brain works a little differently just like some people need glasses to see better we will need to find ways to help his brain organize better. We did tell him what he has is called ADHD. He didn’t seem too curious about it yet. We stressed that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with him as we also learned through this process he can have some unspoken self doubts about his abilities and I want to try to boost him up. we printed out a list of famous people who have ADHD so he can see that many different kinds of people have it too. (I don’t know how accurate that list is though, Albert Einstein has it according to this list?) \n\nIf you were a a child diagnosed with ADHD what is something you wish adults in your life said to you or did for you? Today he said to me he just feels so unfocused in school and I am unsure of how to respond other than saying something like we can work on that??? I want to offer support and understanding. How can I explain ADHD to him? \n\nFor some more information we are trying to find a cognitive behavioral therapist which I’m sure can guide us in this too but we haven’t found one yet. Still working on that. We do have a meeting with his school next week to set up accommodations. Any recommendations on how I can be his advocate and his support would be amazing. Any books, podcasts, things I can do to help him understand himself …. \n\nI feel like I don’t know what I’m doing and I don’t want to coddle or baby him but I think I am. I want to do the right thing every day for him. I want him to know that he can have a fulfilling life and he always has me and his dad to support him and we will love him no matter what. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated so much.",

I always thought I was doing something wrong and became too embarrassed to pursue intimacy. I don't see this topic pop up too often (heh) in this subreddit. For me, the associated depression and loneliness became significant.\n\nMy brain literally cannot stay focused during sex and gets momentarily distracted from what's happening, leading to frequent erectile dysfunction. Concerta and my anti-epileptic medication also makes the problem worse.\n\nExample: \"Hmm, I wonder if most mattresses are manufactured in China. If so, does that mean there are whole shipping containers full of beds?... Oh yeah, I'm having sex.\"\n\nSo, I was recently prescribed generic Viagra and it has completely resolved the problem. When my brain starts to wander, I can now maintain an erection until I come back to reality about 30-90 seconds later. \n\nI made this post because I want to share my experience and spread information that there could be a helpful solution for other males like me.  I also want to reduce any misinformation that Viagra will make your dong hard for hours. *You still need to be aroused for anything to happen*, it just helps you maintain an erection. Once you're done with sex, the effect will go away. (yet still available in your system for up to 12 hours)\n\nObviously, everyone should talk to their doctor before taking new medication. I also started using the service HIMS. You can discuss these things with a doctor via chat and they can prescribe it.\n\nTo be clear, I am not endorsing any specific brand or service. If you're a male and find your brain wandering too much during sex, there could be help for you. You should make an appointment with a therapist or doctor, especially if it becomes something that negatively affects your mental health and/or relationships.",

Either I attach relatively quickly or I get bored easily and I’m very detached. I also have a tendency to lose track of time easily. I’ve accidentally ghosted a lot of people that I was talking to because I really thought that they didn’t respond to me or it hadn’t been that long since we last talked. In general, I find that it takes me a lot longer to feel comfortable with other people.

While I’m super excited, I’m also pretty nervous and don’t know what to expect. I’m also on 225mg of Effexor for depression/anxiety for over a year now which has been great. \n\nBasically, I’m just wondering what everyone’s experience has been with trying their first stimulant prescription for ADHD (bonus pints if you have binge-eating disorder as well 🥲).

As you may already know, the shortage has been ongoing since October and has left many patients, including children and adults, without the medication they need to manage their symptoms.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis shortage has had a serious impact on patients and their families, causing distress and anxiety as they struggle to find the medication they need. Some patients have had to resort to rationing their medication while others are going without their medication altogether, which is not a sustainable solution.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am writing to ask for your help in lobbying the federal government for a solution to this medication shortage. As a member of Congress, I believe you have the power to raise awareness of this issue and advocate for action to be taken to address the shortage.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI urge you to work with your colleagues in Congress to bring attention to this issue and encourage the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to take immediate action to resolve this shortage.

We've all accidentally double dosed before so we know what the high is, so I'm asking how close to that high are you at without it becoming an issue? I ask because some of my symptoms that I want to control (motivation) are at the higher end, but I get the negative side effects with it that I don't think allow it to be sustainable. Am I just cursed to be at such a low baseline motivation level that even stimulant meds don't normalize it and I need to accept it? For context I have been a very good boy and taken my meds as prescribed for the last 8 months, but I've dabbled in larger doses.",

        "text": "For as long as I can remember, my motivation was driven by either perfectionism or self loathing. Any accomplishment I made was meaningless because it was just something I was \"supposed to do\". Organization, cleaning and other less important-feeling things are a totally different story, that's always been a damn mess, but I digress.\n\nAll the things I've ever REALLY worked hard for have been because I felt like I wasn't good enough. I hated my body in high school and used that to fuel my drive to get fit and be better at sports. I spent several years of college conflicted about what I wanted to do with my life. Once I got to grad school I pushed myself harder to make up for lost time because I felt like an idiot who wasted years of my life and had to prove to... I don't know, everyone I guess, that I could do well. \n\nThis kept going into the first couple years of my career where I started burning out because I felt like the shittiest employee and tried so hard to overcompensate. I've finally gotten to a place where I can be kinder to myself and not internally berate myself for everything on a daily basis, but now... It's hard to find ways to stay motivated.\n\nI was diagnosed as an adult a couple years ago so I'm still pretty new to this, and unfortunately I haven't had luck with medication so far because my blood pressure can't seem to cooperate with them. I just don't know how to get past the barrier to starting stuff. Self hatred was enough to push me past that but that's obviously super unhealthy. But positive motivators don't seem to be enough to break that barrier. I don't know if my mindset is wrong or what the problem is. Has anyone here experienced something similar and successfully found motivation in a positive way? \n\nI've tried gratitude journaling and generally practicing positivity to try to change my attitude on things but it just felt so disingenuous and made me really anxious because I felt like I was lying to myself, and it made the self hate part of my brain push back harder. I feel like every time I make progress in therapy I get stuck in purgatory between accountability and self compassion and don't know how to go forward. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

(I never had a problem with sitting still throughout the whole class time.)\n\n...\n\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a PA and told him how I would get enough sleep but felt unrested, and how i had focus and memory issues. In response, he kinda laughed it off and told me he wished that he could get enough sleep and told me it was probably due to me having vitamin d deficiency. After taking vitamin d, I didn't really notice that much of a difference. I still felt unrested, low on energy, unfocused, etc. \n\nSo recently, I came to the conclusion that this isn't how a \"normal\" person should feel and saw a family medical doctor, told her what i've been feeling/going through and she suggested I try ADHD medication. (She prescribed Adderall 20 mg but my pharmacy didn't have it so I took d-amphetamine er 20 mg) \n\nToday is my first day taking the medication and it's been about 10 hours. I felt very anxious about taking it because of the side effects I've read, but decided to give it a try because I want to get better. \n\nIdk how I should be feeling or if the medication is actually working. \n\nI feel like I'm a bit more calm and speak a bit slower than usual. I noticed that I was a little more focused while driving? My head kinda feels weird though, Idk how to describe the feeling. \n\n• How do I know if the medication is actually working? \n\nImposter syndrome also kicked in. Which made me think maybe I was misdiagnosed? Maybe it is actually due to vitamin d deficiency and low b12 or my poor diet? Or i can't focus bcs I am glued to my phone most of the time? \n\n• What would be the effect of medication for someone without ADHD? \n\n\nSide note: I am the first in my family to be diagnosed/treated for ADD. (Mental health isn't really a topic in my family) \n\nOnce again, I apologize for the long post!! Thank you for reading. \n\nMaybe others can relate?",

Nothing works. I’ve even tried all of the other stimulants and they all had the same effects. I’m now on the lowest dose of focalin xr as a very last resort and the side effects are awful. I was going to try intuniv for a non-stimulant option but I already have chronic fatigue and I can’t risk adding to it, and apparently it doesn’t help focus in school much- which i really struggle with.

Things got bad for me in 2020 with work from home so I went back on my focalin, but I was never great at taking it consistently/daily (when I did things tended to be much better). \n\nI moved out of state in the second half of 2022 and didn’t find a new provider, so I stopped taking it. Things got progressively worse all fall. I work a full time job from home, work a consulting job part time, and am in school. I managed to do well in my classes in fall, but I’m hardcore failing at school right now. It’s only 1 “real” class, and I haven’t participated in discussion (20% of the grade) for 4 out of 8 weeks. \n\nI have an assignment worth 20% of the grade due tonight, and haven’t written one word and have only found the research articles (not read them). It’s only 500 words so I should be able to bust it out… but still. \n\nI could withdraw and take a “w” before Friday (in 2 days). Should I? At this point my GPA doesn’t matter (terminal degree), I just want to pass this class. \n\nI’m also starting a new full time job on Monday (still have the consulting one too). Will I be stretched too thin? \n\nI’ve been having trouble showering, making food, dishes, cleaning, even looking after my pets sufficiently (my bf picks up the slack thankfully regarding the pets). \n\nI also bought a house and have sooooo many projects that I’ve finally hired people to do stuff because we are failing to do it ourselves (examples: yard, painting, water heater). \n\nI just scroll social media allllllllllll day instead of starting my projects. I can handle work/job fine, it’s school and house projects that I can’t do.",

I have fatigue from anaemia, and currently, some mystery GI problem that's being investigated suspected crohns disease. I have tendinitis in my legs and nerve damage in my foot. I have eczema and am on immunospressents for that, which means I get sick more, and if I get sick, It can be deadly. \n\nI never really took note of this until I was complaining about my legs one day while walking down the stairs after asking to use the lift, and they pressured me to take the stairs. When I complained, one of my friends said, \"What do u want me to do? Take u to the hospital? Hahahah !\"\n\n This same friend has mocked me before. I had pneumonia and was close to recovering. I tried to walk up a hill and found myself incredibly breathless, I started panicking and basically hyperventilating. I called him to help, and that's what he did. He called me an ambulance because I kept blacking out, and all my muscles were seazed up, and I couldn't breathe properly. It's probably the worst pain I have ever experienced, and I'm quite used to pain. Basically, yes, I had a very blown out of proportion panic attack from not being able to breathe. A few minutes after the event, he left angrily and was like, \"How could u put me through that never do that again? \" ... as if it was my fault. He didn't speak to me for days after, even though I was vomiting from coming down from the shock and still on antibiotics from the pneumonia. I dont expect help.. but damn ... Anyway, about a year later, I mentioned this even, and he was like, \" Yeah, it was a bit pathetic. You basically had a panic attack... \" ... \n\nAnyways, back to the stairs. I literally stopped and said... no, but I want u not to mock my pain. And I just got silence... not a sorry, nothing ... I thought about it when I got home and had to take a truckload of painkillers, and I was like.. this has happened before. And I just sat there for 3 hours thinking about all the times I've been mocked and belittled and talked over. They've basically trained me to stfu. I never used to be quiet.

Things are going well and progressing but I'm struggling to understand and cope with a few things that has cropped up. I'm starting to have doubts if these are just ADHD symptoms or if this person just doesn't like me all that much. \n\nSome examples are\n\n* She never initiates conversations and doesn't make an effort to ask about me or what's going on in my life. When I do bring up struggles or stressors that I am facing, I don't feel that I'm being listened to or that she is empathetic. \n* We are fine in person with our banter and jokes but our texting and phone or video calls are just terrible where she seems uninterested and I have to carry the conversation. If I don't initiate texts to keep in contact we can go days without talking or maybe even a week if we don't see each other. My texts have been left on read multiple times without a reply and if she does remember to reply a day later she will apologize for being forgetful but it's starting to cause a bit of resentment on my side that I seem to be out of sight out of mind. I've casually brought this up a couple times but if this is really just due to her ADHD and not a lack of interest in me, then I have to make the hard decision of how to proceed.\n\nJust wondering if these are things that others here have struggled with and if anyone has any advice.",

What I’ve seen online is anything 17.5 g and over.\n\nFrom the warning on the bottle it says avoid high fat meal which to me means don’t have anything within 1 hour before/after taking pill. But since it’s ER it’s constantly in the body so does that mean to avoid high fat altogether for as long as I’m on it?\n\nI do like this medication but it’s so restrictive.

I will struggle without the accommodations and seek help to build systems to help me learn better. Having gotten by through school my whole life perfectly fine without studying, this was a wake-up call. Especially while juggling a full-time job in a big 4 offshore law firm.\n\nAnyway, to the point. I got prescribed Modafinil as a test for two weeks to see how I feel. I took the first one this morning and I cannot explain how I felt today... what are you supposed to feel? When does it really kick in? I cannot say that I had hyperfocus or anything.\n\nIf anything, I believe those million thoughts that race through my mind every second of the day turned into let's say thousands hahaha if that makes sense. I felt like I was moving in slow motion (mentally). A colleague said I didn't seem myself. I struggled to explain it but all I could come up with is my brain felt like I was Neo from the Matrix in that white room... images aren't allowed so you will have to google it.\n\nLastly, my colleague that is on the same meds told me she gets super focused and can retain information, etc while on it... Shouldn't I have felt something significant on the first day? Hopefully, I see differences throughout this two-week period. If not I suppose I will have to try something else.\n\nI am also looking into CBT / getting a coach. Does anyone have any experience in that?",

        "text": "Hey,\n\nThis might be a tad bit long - I'm not sure yet. I need to give a little bit of a backstory, I suppose - so, my mother is half Puerto Rican and she has curly, Spanish hair. However, she was adopted by a white family and I think they didn't really take any time to learn how to treat her hair. She never really knew, nor does she know now, how to do anything more than a ponytail. Growing up, my aunts were the ones that would braid my hair and style it. When we grew distant from my aunts and I was more of a teenager in control with my hair - I just kind of left it as is. Just my hair - but brushed (usually). My oldest sister would sometimes do buns, my middle sister had the fluffiest hair ever and never really knew what to do with it other than a ponytail. Eventually, she shaved it. I am now the only one in my family with long hair - besides my mom, who also just usually leaves her hair as is.\n\nAs of now the only thing I feel I can successfully do is ponytails and I've had increasing anxiety and overwhelmingness surrounding doing anything with my hair. My husband is black and only just recently cut off his dreads - so for three years, he had long hair and would style it in different buns and hairstyles. He has tried in the past to suggest me to try buns and whatnot. I would start to try - watch a video or read an article, try a few times and when I wouldn't get it, I would give up. It's like, if I don't get it in less than four shots, it's too overwhelming and I give up. Watching videos, I always feel like I miss some steps, but reading articles always feels like I'm missing something. Sometimes I just feel like some women have some sort of magic that allows them to just get it and style their hair. I feel like I'm missing that and I don't know if it's just because of how I grew up, or if maybe ADHD is involved as well? I know I tend to give up easily and I generally attribute that to ADHD and my lack of patience and inability to accept that I'm not perfect. I like to just \"get\" things and do things my way. I struggle with reading directions and often just try to do it myself - but then I usually end up with overly spiced food, or a chair that doesn't stay together, or a hair style that looks straight out of a yearbook photo for Wacky Hair Wednesdays.\n\nToday, my husband and I were experimenting with hairclips because it seems like something EASY. We watched a Tiktok over and over again and I tried to replicate and I just...didn't get it successfully and I ended up crying. I don't know. A part of me feels like hair is an essential part of womanhood and I missed out when I was a child because I didn't have many girl friends and once we became distant from my aunt, I had nobody to ask or help me through those steps and it feels deeply embarrassing at 25 to ask my friends for help doing a bun or braiding my hair. So I don't know if it's trauma, ADHD, or OCD or a mix of all - or something. I just feel so...overwhelmed by hair so I procrastinate doing anything and just continue with just brushing it and getting by.\n\nYet still, every now and then I want to mix it up and surprise my husband. Or just be like other women? And yet I feel like I can't. I just get frustrated, overwhelmed, and upset. So I give up and stop trying.\n\nI just want to know if anyone else struggles similarly? I feel so alone and so silly for being so deeply upset by this.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I was wondering if other people had experiences similar to mine. I was prescribed biphentin and Vyanse, initially started with biphenitn and it was decent. I was able to focus on school and stuff and didn’t really have crazy sides. I had a bloated stomach, weight loss issues, irritability, and I was a lot more stress, granted it was my junior year of high school and grades started to matter for university applications. It was alright but I was still not able to fully focus. So I switched to Vyanse. I didn’t notice any differences but I was told it was much better. Anyways I abused the drug for about 4 months. I was prescribed 70mg and I would take one in the morning and one in night so I can focus more and pull multiple all nighters. Anyways that screwed up my life significantly. After that I was not able to sleep. Even off the medication. I just could not sleep like I normally would. Anyways COVID\nhappened and I was trying to fix my sleep schedule but I would sleep at odd times like at 7am and 8am. And I would sleep for like 6 hours max if luck. It was weird because with on Biphentin I slept perfectly. I’m now getting treated for insomnia, which is also another mistake since my stupid psych put me on serqouel for 100mg and now I’m kind of addicted. Anyways I’m trying to get my life back on track, with school and stuff. But I can’t seem to tolerate the medication like I use to. I was off stimulants for two years and I kind of didn’t need it, cause everything was online and I could cheat. But now I’m back in person, I need stimulants to focus. However when I use a stimulants I start getting really anxious and focus on the wrong things, for example I’m currently losing my hair due to MPB and when I use Vyanse I obsess over that singular subject and research ways to combat it.  I guess on the medication I don’t have multiple thoughts at once, but I hate how I’m so much more stressed and anxious with the medication. I even go to the gym everyday, drink a lot of water. Try to sleep a minimum of 6 hours if my body will let me. I also have tried intuniv a couple times. I actually used only 10mg of Vyanse and 2mg of intuniv today morning and I literally had the craziest headache and was sweating so much even tho it was chilli in my room. It was a terrible feeling I was experiencing earlier today. Anyways I don’t understand why I’m sensitive now and I wasn’t before.",

        "text": "My nephew is 19 and really struggling. He was diagnosed with ADHD years ago, is on meds and sees a therapist, but none of this has helped much.\n\nHe graduated high school, finally, after a gap year and lots of struggle. Now he just seems to be drifting, or sinking. My sister tells me that he spends most of his time starting at his phone or his laptop. He doesn't want to go to college and has no interest in working or learning something that might turn into a career path. \n\nMy nephew is a very nice young man, gentle and introverted. If you met him you'd think he was a nice, quiet kid. He used to do creative writing, then stopped because any little bit of criticism was devastating to him. Now he has no hobbies or interests.\n\nHe barely eats most days, has to be urged to interact with people or even leave his room. He doesn't really have any friends. He used to, but he seems to have drifted away from them as his ADHD and depression have taken over.\n\nMy sister (his mother) has been his \"caregiver\" I guess you would say, for years now. She watches him daily to make sure he eats, remembers to shower, basic things like that. When he was in school she reminded him to do schoolwork, but her reminders could only go so far. \n\nMy sister is a two time cancer survivor and her health isn't the greatest. She worries about my nephew, and what will happen after she is no longer around to care for him. \n\nI think whatever meds my nephew is on must be wrong for him. I have suggested they try something different. Other than that, I'm at a loss. I'm here because I know there are young people here with ADHD who have found their way to a pretty full life, successful even. I hope you can share some ideas that might help my nephew.  \n\nAre there jobs or careers that align with ADHD?\n\nHow can we help him find some interest or passion that might bring him out of this deep depression, and make him want something for himself?\n\nWhat meds worked for you? What therapies?\n\nThank you in advance for any ideas you can share.",

I thought maybe I just wasn't getting enough sleep or that I was just being lazy and needed to stop getting distracted by games or random impulses while studying. When I was in middle school I exceled at my classes, and also did so for most of high school. But it feels like as my classes get harder and I have to sit down and really focus on calculus for example, it's been frustrating. I feel like there are some creative classes I love and will spend 6 hours on straight, but then if I have to do a boring analytical class like calculus for more than 5 minutes my brain starts fogging up. I feel so dumb, but it feels like no matter how hard I try my brain is just too foggy (and I usually end up getting distracted and watching YT videos instead). Feels like the only time I can get my analytical classes out of the way is in the morning when my mind is clearer. Recently its been really affecting my studying time and I'm not sure what to think. I feel like I don't want to 'make excuses' for myself and that I should just stop being lazy, but I also feel like constantly having a fuzzy and easily distracted mind isn't fun. I'll probably delete this later, but I wanted to at least just let out my frustrations. I really hold myself to a high standard, and so I don't want to just try and just come up with excuses, but I just feel like my brain is so clogged up 24/7. Sorry if this doesn't make complete sense and I don't mean to come off as rude or anything. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",
