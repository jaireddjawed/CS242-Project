A thinks the answer is B and B thinks the answer is A. They obviously can't be both right, and the universe does not have a correct or prefered referencial frame, so there is no reason the answer should be A rather than B.\n\nThe only other possible answer is that they are both wrong and their times are equally streched, so there's no apparent strech, but if you consider another person C moving towards one of them, but slower, in C's perspective the other one must be in a slower time rate, so A's and B's couldn't ve the same!!!!",

        "author": "defialpro",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/11icre5/clockwork_universe_a_hypothesis_on_determinism/",
        "text": " \n\nPicture this: the universe, in all its vastness and complexity, is like a clockwork machine, with every gear and cog turning in perfect synchronization. Every event in the universe, from the smallest subatomic particle to the largest galaxy cluster, is the result of the prior causes and conditions that led up to it.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: isn't that just determinism? And yes, you're right. But let me tell you, the scientific hypothesis that I'm about to lay out takes determinism to a whole new level.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the Big Bang. We all know that the universe began with a massive explosion, a moment of creation that brought about the formation of galaxies and stars. But what if I told you that the initial singularity, the point of infinite density and temperature that gave rise to the Big Bang, was actually a white hole?\n\nThat's right, a white hole. Stephen Hawking himself suggested in \"The Large Scale Structures of Space-Time\" that the initial singularity may have been a white hole, which would mean that the Big Bang was actually the result of an explosion of matter and energy that was forced out from the singularity.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. The universe, it turns out, is cyclical. After billions of years of expansion, galaxies and stars will eventually begin to drift apart from each other as the gravitational forces of dark energy take over. This is known as the Big Freeze, or the Heat Death of the Universe.\n\nHowever, as the universe continues to expand, the gravitational forces of matter will eventually overcome the accelerating expansion, causing the universe to collapse in on itself in a process known as the Big Crunch. And here's where things get even more interesting.\n\nThe Big Crunch is hypothesized to give rise to a Big Bounce, a moment of reversal where the universe rebounds and begins to expand once again. And every event in the universe, from the Big Crunch to the Big Bounce and back again, is deterministic, governed by the prior causes and conditions that led up to it.\n\nThe \"Axis of Evil\" pattern in the cosmic microwave background radiation is seen as providing evidence for the cyclical nature of the universe and the possibility of a future Big Crunch. An effect is always the result of a prior cause, and every event in the universe, no matter how seemingly random or chaotic, is ultimately the result of the prior causes and conditions that led up to it.\n\nSo, what does all of this mean for us? It challenges the idea of free will and raises philosophical questions about the purpose and meaning of the universe. But it also offers a deeper understanding of the universe as a deterministic, cyclical machine, with every event and every cycle governed by the laws of physics and the initial conditions of the universe.\n\nIn conclusion, the scientific hypothesis on determinism that I've presented, incorporating the Big Crunch, the Big Bounce, and the initial singularity as a white hole, is supported by evidence from Stephen Hawking's work on the initial singularity and the \"Axis of Evil\" pattern in the cosmic microwave background radiation. It offers a fascinating new perspective on the universe and the nature of causality, challenging our understanding of free will and the purpose of existence.\n\nThis hypothesis, which incorporates the Big Crunch, the Big Bounce, and the initial singularity as a white hole, is supported by a range of scientific evidence and theories, from the work of Stephen Hawking to observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nLet's start with the idea that the initial singularity may have been a white hole. Stephen Hawking, in his book \"The Large Scale Structures of Space-Time,\" suggests that the initial singularity may have been a white hole, rather than a black hole. He writes, \"The occurrence of a singularity in time...suggests that there may have been some kind of breakdown in the laws of physics...one possible way to avoid such a breakdown...is if the collapse does not continue indefinitely to a singularity, but is reversed when the density gets to a certain value.\" This reversal, Hawking suggests, could be due to the initial singularity being a white hole, which would have created an outward explosion of matter and energy.\n\nAnother piece of evidence for the hypothesis comes from the \"Axis of Evil\" pattern in the cosmic microwave background radiation. This pattern, first observed in 2004, suggests that the universe may have a preferred direction of rotation, which could be evidence for the cyclical nature of the universe and the possibility of a future Big Crunch. As cosmologist Neil Turok has said, \"The 'Axis of Evil' is one of the most puzzling observations in cosmology...if it is real, it opens a Pandora's box of possibilities, including the startling possibility that the universe eternally cycles through big bangs and big crunches.\"\n\nThe idea of causality, which posits that every effect is the result of a prior cause, is also central to this hypothesis. As physicist Sean Carroll has said, \"Determinism is simply the idea that the past determines the future...every moment of your life is causally connected to everything that's happened before it.\" This idea is supported by a range of scientific evidence and theories, from the laws of thermodynamics to the behavior of subatomic particles.\n\nOverall, the scientific hypothesis on determinism that I presented is supported by a range of scientific evidence and theories, including Hawking's work on the initial singularity, the \"Axis of Evil\" pattern in the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the idea of causality as it is understood in the laws of physics. While the hypothesis raises philosophical questions about the nature of free will and the purpose of existence, it offers a compelling framework for understanding the cyclical nature of the universe and the underlying causes and conditions that give rise to it.",

I have thought and reflected a lot as to what I would like to do after my undergraduate studies in terms of career as well as lifestyle choices. Though I enjoy my classes and have done a fair amount of projects at my university, I am becoming increasingly aware of the competition and sacrifices that are needed to be made if one wants to land something like a tenure position at a university.\n\nTo give some more context, I am primarily interested in astrophysics. For every course in maths method, data analysis or theory that I followed, it all became more intriguing once I find a link of it to the space sciences. A project I have done for some time was also the analyzing of open source data for gravitational wave events. Which made me learn quite a bit on signal filtering and GR (though the tensor calc and GR was for my own personal curiosity). I am currently self-teaching myself QM in the hopes to one day tackle something like QFT (as it’s an intriguing subject. Though I definitely do not want to do HEP theory/experiment, it is mainly for curiosity) &amp; understand more about quantum computing (as I did notice that this area is getting more funding and industry interest. And I barely know a thing about it unfortunately).\nOne of the projects I did recently was on radio astronomy. Trying to create a very small radio telescope using a simple setup with TV dongles. I enjoyed it quite a bit. And after reading on the subject and contacting people in the field, it started to seem even more intriguing. I wanted to ask if any of you out there are pursuing the field of radio astronomy. If so, what was your experience like? What topics did you need to get a grasp on to better understand aperture synthesis? And do you think that the field has transferable skills (besides the data science ones)? I have a similar question to anyone else reading this. Using your respective fields of course. \nAs I am at a point where even though I know I am going to do at least my master’s, I want to be more realistic with my prospects. As I am from a minority group that came to Europe to study, and I notice day by day that I am competing with people that are way more clever than me (imposter syndrome doesn’t help here either) or sometimes way more fortunate in their network (whether they know this or not. As they have parents and/or family friends who are in academia. Or had opportunities in high school that I could only dream of). This is something I cannot ignore. It is one of the reasons I decided that theory definitely won’t be something for me. Besides the bit stated on people much clever than me (and it objectively shows so if I were to compare GPAs. I’m in a place of 7.0/10 to 7.3/10, working in raising it ofc. While some of these people have 8.0/10 as a bare minimum), though I like theory, I can always pick up a book and teach myself any new physics or maths. But papers and articles in my fields of interest seem redundant and stagnant. Just add a new term to the scalar field so that it still fits our inflationary model, or let’s invent this new metric for black holes without proposing some observables. It is way too frequent to ignore. And in general it seems that the closer a physisicst works with experiments, the better his/her prospects. Hence, my interest shift towards observational astronomy (particularly radio).\n\nMy sincere apologies for the lengthy description, but I wanted to be thorough in giving a full context in order to avoid misunderstandings. Thank you in advance.",

In my chem class, they post pre curve grades, and then actual grades.\n\nHowever, I looked it up, and found that Physics courses accross the country sometimes have test averages of 20/100 and it seems like, regularly have averages of 40-50s.\n\nNow I'm guessing if the college doesnt want the majority of kids to get F's, this would imply there's a curve. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo just wondering if I could expect a curve? I know no one can really answer this for sure. But just wondering what the thoughts are. Several professors in the same department curve as well. I just want to do well this semester, and know I could work alot harder, but will not be as motivated for the countless quizzes, tests, and a final, if I know it's gonna lead to not much, especially due to the first one.\n\nLet me know if yall have any thoughts. Thanks.",

It's supposed to fit in a page and be appropriate for school.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Courtroom \nCourt Transcript - Case ∞+274\nGaseous Particles vs. Maxwell’s Demon\nBefore : Hon. Laplace’s Demon\n\nThe honourable Judge Laplace’s Demon, known and revered in the realm of quantum physics as an intellect that would be able to know all past and future events if it knew the positions and velocities of all atoms in the universe, conducts the bench trial of Maxwell’s Demon, accused of particle trafficking and breaching the second law of thermodynamics. The defendant is claimed to have been separating higher energy and lower energy particles in a two-part chamber, resulting in an overall decrease in entropy (the measure of a system's thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work). The defendant is represented by venerable lawyer (and not venerable lawyer as per quantum superposition), Schrodinger’s Cat. The plaintiffs, the gaseous particles, have chosen a high-energy particle to plead their case.\n\nJudge Laplace’ Demon: Order in the court! Ms. High-energy particle, you may make your case.\nHigh-energy particle: Yes, your honour. When Mr. Maxwell’s Demon so impishly committed this vulgar felony, several particle families were torn apart and the high-energy particles forced into labour to drive steam engine sweat-shops. I myself lost my mother and father during the transgression. Therefore, the accused must be charged not only with particle trafficking but also abuse and maltreatment. I rest my case.\nJudge Laplace’s Demon: The defence may make their case.\nSchrodinger’s Cat: Your honour, how can we be certain that Mr. Maxwell’s Demon did, in fact, commit this \n`offence? According to the phenomenon of quantum superposition, in order for an object to have a wavelength, it must exist over some region of space. This means that it can exist in several states at the same time. I myself was once considered both dead and alive in a box before an observation determined my state. By this logic, we can claim that my client was both guilty and not guilty of the crime while also claiming that anyone in this courtroom may be guilty and not guilty of the same crime since we occupy infinite states at any given moment. How are we to know that the gaseous particles are not themselves guilty?\nHigh-energy particle: Objection, your honour!\nJudge Laplace’s Demon: Sustained.\nHigh-energy particle: There was in fact someone who observed Mr. Maxwell’s Demon’s mischief, thus confirming his status as a criminal. I call to the stand Wigner’s Friend!\nJudge Laplace: Mr. Wigner’s Friend, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?\nWigner’s friend: I do\nHigh-energy particle: Mr. Wigner’s Friend, you observed Mr. Maxwell’s Demon commit the transgression. Correct?\nWigner’s Friend: Yes, I did.\nSchrodinger’s Cat: If i may, your honour, Mr. Wigner’s Friend, were you or were you not under the observation of your friend Mr. Wigner while you conducted the experiment?\nWigner’s Friend: Yes.\nSchrodinger’s Cat: Therefore, you would be in a state of quantum entanglement with the experiment. In that case, your observation would be correct and incorrect until Mr. Wigner made his observation. \nHigh-energy particle: Objection, hearsay!\nJudge Laplace’s Demon: Sustained. I will now deliberate and reach a verdict.\n( five chronons later)\nJudge Laplace’s Demon: After careful deliberation, I have found Mr. Maxwell’s Demon guilty of particle trafficking and forced-labour. I thereby sentence you to 54,367,809π chronons in the nth circle of quantum hell and insist a payment of 400,000,000 quanta to displaced particle families. Do you have anything to say?\nMaxwell’s Demon: Just this: you high-energy particles should go back to your own molecular country!",

        "text": "I want to get into the International Physics Olympiad in my junior or senior year in high school. My sophomore year will end by this month and I don't have to go back to school until June. Can you guys recommend some high level material and practice material which will help me elevate myself from basic sophomore levels of physics (basic to intermediate (4/10) knowledge on varying topics like vector, optics, electromagnetism) to represent-my-country levels of math because I think I could. i'm also debating b/w a math or science (phy or chem) olympiad since i am starting from scratch anyways i think an overview of what i need to study will allow me to take an informed decision hence i request you to begin giving me material (must be free/online) and also any advice.\n\nAny reply would be much appreciated.",
