        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/6yapip/hi_rriddles_i_created_a_website_with_some_riddle/",
        "text": "Hi /r/riddles, I created a website as a dev project a couple years ago and have had in the back of my mind its potential for creating riddle tunnels but never got around to giving it a go. \n\nTo briefly explain what the site is, it's a very long collection of tiles, which are placed sequentially. There's so many that scrolling through them all would take lifetimes, but you can jump to any tile if you type in its number. You can edit any tile by clicking on it and you can claim tiles for exclusive editing rights.\n\nThe idea would be to create a tunnel of riddles which lead to each other as you solve them. For example a riddle written on tile number 500 may have an answer of 64,434,430, on which tile there's another riddle leading to tile 564,645,646 and so on. You'd need some way to convert text answers to numbers but I guess there's a few ways to achieve that.\n\nI went ahead and made up some riddles to give a proper example (starting with an easy one) and I've never made up my own riddles before so apologies if they're terrible: \n\n~\n\n**Riddle 1:**\n\n10 progress you must speak my language\n\n1101111011011111101101\n\n~\n\n**Riddle 2:**\n\nI am a combination of years, beginning with a use for gears,\n\nMy second helps your clothes transpose and enclose, \n\nMy next delivers words with no need for postmen or birds,\n\nMy final revealed Mars as well as distant moons and stars.\n\n~\n\nThe first you can find at tile number 4518603, which you can reach at this address:\n\nhttps://infinitehomepage.com/4518603\n\nThe second can be found by entering the answer to the first into the top right 'goto' box, or by adding to the URL after the last forward slash.\n\n[Spoiler For Riddle 1 (Link to Tile)](https://infinitehomepage.com/3651565)\n\n\nI should mention that as the internet has been given anonymous access to the site for over a year, there may be some edgy messages posted, especially on the first hundred tiles. It gets far emptier once you descend below 5,000 or so.\n\nAs a final note, I never did activate the monitization for the site, it was designed more for entertaining corporate interests if the site got really big than for people posting riddles, so if anyone wants a bunch of the tile claiming currency for riddle tunnel making, then please send me a message, I'm happy to just dish it out.\n\nIf the mods of /r/riddles find any of this inappropriate, then I'm more than happy to just share the other two riddles I wrote here instead.\n\nEdit: Created a 5th and 6th riddle for the tunnel. Not sure when to stop and make a new one!\n\n\n\n",

So it is suspected that the binary translates into words that are hinting the solution. Also many people are suspecting that the 180 means that you reverse whatever you get and in the end we need a 10 digit number with no 0s (1-9 numbers) and it is suspected that you ad 1 to every digit to form the final answer (+1111111111)\n\nMany people are working on this in different subreddits but maybe you guys have a different approach to it and are able to solve it. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nedit: i tried to format it with line breaks but it didnt work properly at all. please see the link for the correct formatting/line breaks.\n\n",
