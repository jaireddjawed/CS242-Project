Using this probability distribution I generate very large random sequences of page requests (which would resemble a realisitc program since this is drawn from the realisitc probability distribution.).\n3. I would then feed this sequence to a simulation of various paging algorithms and calculate the number of page faults in each of them.\n\n**Problem**\n\nHow do I find the logs of page requests of a typical program?\nIs there some program on linux to get the logs of page requests from a program?

However there’s this famous “TSP Solver” called [Concorde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde_TSP_Solver) which doesn’t state an approximation ratio nor does it say that it’s an approximator. Obviously, this doesn’t mean that it will solve any given instance of TSP in polynomial time, but I find it remarkable that no such metrics are given. \n\nI would appreciate some insight into how this can exist.",

I've received great feedback from physicists, but I've yet to run the ideas by anyone from the CS / math community. I'd appreciate your thoughts: a link to my working paper is below. I'd of course be happy to answer any questions you might have.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/323684258_A_Computational_Model_of_Time-Dilation",

        "text": "Hey there!\n\nI'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit for this topic, but I thought I'd post it, and then rather move it to another subreddit if it wasn't deemed appropriate.\n\nI'm about to complete my first year of a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm enjoying it a lot so far, but there's one question which is sort-of not, at least so far, covered by any of my modules, that I thought you guys could have an input on.\n\nI've always thought about the concept of having computers inside computers. What I mean by that, is that I'm facinated by the concept of not performing direct calculation on a computer, but rather \"simulating a world\" in which some simple rules apply, and then use the world you're simulating to make a computer. One example of this would be from the game Minecraft (which I'm sure some are familiar with) where you can use *redstone* to create wires and simple logic, and if you're doing things correctly, you can set up these to perform simple (or in some cases more advanced) calculations. This means that what the actual, physical computer is doing, is just performing claculations that enforce a set of rules which apply to Minecraft's world. A more advanced example would for example be to have a system simulating electron flow through wires and the nature by which this happens, but virtually setting up these wires the same way a physical computer is set up.\n\nThis is of course a very lossy process, but one that I still find interesting. Are there any areas of computer science that encompass this? If so, I'd love to know about and read up on it.\n\nWhat my theory is, is that you could never have a computer running a simulation, and then in the simulation make a computer that's more powerful than the one you're physically using. I'm expecting this to be a theory that's true, because if that was the case, you could just have a \"chain\" of gradually more powerful computers, meaning any computer could be infinitely powerful. I'm more interested in the computer science related answers to *why* this was to fail if you tried. And also, it would be very interesting to know how lossy this process is, if it has any practical application, and anything else that's relevant.\n\nI'm interested in any input regarding this!",

Background: I have a B.S in Mathematics, and I've taken a normal linear algebra course, and an advanced one which was a purely theoretical treatment, consisting of the determinant as a permutation, hermitian operators and the likes. I've also taken a numerical analysis course, so I should be fine going into numerical linear algebra. As for Convex analysis, I've taken Real Analysis I and II so I also have the appropriate background for it.",
