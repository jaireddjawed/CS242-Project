While this comparison could be construed as tongue-in-cheek, user *Kamagamaga* posits that: \n&gt;[While I do think it would be stupid to make a conclusion based on flag colors...you have to wonder how fucking dumb these people are to choose a color scheme that has been used by the people you say you are fighting. They aren't sending their best (they are, kekbless us).](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/66rtay/hey_antifa_care_to_explain/dgl0duc/)\n\nHowever, the use of a red-black flag predates the Nazis. A pure black flag was the typical flag of anarchism, and red commonly associated with communism and sometimes with anarchy. While the [red-black flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Anarchist_flag.svg) for anarcho-syndicalism (and sometimes anarchism) may have been used as early as the 1870's, it was definitely adopted with the formation of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). In *The Spanish Anarchists: The Heroic Years 1868-1936* by Murray Bookchin, he writes:\n&gt;\"The presence of black flags together with red ones became a feature of Anarchist\ndemonstrations throughout Europe and the Americas. With the establishment\nof the CNT, a single flag on which black and red were separated\ndiagonally, was adopted and used mainly in Spain.\"\n-(Page 65, 1st Edition)\n\nThe Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) was founded in 1910, making it's red-black flag predate the Nazi flag by at least a decade (and thus the red and black flags it drew inspiration from originated even earlier). There are many different KKK flags, but the 'Invisible Empire' one is believed to have originated [no earlier than 1915](http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us%7Dkkk.html).\n\nThe logo of [Antifaschistische Aktion](https://www.roter-shop.de/media/image/69/80/b0/a103_600x600.jpg), which is featured on the flag commonly flown at the recent anti-fascism protests in the USA shows a red and black flag waving together and [symbolizes anarchists and communists uniting against fascism](http://loeser.us/flags/hate.html). The individual flags in the symbol predate the featured flags of the Nazis and the KKK and as such the similar use of a red-black color scheme was not a \"fucking dumb\" choice. ",

By 1939 the empire had 184 destroyers, by 1946 it had 277. Now consider 50 of those 277 were American destroyers, therefore Britain only manufactured 43. GB was sold more destroyers by America than she produced throughout the war.\n\nFirst, this is badmath, since the calculation assumes that no British destroyers were sunk or decommissioned (since for some reason they use an end date of 1946), so even if the start and end numbers are correct (which I doubt), this claim is clearly false.\n\nNow, let's count the destroyers the British commissioned during WW2, using this Wikipedia list and its links to each destroyer class (parentheses denote destroyers built in the UK for other countries):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_destroyer_classes_of_the_Royal_Navy\n\nex-Turkish I class: 2\n\nTribal Class: (4 built in the UK for the Royal Canadian Navy)\n\nK class: 7 commissioned after September 1, 1939.\n\nN class: (8 built in the UK for the Royal Canadian Navy, the Netherlands, and Poland)\n\nHunt Class: 72 (+14 more given to Norway, France, Greece, and Poland)\n\nL and M Classes: 15 (+1 built in the UK and given to Poland)\n\nO and P Classes: 16\n\nQ and R Classes: 14 (+2 built in the UK and given to the Royal Australian Navy)\n\nS and T Classes: 14 (+2 built in the UK and given to Norway)\n\nU and V Classes: 15 (+1 built in the UK and given to the Royal Canadian Navy)\n\nW and Z Classes: 16\n\nC Class: 1 commissioned on June 6, 1945, 2 commissioned in August 23 and 24, 1945, between VJ day and the official Japanese surrender. To be conservative, I'll say the latter 2 don't count as commissioned during the war.\nBattle Class: 5 commissioned before the end of the war (may be more, but the Wiki page for the class didn't list commission dates, so I stopped clicking individual destroyers' pages once the commission dates got into 1946).\n\nThat's a total of 177 destroyers, 209 if you include ships built in the UK for its allies during the war. \n\nBy comparison, the United States commissioned 309 destroyers during the war (including before Pearl Harbor). Thus, the Royal Navy's destroyer production looks pretty damn impressive for a power commonly thought of as helpless/bankrupt/close to starvation during the war. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! It is time for the second part of my review of Modern Marvels: Barbarian Battle Tech:\n\n20.31: The \"expert\" said that the Huns had an advantage because, as archers, Romans could not reach them. That ignores that Romans had incorporated ranged troops into their military system for several *centuries* by the 5th Century AD, including those who used composite bows. DRINK!\n\n21.07: The \"expert\" says the stirrup is vital for combat on horse-back. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *inhale* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. I shall let the Scythians, Achaemenid Persians, Parthians, Sassanid Persians, Celts, Germans, Macedonians, Romans, Assyrians, Indians and other cultures know that they were never had effective calvary because they did not have stirrups. The four-horned saddle of the Celts and Romans was actually very effective at supporting a rider and keeping them in place. DRINK!\n\n22.27: The narrator says the Goths would be the first barbarians to storm through the gates of Rome. So obviously the Celtic warlord Brennus never existed in this timeline. DRINK!\n\n23.00: The narrator states the Roman Empire was declining, even though the Eastern portion remained very stable and later managed to reconquer Italy, North Africa and parts of Spain. DRINK!\n\n23.04: ANACHRONISTIC SWORD WITH CROSS-GUARD! DRINK!\n\n 24.32: The warrior in the background has yet *another* sword that belongs to the late medieval period. DRINK!\n\n25.35: Narrator mentions a character from a fantasy novel. DRINK!\n\n26.07: Again the narrator refers to the Roman empire as decaying, without making a distinction between the eastern and western portions. DRINK!\n\n26.44: The narrator says that the Romans were forced to manufacture fewer slashing swords and make more stabbing weapons. Lol wut? The Roman military was practically defined by its use of a sword *design for stabbing*. What occured was actually the opposite, the Romans adopted longer swords more suited for slashing a result of cavalry becoming more wide-spread and the use of looser formations. DRINK!\n\n27.05: \"The effects of this going into a person were quite shocking.\" Hehehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n28.17: And yet one more sword that originates from the late medieval period. DRINK!\n\n29.30: Gah! The historian asserts Rome was sacked for the first time by the Goths. It was already plundered by the Celts back in 387 BC! DRINK!\n\n29.58.  The Roman Empire was dying so much it lasted around another 950 years.\n\n31.08: Fact of the day: Axes are axe-shaped.\n\n31.42: \"And their length varied between 5 and 12 inches\". That is always what I try to remind my girlfriends.\n\n33.02: The narrator says the Roman Empire collapsed in 410 AD, again completely ignoring Constantinople. DRINK!\n\n33.35: \"They believed in a large group of gods who all had power\". As opposed to large group of gods who all had no power.\n\n35.09: If the narrator says getting together in a building and drinking is a bygone institution of Anglo-Saxon culture, he has never been to Australia.\n\n37.41: That seax is inaccurate as it is neither huge, and nor does it have a cross-guard.\n\n39.25: And now the show is using Rome: Total War as a means of determining the best barbarian weapon. Except there is no such thing as \"best\" weapon. Arms and armor are situational, and contingent upon a variety of geographic, social and economic factors. Sure, swords are great a close-in engagements, but spears are far cheaper and so allow the mobilisation of larger forces. Large shields are great for forming shield walls, but not so good for lighter skirmishing troops. I shall down the rest of the bottle just for this entire section. *DRIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNKKKKKKSSSSSSSSS*.\n\nAnd that is done!\n\nSources\n\nThe Ancient Celts, by Barry Cunliffe\n\nThe Composite Bow, by Mike Loades and Peter Dennis\n\nFrom Sumer to Rome: The Military Capabilities of Ancient Armies, by Richard A.

        "text": "Well, I finally did it. I finally dug around on the internet for scholarship on ancient Egypt and ran into one of those Afrocentrist sites I have heard so much about. How bad is it? [Bad](http://www.stewartsynopsis.com/black_egyptians_are_the_original.htm). So I decided to read further specifically with this sub in mind only to have regrets because the site itself is like licking the removed comments of reddit and throwing them back up in blog format.\n&gt;Egypt is a Greek word meaning “Black.”\n\n-_- ...really? That sounds kind of stupid but I can not quite put my finger on it....maybe because Egypt is not a word from the Greek language, or maybe because the most accepted etymology considers it a corruption of an Egyptian title for the temple of Ptah. Did whoever wrote this once read somewhere about the etymology of Ethiopia and kind of half forget but included their mistaken \"iirc\" anyway or are they deliberately lying? \n\n&gt;The Egyptians of the Bible were Negroid. \nbullet The Bible says both Egyptians and Ethiopians are descendants of Ham. \n\nThe Bible does not say anywhere that anyone was \"Negroid\", I read the Bible actually and I do not remember this anywhere. Plus I thought Hamitic race theory stopped being a thing in the early 20th century.\n\n&gt;After the conquest of Egypt by Alexander, under the Ptolemies, crossbreeding between white Greeks and black Egyptians flourished.  \n\nFirst off, ew. Stop calling interracial relations crossbreeding, second with Greek immigrants comprising between 5-10% of the population, tops this could not have significantly altered the makeup of the native Egyptian population. In the *poleis* intermarriage between Greeks and native Egyptians did not occur and in the *chora* it is difficult to tell how much intermarriage actually occurred and how much cultural integration and adaptive naming conventions impact epigraphic evidence. For instance, we might at first assume that a man with a Greek name described as a Thracian who marries a woman with an Egyptian name is a clear cut case but when we have records showing mixed naming conventions, language and even ethnicity between parents and children or siblings things get a bit more complicated. In any case, intermarriage and immigration literally could not have significantly altered the Egyptian populations genetic makeup as by the time a greater level of assimilation is occurring in the latter half of the 2nd century BCE, significant Helladic immigration has effectively stalled as it peaked in the 3rd century. If Persian, Arab, Jewish, Syrian and Indian immigrants combined to make up another 5% of the population (which is quite a stretch) it still could not have significantly impacted the population because they tended to be concentrated in the urban centres where they married within their ethnic neighbourhoods, self segregation to an extent. And again, the Greco-Macedonian settlers did not arrive in Egypt and start marrying Egyptians left and right, in the *poleis* intermarriage was not legal (even Cyreneans were not allowed to marry Greeks) and on the whole there were still feelings of superiority and tensions between the various groups. The royal line remained predominantly Macedonian and not Egyptian at all, not to mention that although a great degree of assimilation and Hellenisation occurred it was in all likelihood spurred on by *cultural* integration not purely through ethnic mixing. Ptolemaic Egypt was weird and complicated but whoever wrote this blurb is still an idiot.\n\n&gt;These facts prove that if the Egyptian people had originally been white, it might well have remained so. If Herodotus found it still black after so much crossbreeding, it must have been basic black at the start.\n\nOh, OK tell me about Herodotus' magical time travelling powers that he could have written about the late Ptolemaic kingdom when he died a century before the Macedonian conquest. Please, I am waiting for this enlightening information.\n\nAlso wtf is \"basic black\"? Are all Africans supposed to look like Djimon Hounsou and anything else is an ethnic expansion pack? Is this entire site just a well spring of racism-actually no, I think I answered my own question. Hamitic race theory is invoked more than once so, yeah.\n\n&gt;Humanity born at the latitude of the African Great Lakes, near the Ecuador is by necessity pigmented (black) and African\n\nHeh, OK Ecuador is a country, but I think someone meant the *equator*. I am no anthropologist but I was under the impression that \"African\"referred to people or things that were from Africa. I realize the irony of this but the best argument that came to mind was that Native Americans and Asians living near the equator were not black. \n\n&gt;The seven liberal arts and sciences, which are grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy, come out of Africa. Therefore, to the Ancient Egyptians, and neither to the Greeks, nor to the Romans, are we indebted for the present body of human knowledge. Greece and Rome were average students in Ancient Egypt. Considered foreigners and childish, Greek students were unable to access a complete initiation and induction within the Ancient Egyptian Mystery System.\n\nI do not understand this, the sum of human knowledge did not emerge fully formed in our past, it is still forming and has never stopped because people have always contributed to it. Arguably the ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations were the cradle of many of these concepts and they helped to develop them, but Greek thought went down an entirely different path than Egyptian. The Greeks and Romans developed their own ideas and worldviews as well as further advancing the sciences particularly in medicine and architecture. You can not even directly trace Greek philosophy back to Egyptian because they are based around an entirely different thought system. The whole conservatism, balance and status quo ideals were not central in Greek philosophy the way they were in Egyptian and this is reflected in rhetoric and literature. \n\nPlus how were Rome and Greece \"average students\"? If he means the cultures themselves I wonder why we use a legal system based on Roman law in most Western countries and why a medical dictionary is basically a grabbag of Greek and Latin, or why government buildings are frequently built to invoke Graeco-Roman imagery. Do not get me wrong, ancient Egypt made a huge impact on the culture and sciences that were built upon by later civilisations but how can you just completely toss out the impact that Greece and Rome made on the world? And you know, the remark about childish foreigners is pretty random if we consider that most ancient peoples looked down on foreigners and I guarantee you that Greeks looked down on Egyptians the way Egyptians looked down on Ionians. And again the ancient Egyptians also looked down on Asiatics, Libyans and Nubians so if we want to play the ancient stereotype game *EVERYONE* gets to be a savage because you can be sure at some point everyone's neighbours thought so at some point in thousands of years of history. And of course \"Greece\" and \"Rome\" are not singular entities that were personally taught by Egypt. \n\n&gt;Aristotle of Stagira, Thales of Miletus, Pythagoras of Samos, Diodorus of Sicily, Plato and Strabo were all initiated in Ancient Egypt, from a very young age until adulthood. Their eyewitness accounts reflect the fact that they were taught and instructed by dark skinned teachers born and raised in Africa. Greed, prestige and reputation made most of them ungrateful, when they claimed all the theories and theorems, formulas and axioms they learned in Ancient Egypt for themselves. Most Greek and Roman students of Africa committed plagiarism by signing their names on their African teachers writings, inventions,\n creations and productions.\n\n&gt;Thus, we now have: \"Theorem of Pythagoras\", \"Thales' Axiom\" among many illegal appropriations of the African sciences of geometry, mathematics, architecture, rhetoric and philosophy. Those operative sciences have been invented and implemented in the heart of Africa, thousands of years before the Greeks and Romans came into existence as a distinct race!\n\nNone of those men grew up in Egypt and I wonder what theorems Diodorus and Strabo stole given that they were historians, well Strabo was also a geographer and philosopher but you get my point. Also what eyewitness accounts of Aristotle's youth as the disciple of black teachers that he openly plagiarized exists? Even if every single good idea that a Greek or Roman ever had was ripped off from an Egyptian, how would this blogger know that they very specifically replaced their tutor's name with their own to go off in search of fame and fortune? Also I dare anyone alive to prove that this occurred or even find evidence hinting at the idea that all quintessentially Greek and Roman thought is plagiarism. It is one of those unprovable leaps of reason that I can not even argue, it is not true because it can not be, much like ancient aliens. Also he says \"illegal appropriations\" as though copyright law is being invoked. And Egypt is not in the heart of Africa it is pretty much the North East corner, but really that is not the worst part of that statement. This whole situation has gone from annoying to funny to aggravating and is now just sad. I am actually sad after reading this.\n\n&gt;That saga continues today with the renaming of African scientific papyri such as the \"Rhind Papyri\" and the \"Moscow mathematical Papyri\". Those Papyri and their scientific content were produced and elaborated thousands of years before Rhind's people were born. Eastern Europe was still under the ice-age with barbaric people. Moscow, nor any of its founders, were even in existence at the time.\n\nI do not think that giving Egyptian papyri nicknames is appropriation because no one is even saying they originated in those areas, kind of like how George Ebers and Edwin Smith were not trying to plagiarize ancient Egyptian physicians, it is a *nickname*, even Wikipedia acknowledges their Egyptian origin and it is not like everyone is going to start forgetting Egyptian hieroglyphs are not Russian. And again, no anthropologist but it is safe to say that people were living in Europe for a lot longer than Dynastic Egypt was around, actually longer than recorded history. Like some kind of \"pre-history\".\n\nLet me also take a look at the section entitled [Europe (Ancient Rome) Conquered by Africans](http://www.stewartsynopsis.com/europe_conquered_by_africans.htm).\n\n&gt;It started with the Moors in Rome--Septimius Severus\n\n&gt;Black rulership of the Roman Empire begins in 193 A.D. with African born, Roman Emperor Septimius Severus. There were four other Black emperors after the Severus dynasty.\n\nOK stop using \"Moor\" as a historic sounding placeholder for black because not all North Africans were Moors and Moors were not entirely or even predominantly black skinned. Second, Septimius Severus' father was of Berber descent and his mother in all likelihood of Roman descent so I doubt he was all that dark but you know what, I never met him so I will grudgingly let that go but it is entirely disingenuous to paint his reign as some African takeover of Rome. Also it is *Severan* dynasty and of course no sources will be forthcoming on those four other emperors.\n\n&gt;Black ruler ship was widespread in Europe during the \"Dark\" &amp; Middle Ages! \n\nI must admit this is a worthy pun but it is still historically inaccurate. The Dark Ages were not called that because of black people and most ruling dynasties throughout Europe were...European? Weird.\n\n&gt;The original \"knights\" of England were Black!-- including the knights of King Arthur's Round Table! That's why they were called \"knights\" after the night or darkness of their skin.\n\nAt this point it reads like satire but no, he means it. I guess to satisfy R5 I want to point out that the term \"knight\" was not a well-meaning racial slur. Also, TIL King Arthur was 100% legit and so was the Round Table.\n\n&gt;Halfdan the Black was the first Africoid king to unite Norway. \n\nOn the one hand his family tree is supposedly Scandinavian but on the other hand assuming that innocuous and vague nickname is proof of his racial origin just sounds so credible..\n\n&gt;When the British Isles were invaded by the Vikings some of these Norse raiders were Africoid.  In fact, different varieties of ‘Viking’ Africans lived in Scandinavia during the middle ages and are frequently mentioned in Viking sagas. \n\nThat has never been shown, I honestly think that the \"writer\" just made that up so this makes sense\n&gt; Another Viking, more notable than Thorhall, was Earl Thorfinn, \"the most distinguished of all the earls in the Islands.\"  Thorfinn ruled over nine earldoms in Scotland and Ireland, and died at the age of seventy-five.  His widow married the king of Scotland. Thorfinn was described as \"one of the largest men in point of stature, and ugly, sharp featured, and somewhat tawny, and the most martial looking man. It has been related that he was the foremost of all his men.\"\n\n&gt;I turned around and saw a marvelous bust of Septimius Severus.  And then I saw busts and statues of Septimius' two sons--Geta and Caracalla and they all looked Africoid too, some more so than others.  I had stumbled (or was I divinely led?) into a room that I had no prior knowledge of filled with these images of African looking Roman emperors!  \n&gt;This dynasty, known to historians as the Severan Dynasty, began with the accession to the throne of Septimius Severus in 193 C.E.  In actuality, Septimius shared the throne for two years with a certain Pesennius Niger.  Indeed, could Pesennius Niger, another of Rome's outstanding military commanders, himself have been an African?  His name certainly indicates the possibility.\n\nYes, Inanity the patron deity of lunacy guided your eyes to a set of marble statues and allowed you to believe that you can accurately assess their skin tone on the basis of a statue. And is \"Africoid\" going to be a thing now? I am not OK with that, racial typology is pretty 19th-early 20th century and although I am no anthropologist there is nothing that screams West/Saharan African about the features of Caracalla and why does his skin tone matter anyway. The surname Niger could also literally mean anything else, I mean is Rebecca Black actually black?\n\n&gt;Young Septimius, coming from a family of Romanized Africans, received a education rooted in Roman literature and quickly learned to speak Latin.  After his formal education was completed he adopted an official career and became a civil magistrate.  Later, he became a military commander, and this took him to Rome where he proved himself an able and popular and conscious military leader.  He is even said to have built a marble tomb for Hannibal Barca--early Rome's African nemesis.\n\nHannibal was Carthaginian, meaning Phoenician, meaning Levantine and he was about as African as Cleopatra (which is probably not in any way at all). Also was a pan-African cultural and ethnic identity shared by Phoenician, Libyan, Berber, Egyptian, and Ethiopan groups in antiquity? Rhetorical question, obviously not as the ideology surrounding modern identities based on European or African heritage did not exist yet so this is like saying Julius Caesar felt kinship with Vercingetorix over shared European heritage.\n\n&gt;Black types can be found as early as Minoan Crete and are mentioned frequently in later Grecian writings. \n\nEarly Greek art has also proven that Greeks were two-dimensional and red or gold the world was awash in technicolour as they frolicked with satyrs before slaying now extinct monsters. Or, you know it is always possible that Minoan art was highly stylized like that of many other Bronze Age cultures. And \"black types\" presumably means black skinned Greeks but I honestly can not think of a single piece of literature that supports the claim that the ancient Greeks were black, sorry.\n\nAnd one thing, if the ancient Greeks were black than how did they \"steal\" \"black achievements\" from the ancient Egyptians?\n\n&gt;Alexander, Julius Caesar, the Spartans, and the rest of those celebrated men of antiquity in that region loved men more than women.  Females were there disproportionately for reproduction and servitude.\n\n[face palms] You know, just...no, OK? Did this person just lump all of Greek and Roman history from Classical Sparta to the Late Republic together as though they were the same or even close? Arguably homosexual relations and pederasty were common in Classical Greece but Spartan women actually had more rights than most of their Hellenic counterparts in all likelihood and it is crazy to say that no Greek or Roman man loved his mother or his sister or his daughter or his wife just off the bat. That statement is made more ludicrous by the examples chosen, because out of every figure they could have chosen, in every culture, they said \"Gee, what Mediterranean culture was into open homosexual relations between compatriots and who exemplifies their acceptance and idealisation of this best?\" And they snapped their fingers and chose the Late Roman Republic. What. And you know I really should not have to say it, but pederasty was not a part of Roman culture, that is not to say that sexual relations between men did not occur but it would in no way have been acceptable for a man's primary sexual or romantic relationship to be with another Roman man. Beyond that, Julius Caesar is not exactly remembered for distancing himself from women, at best it could be theorised that he was bisexual but I am somewhat skeptical of this, not to mention that outside of the Nicomedes bit anecdotes about romantic relations with men are pretty scarce so your guess is as good as mine but we should at least admit that browsing through anecdotal accounts of statements made by long-dead people who had questionable motives is pretty much the only proof that will be forthcoming no matter what stance you take. And of course, Roman society was nowhere near as equitable as our modern standards *but* women had more rights and greater social freedom in Late Republican Rome than they might have elsewhere, although the \"It was a different time\" argument is weak, societies and individuals ought to be judged in context. Really at a certain point I am not even sure what I am arguing against, if the author thinks all men in that period were gay he is wrong, if he is saying women were universally treated as less than people he is wrong, the only point where they touch on anything approaching reality is insofar as women were not treated the same as their male counterparts in antiquity but that is taken way to far and woven into a narrative of unified oppression and gender/racial tensions going back millenia which simply does not exist. Basically, none of those cultures were exactly utopic pictures of egalitarianism where gender and social standing did not shape societal expectations from birth to death but neither were most North African cultures like Egypt, so it is not a European exclusive phenomenon. I would not take so much time arguing this point but the writer is trying to illustrate how African societies were an enlightened, modern example of equity until the bigoted European influence crept in which is ridiculous.\n\nAnd I should not have done it, I feel an overwhelming desire to take it back but I clicked on the link titled [High Tech Jesus](http://www.stewartsynopsis.com/BBC's%20High%20Tech%20Jesus.htm). Click on it.\n\n&gt;Golly Gee!  The noses in the following pictures have been shot off!!!  The history books you used in high school--approved by the local board of education, will tell you Egypt was not invaded by Rome until about 300 BC\n\n300 BCE? Is that a typo from the correct 30 BCE or a mix up with the Macedonian conquest in 332? And in any case the local school board would not be wrong in either of those two cases.\n\nIt is at this point that I have to stop, this site has basically every flavour of bad history imaginable from African empires in the Americas, to African Hebrews, to the Khazar myth, to black US presidents, to the idea that Greek mythology is an allegory of African history.\nI have reached my limit but there are probably at least a few dozen posts worth of material depending on what you are into, for instance I know most of the US history sounds like bollocks but I do not feel confident to post about it, and the same goes for the Medieval and Age of Discovery history, so please if anyone is brave enough to look inside share some more of this.\n\nAll I can say is that I hope you are happy, instead of nitpicking reasonably intelligent articles and videos here I am killing brain cells for twisted amusement. It is a slippery slope and I just hit bedrock. The cold, hard bedrock of racism.\n\nEdited:\n\nFixed some sentences that made more sense in my head but were read to weird and understand.",

        "author": "Xealeon",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/659wn2/imgur_presents_facts_about_vikings/",
        "text": "So I came across [this... thing](http://imgur.com/gallery/IL87w) about Vikings on Imgur which comes complete with a grand total of zero cited sources.  Let's take a look at it.  Also keep in mind this whole thing constantly says 'Vikings' when it means 'Scandinavians' but that's pretty par for the course.\n\n&gt;Erik the Red was so violent that fellow Vikings rejected him. He was exiled from both Norway and Iceland\n\nWhile it's true that Erik was banished from Iceland [for murdering a guy](http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/explorers-travelers-and-conquerors-biographies/eric-red#3404702026) it was actually his father, Thorvald Asvaldsson, who was banished from Norway [for similar reasons.](http://discovermagazine.com/2000/mar/featvanished)  I also can't find any mention of him being super duper violent but I guess it's subjective.\n\n&gt;&lt;Description of brutal torture method know as the 'Blood Eagle'&gt;\n\nWhile I can't find anything definitive there is a lot of controversy around whether this was a thing that ever happened with one [source](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/ehr/XCIX/CCCXCI/10.1093_ehr_XCIX.CCCXCI.332/1/332.pdf?Expires=1492477377&amp;Signature=ExhdqXNAmF6lWJlwuy7gf2b5TnKLR2l~9CUdXCqXyRIOddbj3T8XYzoX~V9OVwMQJzZp0tkOe82a-aerbVlM3kHOx26aogwyamKy43KgMW7t0o0julEbmQjMSIxbAo8QX7xA3lFIGsuXaWuz~WG7B14lIkVyl63o1~9IvrV34Be8C4wsnDat8BJcyIjhSJd2mzRJoKpIPpbpuvRDy2eGt4TwZWRbfPKCQ5eGthtWnf9SEbZuNZkHdae13n8zkaxNt8tWywe4jymSn9tZCrXOqC2w1R3U7gA9Rh1vPJWE3QBIm1IrWDqed2h0o1sZtqgPI~4rYEKrmZu17UafyL~srw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q) saying:\n\n&gt;Descriptions of the sacrifice start only in the late twelfth century. In the course of the next two hundred years Scandinavian authors associate the blood-eagle with four individuals. Two of the victims are historical figures from the ninth century: Ella and Halfdan; in both cases, the accounts of Saxo and the sagas are contradicted — sometimes flagrantly — by contemporary sources.  The remaining two victims are from the world of legend\n\nSo at best it's not all that common, certainly not as common as the image suggests.\n\n&gt;Disputes were settled using a system known as 'Holmgangs,' which was essentially a duel to the death.  If somebody felt a fellow Viking had wronged his family he would challenge them.  The event was to be held within a week of the challenge, and rules varied from region to region.\n\nSo it's true that Holmgangs were a thing but the image seems to be implying that they were *the* method for solving disputes when, in fact, [this source](http://www.stavacademy.co.uk/mimir/holmgang.htm) presents a quote:\n\n&gt;\"The right of settling a legal dispute by ...combat was a neutralizing influence at the uncertainty of Icelandic law. It was a shield against the dominating principle of Formalism, and as a means of deliverance from the ...false oath of an opponent ...it was a ready means for ...settlement of the ...issue, and was ...a[n] ...answer to any ...legal chicanery.\"\n\nwhich implies that the Holmgang was intended as a sort of work-around for the existing legal system.  Also it's not necessarily a fight to the death (Iceland, specifically, went to first blood) nor is it specifically a resolution for a 'wronged family'.\n\nThe picture used for 'Berserkers' is of [Celtic Warriors](http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/fighting-buff-did-celtic-warriors-really-go-war-naked-007857).\n\n&gt;They filed their teeth into points to further petrify their enemies.\n\nFirst of all, I can clearly see in that image that those teeth are not pointed.  Come on, man.  Second, [this source](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0203_060203_viking_teeth_2.html) states:\n\n&gt;Why the Viking men had their teeth modified remains a mystery, but it's likely that the marks represented some kind of achievement.\n\nAlso it's not really strictly badhistory, it's just baffling but\n\n&gt;Often times, their longboats were not built with bathrooms.\n\nAs opposed to all those other viking-era boats that did come with bathrooms?\n\n&gt;Being covered in the blood of enemies must have had some sort of mental effect on Vikings as they are known throughout history to be incredibly clean.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how those two statements are related since it's not like Vikings were covered in the blood of their enemies so constantly that it would effect their ideas of cleanliness.\n\n&gt;When the Norse vikings sailed for America in the 11th century, they fully expected (and hoped) to find a race of monsters to fight.  Instead they found the indigenous peoples.  Disappointed at finding no real monsters, the Norse (known for being tall) called them Skræling, or pygmies.\n\nOh, so now they're Norse Vikings instead of just Vikings.  I cannot find any sources to support this idea, either, it seems like they were travelling there [to settle and gather valuable resources.](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/North_American_exploration.htm)  Also it seems the Norse name for the natives was skrælingjar which could possibly mean 'coarse fellows' or 'subhumans'.",

Barring the fact that this is an incredibly weak comparison, there are a number of truly badhistory things in his speech, like here:\n\n1. In the first line, Spicer states that \"we [the US] didn't use chemical weapons in World War II\". While yes, it is true that officially the Allies did not use chemical weapons, there was, in fact, an [accidental release of mustard gas after the Germans bombed a US ship carrying it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare#Accidental_release), killing numerous Americans and Italians. In fact, throughout the entire war, the Allies kept their chemical weapon stockpiles prepared for an attack, and constantly manufactured lethal agents with plans of using them. Yes, the US did not use them in the end, but that is only a part of the story.\n\n2. Of course, Spicer soon states that \"Hitler didn't even sink in to using chemical weapons\". This is, obviously, a lie. Not only did the Nazis use carbon monoxide and Zyklon B extremely liberally in death camps and gas chambers against innocent Jews, Roma and other victims, but even the idea that the Nazis did not use chemical warfare is a lie. [Quoting Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare#Nazi_Germany): *\"The Nazis did use chemical weapons in combat on several occasions along the Black Sea, notably in Sevastopol, where they used toxic smoke to force Russian resistance fighters out of caverns below the city, in violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol. The Nazis also used asphyxiating gas in the catacombs of Odessa in November 1941, following their capture of the city, and in late May 1942 during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula in eastern Crimea. Victor Israelyan, a Soviet ambassador, reported that the latter incident was perpetrated by the Wehrmacht's Chemical Forces and organized by a special detail of SS troops with the help of a field engineer battalion. Chemical Forces General Ochsner reported to German command in June 1942 that a chemical unit had taken part in the battle. After the battle in mid-May 1942, roughly 3,000 Red Army soldiers and Soviet civilians not evacuated by sea were besieged in a series of caves and tunnels in the nearby Adzhimuskai quarry. After holding out for approximately three months, \"poison gas was released into the tunnels, killing all but a few score of the Soviet defenders.\" Thousands of those killed around Adzhimushk were documented to have been killed by asphyxiation from gas.\"*. Obviously, the Eastern Front and it's atrocities do not exist to most Americans, WW2 is clearly just a bunch of heroic Americans kicking evil Nazi ass, so this major mistake is understandable.\n\n3. Later, Spicer tries to correct himself, knowing that his earlier quip will be misinterpreted, and tried to explain that \"Hitler didn't use it on people in cities, but rather in Holocaust centers\". Barring the fact that the non-usage of gas in WW2 has been disproven, Spicer apparently forgets about the existence of death camps, or at least their name, calling them \"Holocaust centers\". No, Mr. Spicer, a holocaust center is a memorial and museum for learning about the genocide and explore it's history, and I'm pretty sure they do not gas Jews to death.\n\n---\n\nSource: Wikipedia is enough to disprove this lowball.",

        "text": "'ullo, there.\n\nI spent a few days trying to write this up in a way that could be submitted to r/history. Unfortunately the core argument of the document I'm going to discuss is history has been misrepresented, perhaps deliberately, by Molony. They even suggest that the experts in the program were edited to agree with his conclusions. I don't think I can do anything that won't end up violating one of their rules. This post may glance over the points too quickly, but I am attempting to compress a 20-page document that’s responding to an hour-long (and horrifically edited) documentary. If you have suggestions on how to improve, please give me that advice.\n\n\nAnyways, [here's](http://wormstedt.com/Titanic/TITANIC-FIRE-AND-ICE-Article.pdf) a document that is a point-by-point refutation of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrN28FB_JnU) documentary. I'll go over it briefly, but I encourage you to read the document. It's not too long and it's written by members of the Titanic historical community who have contributed the [most](https://www.amazon.ca/Titanic-Ship-Magnificent-Slip-Case/dp/0752447408) significant [literature](https://www.amazon.ca/Report-into-Loss-Titanic-Reappraisal/dp/0752462105/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1491827380&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mark+chirnside) on the subject in the last few decades. I don't take their opinions lightly.\n\n\nThe [mark](http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/01/03/a21088b3-dc02-48bb-bda2-81d49a383939/resize/620x/708bb710faa23a9627b23256b5981adf/phillips-titanic-fire-0103-transfer2.jpg) that forms the basis of Molony's theory does not show up in [other](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IWx1a4s9Jvk/Umhl7o7WqlI/AAAAAAAAAOY/-XtfemE0HSM/s1600/Titanic+at+Southampton+Dock.jpg) photographs of Titanic taken in the [same time frame.](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/community/attachments/titanichull1-png.2301/) Such an illusion is also present on Olympic in the same area when no coal fire is known to have taken place (look into the PDF for a clear example). It's most likely caused by the curvature of the hull meeting the flat side or an imperfection in the photograph. This area is also [50 feet away](https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMhXf2Y51WwXHL-qqMesy-oduMb1hDgQRZ0Wg3B) from the [coal bunker in question.](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/community/attachments/coalhull-png.2295/) In fact, the ship's pool is right above the coal bunker and against the bulkhead that was supposed to be deformed, but [no such deformation](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/d9/bf/4c/d9bf4c8b3cd159f6b5f8605d56d3882c.jpg) was present when Titanic left Southampton.\n\n\nThe critics also state the documentary overstated the severity and duration of the fire. Molony more or less states the fire was out of control and would have stopped Titanic from leaving had the Board of Trade inspectors known about it. This ignores the conditions on those ships provided an opportunity for coal to spontaneously combust meaning coal fires were common and weren't the greatest concern. The BoT gave testimony that they would not have stopped Titanic from leaving because of this. His statements also ignore testimony that states the fire had been taken care of by the end of April 13th, a day before Titanic struck the iceberg.\n\n\nThe doc claims the head designer, Thomas Andrews, gave a much longer time for Titanic to founder before the bulkhead around the coal bunker failed. There is only one account of his behaviour given and it says nothing of the sort. Andrews stated immediately after assessing his ship that she had at most 2 hours left (he was almost exactly right), well before anything suggesting a failed bulkhead.\n\n\nMolony furthermore asserts this was all covered up, in conjunction with the sub-par materials that no doubt caused a premature failure of the hull, the watertight bulkhead and ultimately the entire structure of the ship. They do this by misrepresenting testimony and company documents regarding the materials, or even coming up with conversations wholesale such as Ismay demanding thinner materials and Andrews being forced to comply. They wished to keep stress to 10 tons psi, as did any shipbuilder working with mild steel, on the structure which they managed to get in at 9.9. The thickness of the material had already been set before Ismay visited the dockyards and there is nothing suggesting he requested thinner plating. In fact, in some areas, the ship was strengthened with extra plating making it several inches thick.\n\n\nThe materials were also up to standard and right on par, even sometimes above, with contemporary vessels. When asked, Andrews was cordial and professional, not uptight as the editing of the documentary suggests.\n\n\nIn the end, the fact of the matter is no material at the time could stand up to 52,000 tons moving at 25 miles an hour being ground up against an iceberg. Titanic was not an icebreaker and 6 compartments were damaged right off the bat because of this, most nowhere near the fire. If the fire played any role at all, it was minimal and would not have made a difference.\n\n\nThank you so much for your patience and have a wonderful day. After all, it is the 105th anniversary of Titanic leaving Southampton. Formatting and links edited in.",

If that was the definition Bill Warner was going by, then he would have to include a map of all armed conflicts that defended or advanced christendom. It seems that has decided to use one definition for wars fought by muslims; which includes all battles fought by muslim powers, not only \"holy\" wars. He must however have chosen antother defintion to wars fought by christians, as he only includes the crusades, which is  considered \"holy\" wars. It seems clear to me that he intentionally does this to somehow frame islam as a more \"historically\" violent religion than christendom, when this simply is'nt true. The militarly expansions in Europe, America, Asia and Africa led by christian nations would also have to be included in his video, as they furthers christian powers, for this video to be an accurate historical representation.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/64cz71/anyone_but_richard_iii_murdered_the_princes_in/",
        "text": "np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/64a5xf/did_richard_iii_really_murder_his_nephews/\n\nThis video was submitted to r/history and claims that Henry Stafford, duke of Buckingham was the man that murdered the Princes in the Tower. Richard III was, of course, unaware of all this because Richard Can Do No Wrong. It also has some serious bad history in it. \n\n2:00: \"Henry Stafford, second duke of Buckingham was an obscure noble... had major resentment towards Elizabeth Woodville and Edward IV\" \n\nBuckingham was not an 'obscure' noble, no duke can be considered 'obscure'. He was close to Richard soon after Edward IV's death in April 1483. It was Buckingham and Richard together that seized custody of Edward V at Stony Stratford on 30th April that year, imprisoning his Woodville escort and beginning the sequence of events that culminated in Richard's usurpation.\n\nThere's also little evidence of Buckingham bearing a grudge against Elizabeth Woodville and her family. He was married to the queen's sister, Katherine, and had been raised in the Woodville household. One of the leading Woodville magnates, the earl Rivers, even appointed Buckingham a feoffee to some of his estates shortly before Edward IV's death in 1483. Dominic Mancini's account of the usurpation of Richard does claim that Buckingham resented his in-laws as the marriage to Katherine Woodville meant he missed out on a more profitable marriage into the Neville family. However, Mancini's account is retrospective so this may be a later attempt to read back his motives. It is possible he begrudged Edward IV for his seeming political exclusion in the late 1470s, however.\n\n2:35: \"It is unlikely that Richard would have been stupid enough to order the murder of the Princes without official reason for their deaths to present to the public. But, it is possible that Stafford, being so consumed with vengeance, would make this blunder.\" \n\nThe idea that Richard would not have ordered the Princes' deaths without a reason to present to the public is very dubious. Edward II, Richard II, and Henry VI were all likely murdered after their deposition, but their deaths were never presented as such to the public. One Yorkist propaganda tract, The Arivall of Edward the Fourth, claims that Henry VI died from 'pure displeasure and melancholy'. If any one person was directly responsible for the Princes' execution, it was probably James Tyrell, a close associate of Richard who supposedly confessed to the murder before his execution in 1502.\n\n2:55: \"following his exile, Stafford joined the rebellion against Richard III. Keen argues that this rebellion was initially to rescue the boys in the Tower, but when Stafford joined the rebellion shifted its focus to support Henry Tudor.\"\n\nBuckingham's Rebellion was unlikely to be intended to install Henry Tudor as king. No immediately contemporary sources specify Henry as the rebel's candidate, it instead appears to have been an attempt to restore Edward V to power. Only later sources identify Henry as being important to this rebellion. The Yorkist exiles did not even officially endorse Henry until Christmas Day 1483, almost two months after Buckingham's execution and the end of the rebellion. It was probably during or after this rebellion that the Princes were killed.\n\nFinally, the whole thesis of the video is unsupportable. Richard had almost no reason to keep the Princes alive and every reason to kill them. They had been disinherited and publicly besmirched as illegitimate. Richard couldn't use them as heirs, doing so would be admitting their claim, one superior to his. However, if they were kept alive they'd act as a focus for rebellion, as they did for a plot in July 1483 and Buckingham's Rebellion later that year.\n\nIn short, if Richard ordered the Princes' deaths, he was a murderer, if he didn't, he was an exceptionally foolish king.\n\nSources:\n\nC.

Way before bombs were invented, not that simple.\"\n\nConveniently ignoring the fact Baghdad was a leading world-city, a hub of commerce and learning across Europe and ~~NEMA~~ MENA, and the capital of arguably the most-powerful political entity at the time, from the 8th to 10th centuries...\n\nThe [House of Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom), founded in the 8th century, was a place of learning. Scholars from across the Caliphate and beyond were invited to study and share their knowledge at the House. The institute was dedicated to the dissemination of knowledge. To that end Christian scholars based at the House translated the works of the ancient Greeks, Syriacs, Persians, and Indians. The translated works included those by Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Euclid, Plotinus, Galen, Sushruta, Charaka, Aryabhata and Brahmagupta to name but a few. The impact of the House of Wisdom on Western society is staggering. It was in large part thanks to the House's translations that works by Plato, Aristotle, and others often considered the 'founding philosophers of western society' were reintroduced to Europe following the collapse of the Roman Empire and the fragmentation of the early middle ages.\n\nThe scholar al-Khwarizmi, one of the founding fathers of algebra, was based at the House of Wisdom. The word *algorithm* derives directly from the latinized form of his name, *Algoritmi*. The scholar Ibn al-Haytham, also based at the House, is considered one of the first theoretic physicists and, while he never formalized his theory, was an early proponent of what would come to be known as the scientific method. He was given Scholastic honors by late medieval European society with the epithet Ptolemaeus Secundus, the Second Ptolemy.\n\nThis intellectual paradise was brought to an abrupt and final end at the hands of the Mongols, when it was sacked and destroyed during the Siege of Baghdad in 1258. The legend of the Library of Alexandria and the ancient knowledge lost in its destruction has been romanticized. If any singular episode of destruction should have such a reputation, it is not the loss of the Library of Alexandria, but of the House of Wisdom. ",

        "text": "Today's post brought to you by a Facebook group that is meant to be for fashion historians to network, but frequently is used by people who like antique clothing to share pretty pictures et cetera. I've seen David James's \"Five Minute History\" website linked there several times, always terrible, so I'm just going to do a big post on multiple episodes of bad fashion history there.\n\nThe most recent article to frustrate me is [A 5-Minute Guide to the House of Worth](http://fiveminutehistory.com/a-5-minute-guide-to-the-house-of-worth/):\n\n&gt;Something wonderful happened to the world of fashion during the second half of the 19th century. Beautiful gowns were no longer the exclusive privilege of the aristocracy but were available to anyone with the wherewithal to display their finery on the boulevards, in the opera houses, and in café society. [...] And who was responsible for this change? None other than the English entrepreneur Charles Frederick Worth, “the father of Haute Couture”.\n\nThis is an incredibly bad statement that I only barely understand. Non-aristocratic women with money were able to buy beautiful gowns before Worth, and much of Worth's clientele were aristocratic women anyway. Possibly the issue is that James doesn't realize that \"the father of haute couture\" refers to the way that Worth is positioned as having created developments that changed fashion merchandising, advertising, etc. and became core elements of the modern fashion industry. (Although [I would argue that this is greatly overstated](http://mimic-of-modes.blogspot.com/2016/02/re-evaluating-c-frederick-worth.html).) It doesn't mean that there was no fashion industry before him.\n\n&gt;Establishing a reputation for himself and winning commendations at the expositions in Paris and London, news of Worth’s skills caught the attention of the Empress Eugénie, wife of Emperor Napoleon III of France. Appointed court designer, Charles Frederick Worth’s success was all but guaranteed. Soon after, he opened his own design house in Paris at 7 Rue de la Paix—first in partnership with Otto Bobergh and later as sole proprietor.\n\nThis timeline is completely borked. Worth found success with dresses he showed at Maison Gagelin, the department store where he worked, which led to him leaving to form Worth &amp; Bobergh in 1858; the Princess von Metternich was an early client, and Eugénie found out about them from her in 1860 and at some subsequent point made him her official dressmaker.\n\nThis is stuff you can find accurate information for on Wikipedia, because the historical couturier pages have been really thoroughly done (even if I don't fully agree with some of the conclusions and think even some of the sources are suspect). So I'm not sure how he's managing to be this off.\n\nI'd also note that the portrait he uses to illustrate this point, which he labeled *Portrait of the Empress Eugénie [...], 1853, wearing a gown designed by Worth*, cannot actually show Eugénie in a Worth gown **since Worth wasn't making gowns for her or possibly anyone but his wife in 1853**. (He might have gotten the erroneous info from [this random page](http://theredlist.com/wiki-2-23-1249-1250-view-before-1900-profile-charles-frederick-worth-4.html).)\n\n&gt; The House of Worth and Haute Couture were born. Haute Couture is the fusion of fashion and costume. It is wearable art.\n\n??? Haute couture literally means \"high sewing\", and it refers to very high-end, bespoke clothing made with exquisite attention to detail and a certain amount of customization from the original models. It's got nothing to do with costume, and very high-end fashion pre-Worth was also wearable art.\n\nAt the end of the page, he's just dumped a huge number of photos of Worth gowns from the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection. Which isn't wrong (except for the one 1870s outfit inexplicably labeled as 1894 and stuck in that part of the timeline), since the Met put those photos in the public domain, but it's kind of a cheat to bulk out the post.\n\nLet's jump to another favorite topic of mine: [10 Facts About the Victorian Tradition of White Weddings](http://fiveminutehistory.com/10-facts-about-the-victorian-tradition-of-white-weddings/)!\n\n&gt;1) White weddings started with Queen Victoria\n\n&gt;Although Queen Victoria was not the first monarch to wear white at her wedding, she is credited with starting the tradition of a white wedding when she chose to wear a white wedding dress to marry Prince Albert in 1840.\n\nThis is again a total borking — the opposite is true. Queen Victoria did not start the tradition of wearing a white wedding dress: she was the first royal to wear white instead of silver. For instance, [Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, Princess of Wales, painted by Charles Philips in her wedding dress](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Augusta_of_Saxe-Gotha,_Princess_of_Wales_by_Charles_Philips.jpg). They and their bridesmaids often incorporated white into their outfits as an accent, or as a ground for silver work (mainly royal bridesmaids), or as the main color of their traveling dress — George IV's daughter, Princess Charlotte, had a silver-embroidered net wedding dress over an underdress of white and silver satin, and then had an after-party dress of \"rich white silk\" and a going-away pelisse of white satin, trimmed with ermine.\n\n&gt;2) Wearing white was unusual at the time of her wedding\n\n&gt;At the time of Queen Victoria’s wedding, wearing white was considered unusual, but in less than a decade, it was being proclaimed as a long-standing tradition. \n\nVery much not the case. It was considered unusual for a queen or princess to wear white because that was an *ordinary* woman's wedding color. In the novel *Pamela*, by Samuel Richardson (1741), Pamela wears white to be married. So does Harriet Byron in *Sir Charles Grandison*. So do a good handful of brides in stories printed in the 18th century *Lady's Magazine*. So does the bride in Hogarth's [first *Marriage-à-la-Mode* painting](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/william-hogarth-marriage-a-la-mode-1-the-marriage-settlement), and the bride in his [painting of the wedding of Stephen Beckingham and Mary Cox](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/36.111/). In the early 19th century, a white lace gown over a white satin slip becomes more fashionable (still white). There are a number of fashion plates in the 1820s and 1830s labeled \"wedding dress\" that show white silk and lace.\n\nWhite was very, very usual, and it was proclaimed a long-standing tradition soon after her marriage **because it actually was one**.\n\nThe rest of this piece isn't very objectionable, so let's move to what I *know* everyone was hoping for when they clicked the link: [Ooh la la! The Victorian Secret – How to Get Into Shape in Just 5-Minutes With No Exercise](http://fiveminutehistory.com/ooh-la-la-the-victorian-secret-how-to-get-into-shape-in-just-5-minutes/).\n\n&gt;Being an innovative lot, the Victorians over-engineered the corset to reduce waist size down to an incredibly small 16″ (40cm). (The smallest waist in recorded history was that of Ethel Granger at 13″ (33cm) ).\n\nThe smallest waistlines we see in extant dresses are about 20\", and we see these on dresses that are (I have said/typed this so many times in my life, and I'm only 29) overall quite small, with busts and hips around 30\". Essentially a modern American size zero. Are they still getting reduction from the corset? Yes, but not that many inches. People like to say that Victorian women generally were reduced to 20\" or less by corsets because it implies that even women who would be average-sized today would have had to do so, losing 10\" or more, which seems exotic and scary and exciting. **Outside of Victorian fetish literature, few women practiced noticeable tight-lacing.** You know why everybody thinks all women tried to get a 16\" waist? Because of freaking *Gone With the Wind*.\n\nEthel Granger was born after the Victorian era ended, and practiced fetishistic waist training in the 20th century, so she's pretty irrelevant here. Note that according to the Vogue article he links to at this point says that her natural waist was about 24\" when she began training.\n\n&gt;But our story begins with a powerful Italian lady by the name of Catherine de’ Medici. When Catherine became Queen of France in 1547 (as the wife of Henry II of France, she required everyone attending court to sport a slim waistline.\n\nNo! No no no! Catherine has been turned into a vicious harpy by history, due to a certain extent to her being a powerful female regent and to her part in allowing the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre to begin. There's no evidence at all that Catherine de' Medici forced her court ladies to tightlace (usually the waistline given as required is 13\") — it comes from oral tradition and really bad early fashion history books. It doesn't make a lot of sense, especially considering as she had very little power until after her husband's death; I don't think she could have enforced this edict at all.\n\n&gt;The French Revolution threatened to wipe the corset from the annals of history when the “Empire Silhouette” came into fashion. Thanks to Napoleon’s first Empress, Joséphine de Beauharnais, the high-waisted appearance with long, flowing skirt became popular across Europe.\n\nPeople get so invested in having individual figures to pin changes in fashion to. In this case, there's again no evidence that Joséphine had anything to do with the popularization of the Neoclassical style; it arose in architecture and furniture in the 1770s, starting trickling into fashion in the 1780s, and fully took hold around 1795.\n\nAnother thing people get invested in is the idea that Neoclassical/Regency fashion banished the corset. It didn't. While a few very fashionable French women in the late 1790s were conspicuously painted in filmy dresses and without corsets or even chemises, most women continued to wear shorter versions of 18th century stays; these developed cups sort of like those on a modern bra, and then a [totally new form](http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/a-wedding-corset-74890) came about, which was essentially a rectangle, shaped with triangles added into slits at the top and bottom. Far from being threatened, a corset was necessary for most women to achieve the \"Empire\" figure, with a lifted bust and smoothed-down stomach.\n\n&gt;By 1850, steel was used for boning and eyelets, allowing corsets to be laced very tightly indeed. In fashionable London, tight lacing was a serious affair—even for one’s teenaged daughters. An article in the New York Times read: \"*…tight lacing is fashionable again. One of the most exclusive corsetieres in Oxford Street, who is the authority for the statement, said today: We are on the verge of another tiny-waist craze.* [...]\"\n\nThe thing about tight-lacing in textual sources is that writing about it has *always* been, as it is now, a way to insert both salaciousness and superiority. Look at those unnamed women I totally talked to in real life! Imagine how incredibly sexual they appear! Yet they're also degraded by how much they want to be sexual!/Yet they're being forced to be so sexual, how we pity them! Writers — usually male ones — were complaining about it in periods where it wasn't even quite possible, given the construction materials and methods used, like the 1820s and 1830s. Descriptions of tight-lacing in magazines and newspapers are unverifiable and tell us more about views on sexuality/corsetry/etc. than actual practices.\n\nTo be fair, some of the fashion articles on the site are bland and anodyne, but on the whole I wish this guy would stop writing about a subject that he knows so little about.",

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers I was unsuccessful in yet another job interview and felt the need to drown my sorrows, so I thought it an opportune time for a Badhistory review. This time I am focusing on another documentary from the  ̶F̶a̶n̶t̶a̶s̶y̶ History Channel. This one is called Modern Marvels: Barbarian Battle Tech (because when I think of modern marvels, I think of weapons made 2000 years ago):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eY44P1GXt8\n\nOf course, I had to choose an alcohol that represents destructive behavior and low intellect, so it had to be something imbibed by European soccer fans. For this reason I settled upon Jägermeister. So let us begin!\n\n0.40: Narrator references a fictional character as if he existed. DRINK!\n\n0.50: Ah, the classic reference to Barbarians being harsh and savage. Let’s ignore the extensive trade routes, growing urbanization and participatory forms of government (depending on the culture), willingness to adopt new ideas, and exceptionally refined artistic traditions (especially for the Celts).\n\n1.07: These is no way that guy's sword is accurate to the general time period of 500 BC to 500 AD. The curved crossguard, pommel and general shape make it appear to be at least at type XIV according to Oakshott:\n\nhttp://www.thearma.org/spotlight/oakeshott_typology.html#.WOYBuelMSUk\n\nThis would mean the sword is at, the very least, 700 years too early. DRINK!\n\n1.54: The narrator states the Iron Age began in 1200 BC and ended in 500 AD. Whilst the start date is generally correct, attaching an end date is ludicrious as iron was still a key metal for many, many centuries, with cast iron being an important element in industrialisation 1200 years later. DRINK!\n\n2.24: \"The British Museum in London plays host to Barbarian weapons once wielded in the fury of combat\". As opposed to those wielded in the gentility of combat.\n\n2.59: The narrator states that iron changed the face of ancient combat. Whilst iron was cheaper, more widespread and so allowed larger armies to be recruited, it did not actually alter the nature of combat itself, which remained relatively consistent in terms of techniques. Close-order formations were still practiced, spears were still the most common weapon, and cavalry was still dominant in open areas. DRINK!\n\n3.09: And here we see some sport fans from Glasgow prior to the start of a game.\n\n3.19: The map shows the areas the Celts dominated in 800 BC, but includes Galatia in  ̶T̶u̶r̶k̶e̶y̶ the area that would become Byzantine Anatolia and will eventually be returned to its rightful owners, and they did not settle there till after 280 BC. Likwise the Celts did not expand into the Balkans until 500 years after the aforementioned date. DRINK!\n\n4.08: I still maintain that any historical expert whom appears in a documentary needs to have a British accent in order to appear credible.\n\n6.12: \"You didn't want to be sticking it into your opponent\". Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n7.22: The narrator calls Celtic-style hillforts a unique system. Indeed, it was so unique it was used by every other culture in Europe and Asia. All societies established fortifications in geographically favourable locations (such as on hill or rocky out-crops). The Thracians are mentioned as retreating to such redoubts, and the Persians mantained garrisons in similar places in Anatolia. DRINK!\n\n7.44: \"Its over Caesar, I have the high ground!\". \"You underestimate my dignitas!\".\n\n9.49: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!\n\n10.02: This is what London looks like after the English lose the World Cup.\n\n10.09: Mo like Queen Booty-ca, amirite?\n\n10.12: REPLAY OF SAME SCENE OF HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!\n\n10.26: The narrator calls the Celtic chariot an example of Barbarian technology, even though it had been utilized by advanced states in the Middle-East over a thousand years previoulsy. DRINK!\n\n11.33: Mike Loades! This earns the ByzantineBasileus Seal of Approval (tm).\n\n16.27: The narrator states the Huns came with a devastating weapon, the recurve bow. This was essentially a composite bow, and was something the Romans had encountered hundreds of years before, first in their interactions with Greece, and then as they fought the Parthians and others in the Middle-East. The Romans also incorporated the weapon into their own military system. It is more accurate to say the Huns introduced an improved variation of the bow, rather than having a completely new weapon. DRINK!\n\n17.05: The narrator asserts that the Hunnic bow was in strict contrast to the long-bow or self-bow used in Europe. Again, incorrect. As I mentioned previously, the composite bow was well known in Europe as it was adopted by the Roman army, and also became common amongst Roman cavalry who functioned as horse-archers from the 4th century AD onwards. DRINK!\n\n18.23: Legend has it that if an arrow reached 88 miles an hour it could go back in time and kill your opponent.\n\n19.40: PLAGIARIZING FROM AN OLIVER STONE MOVIE ALERT!\n\n20.15: The narrator explains that the Huns introduced new tactics onto the battlefield. The Parthian had utilized skirmishing tactics with mounted archers to defeat the Romans way back in 53 BC at Carrhae, and the Romans had fought other nomadic peoples like the Sarmatians. There was nothing revolutionary about existing Hunnic approaches to battle. DRINK!\n\nAnd that is all for now. See you for part two!\n\nSources\n\nThe Ancient Celts, by Barry Cunliffe\n\nThe Composite Bow, by Mike Loades and Peter Dennis\n\nFrom Sumer to Rome: The Military Capabilities of Ancient Armies, by Richard A.

On top of that, the Ottoman empire was ruled by a Sultan, not a Caliph.  I believe that during WWI the Ottoman Emperor claimed the mantle of Caliph to try and rally Muslims to their cause but my memory is a little hazy on the details there.  Also the Ottoman Empire was not governed by Sharia Law but by a combination of Sharia Law and [Kanun](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/24365067).\n\nEDIT: u/solamyas pointed out some inaccuracies so here's a quick correction for the above part:  The Ottoman Empire did become a Caliphate although the rulers seem to have still been titled Sultan which I find confusing and each religious group in the Empire would have had their own religious law alongside the Kanuns, Sharia Law would have been specifically for Muslims.\n\n&gt;The entire reason behind the crusades and the Catholic church's insanity during the Dark Ages was because they were scared shitless that the Ottoman Empire (and Islam in general) would invade Europe and rape/kill everyone there (their response was wrong, but their reasoning was justified).\n\nFirst, Dark Ages.  Second, the First Crusade is launched in 1096, the Ottoman Empire comes to power in the 13th century.  That is one slow crusade. Third, according to *The Crusades* by Thomas Asbridge:\n\n&gt; ...it is important to recognise that, in reality, the notion of conflict with the Muslim world was not written into the DNA of crusading. ...In some ways his choice of Islam as an enemy was almost incidental\n\nand while Pope Urban II did use inflammatory rhetoric about Muslim atrocities in the Levant to incite fervor for the Crusades it wasn't really the true reason behind them.\n\n&gt;The Armenian genocide, where over 2 million Christians were brutally executed by Muslims for no apparent reason other than their religion, has been completely buried.\n\nAccording to [this source:](http://www.armenian-genocide.org/genocidefaq.html)\n\n&gt;Moreover, ideologists such as Zia Gokalp propagandized through the media on behalf of the CUP by promoting Pan-Turanism, the creation of a new empire stretching from Anatolia into Central Asia whose population would be exclusively Turkic. These concepts justified and popularized the secret CUP plans to liquidate the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSo while there was probably a religious component that's certainly not the whole story.  Also, completely buried? *Really?*\n\nLet me know if I missed anything or made any mistakes.",

However, this jumps out:\n\n&gt;America, at the head of white people, led the global abolitionist movement that ended the mainstream practice of slavery...AMERICA IS THE ONE WHO ENDED SLAVERY AND ESTABLISHED WORKERS RIGHTS, NOT THE MIDDLE EAST, NOT AFRICA, NOT ASIA, AND NOT EUROPE! \n\nBefore we begin, a quibble: our friend treats \"America\" as signifying only the USA, whilst Africa, Asia, and Europe are treated as monolithic blocs.\n\nNow, on to the meat and drink of the badhistory:\n\nFrom the context, it seems our friend means by \"the mainstream practice of slavery\", he means the transatlantic  trade.  In neither case can any single country take credit for \"ending slavery\".  However, there are several countries which certainly made far greater efforts, and earlier, to divest themselves of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.  I will focus on the most obvious one, the United Kingdom:\n\n- Slavery was held to be contrary to the law of England by the House of Lords in *[Somerset v Stewart](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/rights/slave_free.htm)* (1772) 98 ER 499.  Scotland's Court of Session would follow suit with an even stronger judgement in *[Knight v Wedderburn](http://webarchive.nrscotland.gov.uk/20170106021747/http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/071022.asp)* (1778) which formally ruled that slavery could not exist in Scotland.  The result was that slavery was abolished on the island of Great Britain when the United States was only two years old.  \n- The British delayed in emancipating the slaves throughout their Empire, however, until the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which came into force in 1834.  The East India Company hung on in Ceylon and St Helena until 1843, but again, still ahead of the US.\n- The United Kingdom, via the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron,[ led a military campaign against the slave trade from 1808 until the 1860s.](https://www.nmrn.org.uk/research/slavery)\n- Slavery was totally abolished throughout the British Empire 20 years before the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nI focus on Britain not to valorise the kindly British at the expense of the wicked Americans^^1, but to demonstrate that A: the United States did not \"lead the global abolitionist movement\", nor was the United States \"the one who ended slavery\", and B: that the United Kingdom was already engaged in the suppression of the slave trade before the ~~War of Southern Treason~~ American Civil War even began.  Britain's history is also the nation with which I am most familiar - however, I would note that France abolished slavery throughout her colonies in 1794, reinstated it in 1802 (thanks Boney!), and finally abolished it five years after Britain in 1848.  Denmark banned the slave trade in 1803 and abolished the practice in 1848.  In Haiti, slaves defeated their masters and established an independent state from 1804.  It is depressing that so few people, even today, seem to consider the fact that many slaves freed themselves.\n\nNobody ended slavery \"at the head of white people\", either.  The majority of Planet Earth's white people didn't directly participate in slavery to begin with, some did, other white people argued for and profited from it, and other white people argued against it and still others fought to abolish it (among dozens of other competing motivations).  The idea of a worldwide white peoples' anti-slavery crusade, led by Uncle Sam, is fantastical. \n\n&gt;All the other countries often take credit for crap they didn't do, or only got into after we started it, and demonize us for acknowledging our past. It really pisses me off tbh, and is one of the only things that can make me want to physically hurt a person. We apologize all the time for our mistakes, have liberated many oppressed societies from their own greed, and yet several other countries in the world still do the same things and haven't shown the slightest remorse, and we're the enemies! GTFO with that Marxist bs. America has done more good for the world than all other countries combined, we apologize relentlessly for the bad things that we did, and yet we have to take the fall for the world's mistakes. It's infuriating.\n\nIf the mods think this is too political then I'll remove it, but I do not understand why some Americans feel that their country is unique in history for acknowledging its mistakes or its racism.  There is no American equivalent, for example, to Germany's *[Vergangenheitsbewältigung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergangenheitsbew%C3%A4ltigung)* (\"coming to terms with the past\").  In fact, given some of the other claims in our man's post (Natives died of disease + cannibalism!), it seems that this particular American is extremely bad at acknowledging his country's mistakes!\n\n---\n\nSources linked in article.\n\n--1.

        "text": "**SPOILERS**\n\nNow I actually like Vikings. I think the acting, plots, and battles are overall pretty good. But by Thor the history is **awful**. So let's take a look at the Season 4 finale! (s4e10, for whatever reason season 4 is split into 2 parts and this episode is the first part's finale.)\n\n[1:50](http://imgur.com/a/Ny5af) Put on a helmet Ragnar\n\n[2:04](http://imgur.com/a/IlEol) Actually everyone in this shot just put on a helmet already\n\n[2:35](http://imgur.com/a/PtJIt) The fuck is that armor\n\n[2:43](http://imgur.com/a/Et1aE) Wait wait wait...are those shields attached to the outside of...the Frankish ships? What?\n\n[2:50](http://imgur.com/a/iJPld) What flag is that supposed to be? It doesn't appear to be Frankish...\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=frankia+flag&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtqbS9kobTAhUm6IMKHQPlDa8Q_AUIBigB&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=894\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=west+frankia+flag&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj74on8kobTAhVj9IMKHanaC0EQ_AUIBigB&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=894#tbm=isch&amp;q=west+francia+flag&amp;*\n\n[5:15](http://imgur.com/a/qcItL) Fire arrows, lol\n\n[5:50](http://imgur.com/a/wcs4U) Ok now what the actual fuck are those ships supposed to be? Now I could be wrong here, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say the Vikings didn't have massive troop carriers specifically built for naval warfare. Sure, there were naval battles, but the idea that the Vikings built massive troop carriers *specifically built for fighting other ships* is **ludicrous**.\n\n[6:20](http://imgur.com/a/570GD) Ey boys, now's the time to actually use those shields, they're not just for decoration you know\n\nAt this point in the episode, we're treated to everyone's favorite trope: the hollywood battle. Instead of two enemies fighting in clearly defined lines and formations, everyone just runs around in a giant rabble of people with absolutely no coordination whatsoever. Good job Michael Hirst 10/10 oscarworthy\n\n[8:15](http://imgur.com/a/jf0fi) Lol at Rollo killing random soldier of his for suggesting a retreat from the battle they're losing. And I thought the show was trying to make us like Rollo, what with a kid on the way and his wife praying for him earlier in the episode. Nevermind his tendency to rape and murder a lot.\n\nAlso I find it hilarious how Rollo's inspiring speech actually works. I mean, I assume the guy he killed was liked by at least some of his troops. Oh well.\n\n[9:38](http://imgur.com/a/BkBOl) There's a subplot of sorts about Ragnar's addiction to these unspecified plants, but as far as I know there aren't any addictive plants that grow anywhere in the Scandinavian region. Could be wrong though.\n\n[11:34](http://imgur.com/a/9W9Y9) And that's why you don't stand straight up in the very front of your boat in the very front of your formation. Also if Rollo is within bow range of Bjorn, why aren't the Vikings firing on the Frankish? The Frankish rowers are completely exposed!\n\nI can't take much more of this. I'll finish the episode later. Probably.\n\nSources: http://www.vikingskip.com/vikingshipclasses.htm\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nwww.yahoo.com\n\nwww.google.com\n\nwww.tubgirl.com",

        "text": "Hello /r/badhistory! I haven't posted in a while, and since we all grow and learn over time, I think it would be worth while to look back at one of my older posts.\n\nI wrote a post regarding CGP Grey, and Guns Germs and Steel using the popular 'snarkily rant at time-stamps and occasionally hotlink some JSTOR articles' method. [Link here](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/44gk0i/grey_germs_and_generalization/)\n\nIn it I claimed many things, such as Meyers Rum being Kosher, and that ***\"*** Historiography ***\"*** is important. Neither of these are true. Since making the post I've learned many things, and with a true understanding of how the world works, thought I'd rebut my rebuttal.\n\nClearly my reference to so called \"experts\" is an appeal to authority, and as such just implies I know nothing, and am a shill for Big History. Layfolk are infinitely more informed on matters than these \"experts\", working with their guts and common sense, rather than \"sources\" or \"Facts.\" And the fact that \"historians\" are \"paid\" to \"write\" \"papers\" means that they're invested in continuing the status-quo, furthering societal understanding of the past, and ensuring that understanding is based in diverse voices, to further reinforce that everyone has agency, *which we know is a lie because there is no free will, as Mr. Grey explained.* Clearly they're just biased and Jared Diamond (PBUH) is the correct one about geographic determinism.^1\n\nI used a diminutive to refer to the esteemed Grey, so that was kinda rude. And it was a slavic diminutive as well! Clearly a communist conspiracy. And I gave him hassle for using BC instead of BCE, when we all know that if Jesus hadn't been born, then he couldn't have given George Washington the Constitution and helped him fight the Commie redcoats. Checkmate atheists.\n\nThen I, in some kind of red-loving commie-shill Zionist fit of degeneracy, claim that there is no narrative to history. This is clearly crap. If there was no narrative to history, than why did America win the Revolution, Space race, two world wars, and the Cold War. Clearly it is manifest destiny for us to move towards an enlightened future. If people in the past weren't dumber than now, why'd they all live in mud huts and get sick? They should have just invented logic, and rationalism. Also feminism is illogical, and communist, which means bad. When you think about it, really think, the Soviets were the good guys in Afghanistan. They were fighting the same Jihadi crazies, and maybe if the damned democrat Charlie Wilson had minded his own business the forces of sanity and rationalism would have won, and 9/11 wouldn't have happened. It's just like the fall of the roman empire.\n\n***\"*** Historiography ***\"*** is clearly a lie. It's been down hill since we stopped learning and teaching about how Great White Men conquered the ignorant savages of the Orient, India, and Darkest Africa with the power of Jesus Christ, Free Market Capitalism, and the sheer force of their masculinity. Those folks ought to be paying *us* for civilizing them. Western civilization *deserved* to take the resources they weren't using in return for giving the ungrateful heathens trousers and strong liquor.\n\nI have no disagreement with \"the UK dominated the history game\" When Arthur was given the sword by the lady of the lake, it was then that the English, with completely willing and not at all coerced help from their other British freinds, were destined to rule the world. Or at least enough of it that America could be created through divine providence, to bring Freedom to the world, or at least the good parts. Because history is a race, and AMERICA IS FUCKING WINNING!\n\nThen this commie pinko says that Historians shouldn't judge the past. Bullshit! They spend all their time judging white people for \"evil shit\" which is mostly liberal buzzwords like \"colonialism\" \"slavery\" \"the Bengal Famine\" \"Sykes-Picot Agreement\" \"The Herero Genocide\" \"The Highland Clearances\" \"Stolen generations\" \"Circus Peanuts\" \"heteronormativity\" \"the patriarchy\" \"The holocaust\" and \"Sir, the phrase 'White Man's Burden' is a metaphor, I can't prescribe you Hydrocodone for back pain from it\". Frankly it's just a bunch of reverse-racism. Today it's ok for historians to hold up the commie revolutionaries in the colonial world as 'fighting for freedom' but when you call the Rhodesians \"patriots fighting for their families\" or try and explain, like my Opa told me, that the average German knew nothing of the Camps, and that the SS was actually an elite, and a-political, fighting force defending European civilization from the Judeo-Bolshevik eastern hordes, they call you \"racist\" and \"uninformed.\" Well, \"HISTORIANS\" if not being a commie makes me an ignorant racist, then I'm as racist and ignorant as they come!\n\nAnyway, past-whatismoo then tries to pull the wool over our eyes, but hold on, I'll correct me! Technological progress is measured by, like, it just is. Come on, if you need me to explain that you're clearly a statist. It's common sense, like that the North was the aggressor in the War-of-Northern-Aggression-Against-A-Peaceful-South-Who-Treated-The-Slaves-Well-More-Like-Family-Really-You-Wouldn't-Mistreat-A-Tractor-Or-A-Horse-So-Why-A-Slave-Plus-Drapetomania-Was-A-Thing-Checkmate-Atheists. Oh, and the inca used wheels only in childrens toys because they were dumb. Seriously, *wheels* that's basic shit, like written language. Oh, they also didn't have that? Clearly a product of reduced brain capacity as a result of too much time at altitude.\n\nBeing reductive isn't a bad thing at all, it's a great way to make big things easy to understand. I don't know what I was on about with that shit about Cattle and Sheep and crap, but you know, probably some kind of Feminist-Commie-SJW anti-Meat bullshit. *If people weren't meant to eat meat than why does it taste good.*\n\nMan, I was super nitpicky and didn't understand the way the world worked at all back then. I bet I didn't get that communism doesn't work because of human nature as well. Because there is a universal human nature, like common sense, which isn't affected by culture or society at all.\n\nThere's no Semi-Random or Random distribution of animals because they all came from ~~Genosha~~ Atlantis, where the Aryan Genegineer created them to be useful. WAKE UP SHEEPLE! There is no agency, only the will of the divine. There is no God but Reason, and the Invisible Hand is its hand.\n\nOh look at Mr. Pretentious at a fancy school getting a *history* degree. Maybe if he was getting an actual *employable* degree, like literally any and all STEM fields, which are inherently superior, he'd be smart enough to talk about history. Ugh. Idiot. History is waiting for a single unified theory like Physics is, and when that day comes it will ~~cause the righteous to ascend into Heaven and bring about the End-Times as prophesied in Revelations~~ be great and stuff. This isn't Messianic at all.\n\nLook, friends, Marc Bloch was a Liberal French historian, clearly not to be trusted. Surrender monkey, ammirite. Also he was jewish. Presentism isn't a problem because people are the same, except people in the past were dumb, since we know better now. If they weren't dumb, why do I have a smartphone and infinite porn. Checkmate... uh... Dead people? Yeah, fuck dead people!\n\nMan, this jack-off is going on about details, like dude, why are you getting so into the small stuff. Give me a nice understandable not pedantic answer. All this commie SJW bullshit about 'details' and 'facts'. Give me an Ayn Rand book any day over this trash. Civilizations are the right people, the white people, bringing freedom and truth and liberty to the savages. Why can't this commie get that in his head.\n\nClearly the lack of alternate theorys to Diamond's masterwork is due to the fact it's right.^2\n\nso called \"heliocentrism\" the debate is still raging on that. Next he'll say evolution is a fact, or indisputable.\n\nAustralia's a white people country, idiot. like well maybe kinda tan, they got that whole sun-kissed beach-bum look down pat. Good looking people. Where was I? Oh yeah, no, I don't know what this SJW commie is on about with like non-white australians. It's just like, empty sand and kangaroos, and then the british showed up and started offloading convicts.\n\nlol this moron SJEW Liberal hack shill feminazi reverse-racist can't do CSS. Stupid humanities student. Then he spends like ages ranting degenerately at a fucking joke. It's a fucking joke, bro, cool off. Plus, it's not even like a right rant, it's all communist. Like, the holocaust has some pretty big discrepencies. Why was there a swimming pool at Auschwitz if it was a death camp? And like, how could you kill people with de-lousing agents. And how come there's never been *any* proof ever that hitler wanted to kill the jews. He had a dog, and loved his wife very much! And didn't smoke tobacco, though I bet he was cool with weed. Cuz he was a \"vegetarian\" y'know. Big into edibles. Next this commie'll be trying to tell us rational people that like, women have equal intellectual capacity to men, or that the Tiger I wasn't the best tank *in history*. It took 5 shermans to kill a tiger, and like 50 T-34s. Checkmate allied shill. Go back to your liberal-snowflake hugbox.\n\n***\n\n1. Marc Bloch, who was all right, even if he was kinda a pinko, and a Jew, and french, once wrote the word geography, so that means that the entire Annales School actually supports Diamond.\n\n2.

        "text": "Here at Badhistory, we love to bash a certain book. A book that thousands of little Americans read for AP world history. A book that has created not one, but three separate drama waves. A book that while raises some interesting points, is treated as the second coming by history enthusiasts everywhere. This book is none other than the critically acclaimed Guns, Germs, and Steel, by the Handsome [Jared](http://jewishcurrents.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/JaredDiamond.jpg) [Diam](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Jared_diamond.jpg)[ond](http://www.jareddiamond.org/Jared_Diamond/About_Me_files/shapeimage_1.png). \n\n[And while A thousand of angry annotations accredited to annoyed, asshole, anthropologists have written about Diamond's Work,](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/wiki/v2/ggsg) none have given him the fair shake that man deservers.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't agree with Jared Diamond, I think he missed the mark. You see, its not geography that lets some nations be powerful, but **[wig use](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/WilliamCushing.jpg/220px-WilliamCushing.jpg)**.\n\nDon't believe me? Read on.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWigs lead to a Powerful Empires. Here is some stunning evidence:\n\nDid you know the Egyptians used wigs? [Me neither](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wig#cite_note-Wallenfels_2000-1). The Egyptians harnessed the power of the Wig to build the pyramids and expand along the Nile. Clear evidence for [wig influence](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Egypte_louvre_286_couple.jpg/300px-Egypte_louvre_286_couple.jpg) as a pushing factor for large empires. \n\nNext, the Romans obviously used [wigs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Bust_Roman_woman_Glyptothek_Munich_333.jpg/276px-Bust_Roman_woman_Glyptothek_Munich_333.jpg) which led them to conquer much of Europe. In fact, according to a random line in wikipedia:\n\n&gt; After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the use of wigs fell into disuse in the West for a thousand years, [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wig#16th_and_17th_centuries)\n\nSo, the fall of wigs and the dark ages occurred at the same time. Staggering evidence. With Wigs There's Power.\n\nFast forward a bit, Napoleon attempts to conquer Europe, but he has one thing against him. [His lack of Wigs](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/05/20/18/pg-35-napoleon-1-dea-getty.jpg). France [had abandonded the wig](http://thehistoryofthehairsworld.com/hair_18th_century.html) and to a deadly result. Just think how much more prepared Napoleon's forces would be for General Winter if they had an extra layer above their head. \n\nIt goes without saying that during the 18th, 19th, and 20th Century British Empire became a [world wide power](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b543608ffae5acae68de44e7e2795f24-p). So it is no surprise that the British empire had wig-centric culture for the majority of these centuries, which created a great foundation for their success. However, as the presence of the British wig lessened in the early 1900s, other nations took notice. This lack of perceived Wig power led to WWWI in 1914, as other nations used this opportunity to spread their borders. \n\nAll the while, America became a growing world power. So it comes to no surprise that the United States had wigs. From George Washington's ['Totaly not a wig but comon, its the style of the time' near wig hair](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Gilbert_Stuart_Williamstown_Portrait_of_George_Washington.jpg/248px-Gilbert_Stuart_Williamstown_Portrait_of_George_Washington.jpg) to the [second](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Official_Presidential_portrait_of_John_Adams_%28by_John_Trumbull%2C_circa_1792%29.jpg/248px-Official_Presidential_portrait_of_John_Adams_%28by_John_Trumbull%2C_circa_1792%29.jpg), [third](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Thomas_Jefferson_by_Rembrandt_Peale%2C_1800.jpg/248px-Thomas_Jefferson_by_Rembrandt_Peale%2C_1800.jpg), [fourth](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/James_Madison.jpg/248px-James_Madison.jpg), and [fifth](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-C2DHv6sXTLI/TiA4nT1ONMI/AAAAAAAAA9Q/W98Qfvnksko/s512/james-monroe-hair.jpg) Presidents all wearing wigs. This appeared to be enough Wigs to propel the United States to the world stage for centuries. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSo there you have it. Where ever there is a powerful nation, there are more powerful wigs behind it. \n\nNow, why would wigs cause an empire's success? Further study is required. In the mean time, want to pass a test? Get the Girl/Guy? Get that promotion? Maybe take a cue from our ancestors and put on a white, powdery, puffy, wig. \n\n",

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! Whilst I am working on the new skill system for my RPG, I felt like it was time to finish my review of Deadliest Warrior, Season 2, Episode 6: Roman Centurion Versus Rajput: \n\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x517l13 \n\n19.06: The narrator mentions they are testing the slicing power of a sword designed for thrusting. DRINK!\n\n19.28: That shield is held in such an incorrect fashion that the protective advantage gained from covering one's body is lost. The shield is strapped to the man's arm like an aspis, whilst a Roman would have held theirs in a fist grip. DRINK!\n\n19.40: The gel dummy's liver has been destroyed. I know his pain.\n\n20.01: \"This weapon seems like it is doing some damage\". Said the Rajput expert about a dismembered corpse.\n\n20.13. The Rajput experts are stating how the Khanda is a good counter to the Scutum and Gladius combo because it is longer and designed for slashing. Meanwhile, a Celtic warrior is most likely standing off to the side and smirking.\n\n20.23: Whilst most sources I enounter state that varieties of the Khanda appear from the 9th century AD onwards, the show seems to been using the image of a Rajput warrior from the 1500s. DRINK!\n\n20.49: I want to criticize the show for engaging in Hollywood weapon twirling, but it looks so cool I shall let it slide.\n\n21.17: This is less \"sword fighting\" and more \"grunting whilst trying to move furniture.\". The attacks are also very slow, and the guy would have been stabbed multiple times by a Roman already. DRINK!\n\n21.42: If the Romans employ stationary, unarmoured cows as front-line infantry, they are in big trouble.\n\n24.13: It seems I have accidentally changed the channel to an episode of Xena: Warrior Princess. \n\n24.19: Tod makes no mention of the Chakram being a traditional weapon of the Rajputs, nor does he mention it when outlining their history (God Bless digital texts and the search function). Whilst this blog post:\n\nhttp://www.rom.on.ca/en/blog/weapon-wednesday-chakram-from-india\n\nStates that the Chakram was indeed a historical weapon, and would have been used by the Kshatriya caste, it seems only to have come into the popular consciousness through the Sikhs, so I am counting its association with the Rajputs here as an inaccuracy, especially since Tod makes frequent references to archery. DRINK!\n\n25.53:  Aaaaaaaand the ranged weapon of the Romans is the Scorpion ballista. Let me repeat this; they are taking a weapon that *had to be assembled first, and was only useful in sieges or pitched battle, and using it in a duel*. DRIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNKKKKKKKKK!\n\n26.02: Roman Centurion to Rajput: \"Dude, could you wait for an hour or two while I set this up?\"\n\n26.33: \"The Scorpion was the machine gun of the ancient world\". Minus the accuracy, rate of fire, ease of use, durability, flexibility, and technical complexity.\n\n28.14: \"It's a solid 14 inches of penetration\". Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n29.23: So a weapon that can be quickly thrown by hand as the edge over one that requires almost a minute to reload? Whodathunk!\n\n30.54: The last Rajput weapon is the Aara whip-sword, which is also knowns as the Urumi. This is a really hard weapon to find proper sources for, so I will hold a drink in reserve until someone more knowledgeable than me can provide more information.\n\n31.51: There is something disconcerting about a Sikh wearing traditional clothing with Nike-brand shoes.\n\n31.57: One of the hosts state the mannequins are equipped with real Roman shields. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! DRINK!\n\n33.05: Now they are comparing the Pilum to a hand-to-hand weapon, when it was a better counterpart to the Chakram. DRINK!\n\n33.18: \"This is the Pilum. It was the Roman's flying missile of death\". As opposed to the walking missile of life.\n\n38.41: Now it is time for the epic conflict between these two foes. FIGHT!\n\n38.48: So the lone Roman centurion spent all this time putting together his Scorpion and just hoped someone would wander by so he could shoot at them?\n\n39.18: The Rajput had plenty of time to dodge that Pilum. Cutting it in two was just showing off.\n\n29.24: And now we have the Roman deciding it is the perfect time to use his Dolobra as a weapon. Whilst still holding a shield. DRINK!\n\n39.42: \"YOU AVOIDED MY HILARIOUSLY SLOW ATTACK! CURSE YOU!\"\n\n39.45: So the Rajput had a choice of either severing the shaft of the Dolobra or cutting off the Roman's arms. Guess which he chose?\n\nAnd that is the end of that. Thank God. \n\nEdit: Don't forget to read and upvote the reviews of u/gaiusmariusj!

        "author": "WearyTunes",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/622kfs/review_of_historys_challenge_a_cpusa_documentary/",
        "text": "Link to part [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRmJKODw2uA) \n\nFor this, i'm going to skip over statements they aren't making about their own history, as a lot of the documentary is clips of people making political statements. \n\nSo lets get to it\n\n--\n\n\n00:44 - \"It is this class struggle between oppressor and oppressed that gave rise to the Communist Party.\"\n\n05:38 - \"In 1919, with the industrial revolution still expanding, The Communist Party was founded.\"\n\n06:08 - \"The Party grew out of the struggle to organize the steel workers.\"\n\n\nRight out of the gate, there's a problem with that characterization. \n\nThe historiography of american communism is contentious, but there's pretty broad agreement that the basic facts laid out by Draper in \"Roots of American Communism\" are accurate. The first Communists didn't appear out of thin air, they were largely members of the Socialist Party's Left-Wing. Though i think Draper emphasizes the importance of Syndicalism to paint Foster's reversal on his trade union beliefs as an analogy for Communism's destruction of a once-genuine american radicalism, the party indisputably had it's origins in the Bolshevik Revolution. Believing that the success of the bolsheviks was indicative of the inevitable historical progression towards communism, the excitement was enough to forge a coalition around a Left-Wing that had long sought to integrate direct action into marxist thought.\n\nThe last of the three statements is fishy as well. The Left-Wing actually held it's own conference in New York a few months before the Chicago Conference of 1919 as response to the Socialist Party's expulsion of the Language Federations. The Federations would then used that good will to force a farther-left line at the New York convention, and would then walk out on the convention when the procedure was voted down. This difference was then overshadowed by the issue of how to take over the Socialist Party.\n\nWhen the attempt to commandeer the Socialist Party's Chicago convention failed, the Communists actually formed two parties: The Communist Labour Party which consisted of the left-wing's majority (mostly american radicals associated with syndicalism), and the Communist Party of America which was largely controlled my the Language Federations and more Orthodox.\n\nTheir insistence that this was somehow connected to the steel strikes at the time is honestly just bizarre. Both parties were driven underground soon after forming. Ruthenburg himself said \"it would have been difficult to gather together half a dozen who knew anything about the trade union movement.\"  Their invocation of Foster only makes it seem weirder. Firstly, Foster did not interact with the Communist movement until after the strikes; he worked in secret alongside them in the early 1920s using Browder as a go-between. Secondly, the parties strongly criticized Foster's steel strike while it was happening, lauding him with names like \"E. Z. Foster,\" and advocated its members work against it as the only true goal was a general strike that would bring down capitalism. \n\n--\n\n07:39 - \"It was the communist party that helped draft the bills for unemployment insurance.\"\n\nThis is more plausible than it sounds, but i can't find any evidence for it. The Social Security Act was passed in 35, right as the CPUSA party-line changed from the Second Period to Popular Frontism. That being said, Browder was slow to warm up to the New Deal, and didn't advocate for formally lobbying the goverment until much later.\n\n\n--\n\nUnion Half of the rest of the video is hyperbolic, but nothing bad enough to focus on specifically. It's true that the CPUSA had enormous amounts of power in the CIO. So much that at some points, they had to prevent their own members from getting too communisty with it.\n\n\n--\n\n\nAs for the bit about the Communists advocating for the violent overthrow of the goverment, it's kinda complicated. The original Socialist moderate and right factions (those apposed to direct action) took a stance similar to Kautsky. Their conception of revolution was political, not military; it would also happen when the proletarians had developed a class identity and voted the Socialists into power. Lenin was a departure from this. One of the reasons he appealed so much to syndicalists and anarchists was that he used Marxism to justify an immediate revolution. \n\nBy the end of WW2, the CPUSA was dominated by Browderism (he had actually disbanded the CPUSA and replaced it with the Communist Political Association, which was intended to act as an interest group), which was non-revolutionary. Today, Communists would consider it revisionary. However, due to internal and external (read Soviet) pressure, Browder was removed from the party and his revision stamped out. The New line after his disposal was farther left, but Browder's Flip-flop during the Nazi Soviet pact, repression from the US at the start of the cold war, and Kruschev's exposure of Stalin's crimes quickly decimated any popularity the party had and drove it into obscurity. \n\n[Browder would live until the early 70s;](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/earl-browder-entering-federal-courthouse-with-fbi-agents-after-arrest-picture-id540671400?s=612x612) by accident of geography he was forced to watch his life's work, ideology, and place in history dismantled one by one.

Hell, Scipio's army probably has more flexibility than whatever they had in the 1st century AD. Hell, Odenthaus's army in the 3rd century probably has more flexibility than whatever they had in the 1st century AD. To call it the greatest weapon of the greatest army the world has yet seen probably is just a trick on my ears. \n\n\n&gt;1.22, the soldiers are marching with their various ornaments that seem to cover their upper body.\n\nIn the first century AD, they wore leather jacket with leather shoulder-pieces, \nEventually, in the time of Trajan, we will see more elaborate ornaments around the belt and fancy buckles, and corselet with iron hoops and leather cords allow for better protection and better movements. They will also wear straps of metal strips serve as shoulder-pieces, and they would often wear some type of mail armor with interlocking rings or metal scales sewn in overlapping rows on a leather coat. \n\n&gt;2.00 narrator, Rome the greatest nation in the world was paying tribute to barbarians. \n\nUnder the patronage system, those in power provide for their clients. Dacia was entered as a Roman client kingdom. Client kings stayed client kings because they are paid as client kings.\n\n&gt;2.45, narrator, Rome tried to buy peace, but the Dacian broke the bargain. \n\nThis is relative. Is it cheaper to wage a war, or is it cheaper to pay a client king to stay client king? \n\nIn either case, Domitian probably has no real intention to honor this agreement, as he kept building forces in Upper Moesia. A tradition continued by Trajan. \n\nAnd really, the Dacian broke the bargain? \n\n&gt;6.55 narrator, he spent 6-month drilling twice a day, mock battle with wicker shield and wooden sword, twice as heavy as the real weapon, and wielded just as harshly.\n\n I can't really tell if these shields are round, but according to Vegetius wrote that they fought in round wickerwork shields and wooden staves. They were made to practice at the stakes - the stakes were planted in the ground by each recruit and are often 6ft in height. Recruits were to fight it as if it were the real enemy. \n\n&gt;8.11 Directed by their engineers and architect, the legionary began the war against Dacian by building. Taking up the tools of stone mason and carpenter, they erected a line of forts to guard their supplies against Dacian raids. Behind these walls, a man like Tiberius, city-bred, immerse themselves in the comfort of Rome. /the camera showed camps on flat ground, on wood.\n\n\nThe strategic camps and not forward camps have many different buildings. The standard legionary camps sit at strategic locations covering 50-60 acres. The most significant building is the headquarter. Then there are offices, storerooms, halls, and shrines Then the commander’s house, with military tribunes. Then the barrack blocks consist housing for 8 men, and then the centurion's quarters. There are also granaries, baths, stables, lavatories, workshops, and hospital. \nThe forward camp is another story. Vegetius described 3 kinds of camps.\n\n\n**If danger is not immediate, the legionary will dig the earth and build a 3 ft high wall, so there will be a ditch already there. Then they dig another emergency ditch, 9ft wide and 7ft deep.**\n\n\n**If the danger is around, but not fighting yet, a fully fortified camp will be constructed. 12ft wide and 9ft deep for the ditch, a 4ft high mound, so the defense is essentially 13ft at this point. Then on top of the mound, they place stout woods that they carry with them. **\n\n\n**If the fight is immediate, then the whole cavalry unit and half of the infantry are pushed forward to repel any attacks, while the remainder of the man fortifies the camp by digging ditches. **\n\n\nSince this was talking about ‘fighting Dacian raids’ I am guessing these are actual forward camps. And no ditches anywhere to be seen. \n\n&gt;12.09 \tAs the Dacian spy watched, the legionary fortified the ground they would sleep on. *Whenever they invade hostile territory the legionary refuse to do battle until they fortified their camp. … If the ground is uneven, it is thoroughly leveled….  \n\nAgain, where are my ditch? The Romans didn’t raise wooden wall 10 ft high, which was what the camera was suggesting. It was 13 ft because they dig a giant trench. And it isn’t a camp made of wood, it is a camp made from earth they dug up, complimented with wood. \n\n14.24 Trajan send his cavalry ahead, to find the enemy and flush out ambushes. This horseman, like the other auxiliary, like archers and slingers, are recruited from conquered tribes. \n\nEmperors have been using both a German bodyguard and also praetorian speculators. But Trajan also probably formed the equites singulares, it was 500 – 1000 man strong. These men guarded Trajan with their lives, and Trajan trusted them with his safety. These men, while were from conquered tribes in history, have already served in the auxiliary, and were handpicked, and commanded by the praetorian prefect. \n\n&gt;17.55, showed pilum and how it buckles. \n\nAlso, a shield struck by a pilum was rendered useless. So you can’t throw it back, and you also lose a shield. \n-------------------------------------------------------\nI am kind of OK with this. Except for the ditch bits.\n\nThe Army of the Caesars, Michael Grant.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/60krvt/shakespeare_didnt_write_shakespeare_but_literally/",
        "text": "So the idea that Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare has become a bit of a historical conspiracy theory that's so juicy they even made a movie about it, *Anonymous*, which sits at a solid 46% on Rotten Tomatoes, likely because the literature-Illuminati seem hell bent on pushing the narrative.  [Here's Keir Cutler PhD \"debunking\" the Shakespeare myth.](https://youtu.be/cJ72Ew1ujlk?t=17s)  Surprisingly he did this through a one man show instead of in any sort of peer reviewed journal given the enormity of his claim. So did Shakespeare write Shakespeare? Is Keir Cutler just an idiot who has no idea what he's talking about?  And perhaps most importantly [did he write is own IMDb bio, or does he have one very dedicated fan that fondly remembers the day he scored 3 touchdowns in a single game for McGill University?](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193933/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm)\n\n0:17-4:28: Skipping an opening non-sequitur I'll get to and passing through a brief introduction which likely took literal minutes in Adobe Premiere we are greeted by the sight of Dr. Cutler in judge's robes holding a bust of the beloved bard.  The visual metaphor complete, he questions the audience on the statue, his excitement is palpable as he nears the clincher, Shakespeare didn't write anything!  Ha!  You fools!  You worship this man as a god, and yet he is but a sham!  \n\nThen he posits a whole load of things he believes Shakespeare scholars believe about Shakespeare, the majority of which is bunk. Let's examine one such claim: \"There's no record of him even going to elementary school,\" Cutler shouts, which is technically true.  In fact there is no record of anyone going to Stratford-upon-Avon's grammer school during that time, as the records of that period burned up in a fire.  However, it is here that we reach the central kernel of his argument, and in fact most Anti-Stratfordian, bullshit: \n\nShakespeare couldn't possibly write the great works of English literature because he was born a poor nobody and only rich classy people can attain such knowledge.  Honestly how poor people can even walk and breathe at the same time represents a triumph of the human spirit.\n\n\n4:49-7:06: Cutler talks about how Shakespeare scholars assume that Shakespeare traveled all over the world, including to Constantinople, which was conquered by the Turks a little over 100 years before his birth, but who's counting.  Of course Shakespeare scholars don't think this because Shakespeare's works show a complete lack of knowledge about the world outside of England.  The Two Gentleman of Verona mentions people sailing from [Milan] (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Milan,+Italy/@45.4429615,4.2189871,5.91z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4786c1493f1275e7:0x3cffcd13c6740e8d!8m2!3d45.4654219!4d9.1859243) to [Verona](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Verona,+Province+of+Verona,+Italy/@45.4262289,10.9224915,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x477f5f68699be0e3:0x53f85a636882595b!8m2!3d45.4383842!4d10.9916215).  In a Winter's Tale he gives Bohemia a coast line.  Merchant of Venice has no mention of canals. The people of Vienna in Measure for Measure have Italian names.  And Delphi is apparently an island in Corliolanus.  Seriously, Shakespeare's plays are a whole bunch of r/badgeography posts just waiting to happen.\n\nThen he goes on the long list of other skills he mastered, including his classical education he must have had to write this bit of Hector's dialogue from Troiles and Cressida, a play set in the Trojan war \"Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought / Unfit to hear moral philosophy.\"  which is only one of the mistakes of classical history Shakespeare makes in his plays many of which are also listed in *Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae*  which just so happened to have been gifted to the Stratford-upon-Avon's grammar school.\n\n\n7:07-7:48: Seven minutes in and finally we get a thesis statement: \"The man who wrote Shakespeare's works could not have been William Shakespeare, and wasn't.\"\n\nHonestly, not convinced considering a lot of the mistakes Shakespeare makes seem perfectly possible for an under-educated man working with a grammar school book which seems to cross reference his mistakes, but not for let's say the educated Earl of Oxford who traveled throughout Italy, and likely knew you can't sail from Milan to Verona.\n\n7:49-9:31 In so many words he calls Shakespeare a shmuck, bringing up how there are no original scripts of his, although we have no original works of Christopher Marlowe or Ben Johnson either, because Theater is primarily a visual and not written medium.  Not only that, but also theater was seen as low-brow entertainment, unlike poetry. Finally how Voltaire, the son of minor nobility, living a hundred years after Shakespeare, has had 21,000 of his letters survive, but none of Shakespeare's?!  Or Marlowe's?!  And only two state copies of Kyd's after he was tortured?! Seriously, just because these pieces of evidence are lacking doesn't mean Shakespeare was illiterate.  Original scripts weren't valued as much in his time as they are for us now.  I doubt that we have any originals of any Elizabethan Theater, but I could be wrong.\n\n9:32-12:00: Oddly confrontational anti-Stratfordian posturing.\n\n12:01- 12:20: He claims that Shakespeare has no history to record, however here is some recorded history of Shakespeare from his lifetime and by contemporaries after his death. In 1596 Shakespeare's father was granted the title of \"gentleman\" because of the success of his son. Ben Jonson, a fellow playwright, wrote in Timber or Discoveries \"I loved the man, and do honour his memory (on this side Idolatry) as much as any.\" Another playwright John Webster wrote in the preface to one book of his plays (in 1612 while Shakespeare was still alive) \"And lastly (without wrong last to be named), the right happy and copious industry of M. Shake-Speare, M. Decker, &amp; M. Heywood, wishing what I write might be read in their light.\"\n\n12:21-14:26 :So I waited with baited breathe to see who the hell this guy picked as his candidate for the real Shakespeare.  Is he an Oxfordian?  Or one of the dingbats that believes that Marlowe faked his own death, and then continued to write plays in England? No, of course not he thinks Shakespeares works must have been written by any number of authors.  Shakespeare was the Alan Smithee of his time, but instead of something awful, it was connected to some of the greatest works of English literature.  Why?Because theater was low-brow entertainment not fitting for a man of high standing.  Wait didn't I just argue this is why none of his scripts survived?  \n\nNot just that though!  People may want to stay anonymous because of politics!  And torture!  And to prove his point, Cutler lists a ton of possible Shakespeare candidates, some of whom were imprisoned for writing plays, which begs the question why they didn't just attribute these plays to Shakespeare.  I could also go into all the pro-state posturing Shakespeare has in MacBeth and Richard III, but that's a different story \n\n14:27-23:25 :More confidential Anti-Stratfordian posturing. Including a strange Stratford-upon-Avon tourism conspiracy theory about all that Shakespeare money they get.  Also he believes that Shakespeare scholars say the bard practiced law, something I had never heard before, and the only found in sources attributing Shakespeare's works to others.\n\n23:26- End :Here is where he goes in the countless possible people that could have been Shakespeare.  Explaining the intricacies of the theories on the Earl of Oxford and Christopher Marlowe, focusing oddly on their lives in Italy (or conspiratorially on Marlowe's life on the run in Italy after faking his death and sending plays back to England to be preformed) despite Shakespeare's obvious lack of knowledge on that area.  Arguing that it has to be Francis Bacon because he lived in St. Albins, which is mentioned 15 times in the canon, while Stratford-upon-Avon is mentioned zero times.  \"When has a writer never mentioned his home town?\" decries Cutler. I await the Quentin Tarantino movie set in Knoxville, Tennessee with baited breath.\n\nAnyways here's the last nail in the Anti-Stratfordian argument. [There's a study](http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/welliott/UTConference/Oxford_by_Numbers.pdf) which set to prove that the 29 plays attributed solely to Shakespeare were written, in fact, by the Earl of Oxford, Edward De Vere, and found that they were dead wrong.  Analyzing the subtler points of writing (use of compound words, feminine endings in meter, etc) and found that indeed one individual wrote these 29 plays, and against some 20 possible candidates for Shakespeare, none of them matched said profile.  Quite frankly, either Shakespeare wrote his works, or some unknown person wrote the canon under the assumed name William Shakespeare.\n\nThanks for reading, this turned out to be a lot longer than it should have been, but God dammit all, I'm tired of people arguing this.  It's roots lie in classism, the idea that a son of an illiterate glover couldn't make anything of note, and that only those who are rich or well educated can possibly make works worthy of being preserved through the ages.  And fuck people that believe that shit.",

        "text": "The authors claims that she had learned, during school,  that the ancients *\"over thousands of years, had great engineering and scientific advances as well as passable medical advances and that all this was lost during the Medieval Period in Europe – aptly called the Dark Ages because European civilization lost most ancient advances with the collapse of the ancient cultures that birthed them. The work of the Ancients was picked up after the Dark Ages, during The Enlightenment, when Europeans invented the scientific method and saw reason as the best way to run a society\"*\n\nThe claim is that while some authors have challenged this view, the view that there indeed was a dark age, and that it took until the Enlightenment to bring back Greco-Roman values/thinking is the scholarly view (she does not say that per se, but she implies it in saying that she was not duped in learning that history).\n\nShe goes on to write that medieval Christian theology was 'the enemy of science and medicine as well'.\n\n----\n\nThe idea that the Greeks and Romans were on the 'verge of a scientific revolution' is questionable.The author of the article seems to strongly suggest that they had amazing things, which were all lost during the 'Dark Ages'. The historian of science James Hannam notes that the Greeks were not trying to develop science. Their goal was to develop an understanding of the natural world as it related to their ethical theories (and not simply and objectively trying to understand the universe simply for the sake of doing so).\n\nSecondly, the claim that 'all this was lost during the Medieval Period In Europe' is challenged by the fact that the church played a pivotal role in preserving literacy and knowledge of the Greek philosophers (classics) during the early middle ages ^[1](http://www.equip.org/article/christianity-led-rise-modern-science/). \n\nFurthermore, as Dr. James Hannam  [argues] (http://www.equip.org/article/christianity-led-rise-modern-science/) Christians in this era used science as a way to understand the natural world. He  explains that the biblical doctrine of creation (interrupted as ex nihilo by the famous theologian St.Augustine) lead to the understanding amongst Christian theologians that nature was separate from God and \"followed the laws He had ordained it\". This meant, in contrast to the Greek Philosophers who accepted the rationality of the laws of nature, the majority (not all, though) of Christian thinkers believed that nature's laws were God's laws instead of the laws of logic. He concludes by stating:*\"The principle of God’s freedom and absolute power was the subject of a decree by the bishop of Paris in 1277. He stated that because God could do as He pleased, He could do things that philosophers said were impossible, like creating a vacuum or more than one universe.22 This opened up a world of possibility that Christian natural philosophers were quick to exploit.*\"^[2](http://www.equip.org/article/christianity-led-rise-modern-science/)\n\nOf course, Christians then were not trying to make progress to science as we know it today. For them, it was a tool that allowed them to become better theologians and philosophers. Hannam notes, *\"it was just that the metaphysical background to Christianity turned out to be uniquely conducive to successfully understanding the working of nature.\"*^[3](http://www.equip.org/article/christianity-led-rise-modern-science/) This disproves the author's points that Christian theology was the \"enemy of science\".\n\nIn my opinion, the notion that Christian theology was the enemy of science seems to be another variant of the 'conflict thesis'. And this is, to my understanding, rejected by the vast majority of historians specializing in that era. \n\n[For the article](http://canadianatheist.com/2014/02/the-christian-re-write-of-mediaeval-history/)\n\n",

        "text": "There's a movie that my friends have been trying to talk me into seeing with them. It apparently contains a live action version of [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afzmwAKUppU), which, they argue, I'd love because it's basically dishes singing about food, which is more or less what I think about all the time. \"You'll love it,\" they keep telling me. \"Be Our Guest is a great song.\"\n\nThe problem though, dear readers, is that I can't enjoy \"Be Our Guest,\" no matter how much singing food and French accents there are. You see, \"Be Our Guest\" has a historical inaccuracy. You'll see it at the 58 second mark in the video I linked as food happily marches by. It's not the souffle, not the hors d'ouevres. No, it's the flambe. I'm sorry to have to tell you that flambe being in the musical number with dancing food and singing dishes is not historically accurate. \n\nBut let me back up a moment. \"Quouar,\" you might say, \"This is a Disney movie, and Disney movies exist in a weird alternate, timeless reality.\" And I agree that there is some truth to that. With Beauty and the Beast, though, there are some helpful clues that help us determine roughly what time period \"Beauty and the Beast\" takes place in. \n\nThe first clue comes from [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuJTqmpBnI0), in which we see Gaston boasting about his shooting prowess and general manliness. What's important here, though, is the type of gun he's boasting about. You can see it both in his portrait, and in the song itself when he starts shooting innocent barrels. The gun has a flared muzzle, which makes it a [blunderbuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunderbuss). Blunderbusses had their heyday in the 17th and 18th centuries, and while some were still owned by private citizens in the 19th century, they were considered obsolete by the mid-19th century. Given how proud Gaston is of his hunting prowess, it seems unlikely that he would have been out hunting with an obsolete weapen, so based on the gun alone, we know the film likely takes place before the 19th century. \n\nAnother major clue comes from [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAzxnHP4erQ). First, it establishes pretty definitively that we're in France, which means that when analysing what the presence of a bookstore in a rural French town means in terms of the time period of this film, we can look at [French literacy statistics](https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/). It's important to note that the definition of \"literacy\" has shifted since the Enlightenment, so while it currently means \"able to read and write,\" early statistics would have included anyone who could write their name. Taking into account the shifting definition, it's not until the 1750s to 1800s that we start seeing more widespread general literacy. That literacy was lower for women, but I think it's reasonable to say that Belle, being the daughter of an inventor, would have been educated to the best of the inventor's ability, and so would likely have been able to read. However, the fact that a bookstore is able to survive as a store at all, though, means there needed to be some degree of widespread literacy, which means the film must take place no earlier than roughly 1750. Interestingly, Belle's particular town is also likely in the northeast of France, since [that was the area with the highest literacy and most able to support a dedicated bookstore in the late 18th century](http://www.localpopulationstudies.org.uk/pdf/lps42/lps42_1989_32-42.pdf). Just as an aside.\n\nThe most important clue in determining time period, however, comes from the Beast. The Beast is a noble with a title and a castle and all that jazz, and there's an event in French history that had a tendency to strip nobles of those sorts of things. In 1790, the French Revolution made being a prince a rather unpopular occupation, and while the privileges of the nobility wouldn't be totally and finally stripped until the end of the July Monarchy in 1848, a castle like that would likely have made the Beast a target of some sort. We know that the film must take place before 1848, or else it would be totally inaccurate to call the Beast a \"prince.\" We also know that as a prince, the Beast would have likely been fairly unpopular from 1790 onwards. Because of this, it seems reasonable to me to say that the film takes place somewhere between 1750 and 1790 in northeast France.\n\nWhich brings me back to the flambe. The earliest reference I could find to something being flambed comes from \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens in 1843 in which he describes a pudding surrounded by flaming brandy (pretty much the definition of flambe). While it's likely that tasty desserts were being set on fire before 1843, it's telling to me that he doesn't call it \"flambe,\" but rather \"thing in alcohol that we set on fire.\" It's not until 1847 that we start seeing the term in French cookbooks, implying that for Lumiere to state that the dessert is flambed, he would have to be using the term in the mid-19th century. \n\nWell, you see the problem. All indicators are that this film takes place in the late 18th century. There's no way for Lumiere, the magical talking candlestick, to be able to use the term \"flambed\" to describe his cooking technique for the flaming dessert. It's a historical inaccuracy. \"Flambe,\" while it is a French word, as a technique was likely not widespread until at least the mid-19th century.\n\nBasically, then, films with dancing food and singing cutlery are not good sources for learning about 18th century French cuisine.\n\nSources!\n\n[A French cookbook from 1847 which contains a flambeed dessert](https://archive.org/details/gastronomicrege00soyegoog)\n\n[Literacy charts from 1600 onwards in Europe!](https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/)\n\n[A paper about literacy and social mobility in 19th century France](http://www.localpopulationstudies.org.uk/pdf/lps42/lps42_1989_32-42.pdf)\n\n[A brief bit from this man about 18th century rural French literacy](http://www.nobility.org/2011/08/22/astonishing-adult-literacy-rates/)\n\n[A recipe for crepes suzette because yum.](http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/crepes-suzette)\n\nEDIT: Also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeN8saLI1IE) which has now been in my head all day.",

        "text": "Yet another online article from a seemingly promising source, this time [something as simple as brief biography of Augustus](http://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/augustus.html). Not much that can go amiss, right? Well I am going to nitpick anyway.\n\nFirst of all it says\n&gt;In 46 BC, Caesar won the civil war and was named dictator of Rome. To secure his position, he needed an heir. With no son of his own, he adopted Augustus.\n\n&gt;This was a fantastic opportunity for a young man from nowhere. Almost at once, however, Caesar was dead - murdered by his own advisors. \n\nGiven that the office of dictator and consul were not inheritable I have no idea why he would have needed a son to hold onto them. Also no one knew that Octavian would be Caesar's heir in 46 BC because the will (which was not read until *after* his death) was not even drawn up until 45 making Octavian a posthumous adoption.\n\n&gt;The killing over, the empire was theirs and they divided the spoils. Augustus kept Rome, while Antony took Egypt. There he fell under the spell of Cleopatra, Egypt's beautiful queen.\n\nYes, of course, Augustus and Marc Antony defeated the conspirators and then went \"Dude, lets go halvsies\" \"Nah bro, Rome ain't big enough for two. You can go take Egypt though the other half of Rome's dominions\" \"Aw thanks fam, I hear Egypt's lit af\". \n\nBut Egypt was not even a province, and Antony was given the Eastern provinces, which had many territories in it but Egypt is conspicuously missing. While Lepidus did get Africa this province also did not include Egypt for obvious reasons. And the reason Marc Antony is never referred to as the king or governor of Egypt by ancient sources and Cleopatra is depicted as ruling with her Caesarion as co-regent in name is because Antony was given control of *Roman* territories and the Second ~~Triumvirate~~ Duo did not forcibly annex Egypt after vanquishing Cassius. \n\nI will even cede the point of whether Antony was truly \"under the spell\" of Cleopatra or just acting in his own interests but that line is still way off the mark. You see, in 41 BC Antony and Cleopatra met in *Tarsus* not Egypt and this is the time that they first began having and affair *and* when she began supporting his Parthian campaigns. You may think this is just being pedantic but first of all, if he was ruling Egypt that would have been unnecessary and secondly the next time they saw each other was in Antioch in 37 BC and he did not meet with her in Alexandria until 34 BC which is like 7 years later. On the bright side, we finally have vindication for the [Lepidus truthers](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/55z4ug/wondering_wednesday_05_october_2016_conspiracy/?st=j0efv2tn&amp;sh=a8d61bab) because he was clearly not a part of their initial alliance or first division of territory. \n\n&gt;Romans feared that Cleopatra wanted the throne for herself and his relationship with her made Mark Antony a hated man in Rome. His alliance with Augustus disintegrated but, before Antony and Cleopatra could strike Rome, Augustus attacked.\n\nRomans feared Cleopatra wanted the throne...the throne of Egypt? A bit late for that, she had been ruling for like 18 years already. Maybe they meant the throne of Rome, but I was not even aware Rome had a throne or that Cleopatra could ever have hoped to attain it by manipulation. Also I do not think Antony was really disliked by the majority back in Rome, at least not until after the Donations of Alexandria and the reading of a pretty scandalous will. I kind of have the feeling that the author just watched HBO's *Rome* and decided their research was done. \n\nAll in all, this was somewhat short badhistory but I felt like sharing.",

        "text": "[5 Mysterious Writings, Glyphs &amp; Historical Artifacts That Are Still Unsolved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN3Y16YLqYE) is all you can expect from Internet clickbait:\nIt start with vague and somewhat carefully worded premise, that is hard to argue: yes, kids, there is many artefact's that are mysterious and we don't know what exactly they meant to people who made them (even more so if you are post-processualist).\n\nAs per tradition, this vaguely reasonable premise is undermined immediately, as voice is paired with pictures of well-known, long-debunked fakes.\n\n&gt;Get comfy, because this is going to be a very in depth and thought-provoking video.\n\nNo, no it's not.\n\nAnd so the very first Mysterious Historical Artifacts That Is Still Unsolved is... **Piri Reis map**.\nAhmed Piri was famous Ottoman admiral (reis) of 16th century. While his military career was fine, even if of little note, admiral is remembered for his cartographical work *Book of the Sea*.The map in question (original work of Piri himself) was found in 1929, among the old papers in Ottoman imperial palace. Discovery become sensation immediately, because Piri Reis used now-lost Christopher Columbus maps as a source. Maps become a sensation among bad historians only after WWII, thanks to Arlington Humphrey Mallery engineer of US Navy Hydrographic Office, who proposed that southern parts of the map, in fact, depicted Queen Maud Land. Theory (using the word loosely) reached wider audiences thanks to Charles Hapgood's *Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings* (1966) and  Erich von Däniken's *Chariots of the Gods* (1968). Bout of them equally unqualified on the subject and bout worked hard to outdo each other misinterpreting it. \nCutting long story short: no, Piri Reis map is not *\" absolutely accurate*\" as Däniken claimed (Virgin Islands are doubled, Cuba is part of continent, there is some huge islands east of the Guianas etc.) and [no, it does not depict Antarctica.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Piri_Reis_map_interpretation.jpg)\n\nBonus: the video implies, that Alexander of Macedonia himself was a cartographer (at 1:49) (it's misreading and misunderstanding of Piri's note, that he used *\"maps drawn in the time of Alexander the Great\"*, albeit it's most likely that his source was Ptolemy's *Geographia*)\n\nBut wait, there's more! Video also drags in Orontius Finaeus map, not surprisingly, because this map was also \"discovered\" by Hapgood. What is surprising is that maker of the video in question (I don't know his name, but as he is from GB, I refer unto him as \"daft pillock\" further on) does not know the name of Finaeus (3:07-3:23). It's just some \"other cartographer\". No one important, really. \nAs for map of Terra Australis itself, it kinda look like vaguely Antarctic-uesque, unless you [look at the whole map](http://www.diegocuoghi.com/Piri_Reis/Finaeus.jpg) rather that a piece. In his original (can't deny that part) work, for Terra Australis to fit with the outline of Antarctica, Hapgood had not only to resize it, but also rotate it a bit, move South Pole about 1000 km., and push around portions of coastline. It all was explained along the lines of: *\"Ol' Finaeus made some mistakes. Here, let my fix them for you. See, NOW it's Antarctica.\"*\n\nAnd the second Mysterious Historical Artifacts is... surprisingly something that could and should be placed on such list. **Rohonc Codex** is a manuscript of religious nature that surfaced in early 19th century. And that is pretty much all what we know about it. Putting aside all bogus theories about Sumerian and Dravidian connections, there is a number of theories that can explain the mystery:\n\n* It's some shorthand or cipher, unreadable because it is exactly what intention was: alchemists (and astrologers) were especially notorious for use of heavy symbolism and codes and also had a healthy paranoia about what we would call economic espionage. \n\n* Heavy religious nature of the book might indicate that it might be legacy of some religious sect. While Hungary and Eastern Europe in general, as general rule, was much more lenient towards religious minorities than f.e. Tudors England, but most dissidents would find sense in penning his filthy heresies in some shorthand understandable only to his cult. \n\n* Or- as it is most widely accepted among Hungarian academia- it is work of [Sámuel Literáti Nemes](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/b9789004276819_008), a high-profile forger who was active around the time codex surfaced.\n\nSimply said, no one knows what this manuscript is. To the daft pillock the only reasonable conclusion to take from this fact is that it holds ancient knowledge of mankind forgotten past.\n\nAnd then we informed that **Codex Gigas** is also Mysterious Historical Artifact too. I genuinely was unaware of that. Because there is nothing mysterious about it. It is, actually- except for the size of it- rather typical medieval monastery work: it contains *Biblia Vulgata*, *Chronica Boemorum*, works of Flavius Josephus, Isidore of Seville, Hippocrates etc. and- as there was still empty pages- information important to the monastery: list of monks, calendar and such. In medieval times few could afford to make a separate book  for every, well... book, so usual practice was to make one big codex and stuff it full.\nCodex Gigas most notorious for huge- taking all page- picture of the Devil, that is painted in contrast to the Kingdom of Heaven, depicted in previous page. Symbolism and ideas are quite clear and it's far from craziest sh*it Medieval monks ever painted.\nWhat secrets surrounds it and what is so mysterious about the codex is still beyond me and daft pillock gives no insights on that.\n\nNumber 4 on our list is... **Ica Stones of Peru**.  You know, whose *totally real, you guys* artifacts, who were sold to the local doctor by the Ican farmers, one of whom (Basilio Uschuya) not only admitted forging them, but even demonstrated the process in the BBC documentary. To bad that the local doctor, I mentioned before (Javier Cabrera Darquea), never fully recover from the impact of the stones and made quite a name for himself running a private museum of the stones and rambling about aliens from Pleiades.\n\nAnd finally we have **Nazca Lines**. It's probably most fitting entry in this list: it is- unquestionably- rather mysterious remains of ancient culture. D. Pillock shows his wast knowledge and research immediately by comparing them with crop circles (albeit, bout are man-made). And then went on to ramble about aliens and stuff.\nFrankly it's not even worth to dissect, because a) nothing of the substance was said b) it's just the same \"we don't know what it is exactly, hence aliens and forgotten mysteries\" routine.\n\nOn the whole, the entire video is just sloppy and hastily made as if resulting from 5 minute quick search on ancientorigins.net. The specter of objects it grabs is so broad that anything goes, really. Books, maps and petroglyphs each can be a subject for separate entry, but… Voynich was few entries lower in that quick search, so what a man suppose to do? Research?\n\nThe last thing to mention is underlying notion all bad history of this nature build on: essentially, the idea is that all books will have to be rewritten, long forgotten knowledge regained then **this** secret revealed. Entire our understating of the past will be blown away, rather that enriched by a new piece to our knowledge. Because our understanding of the past- the basic notion of pseudohistory goes- is not knowledge, but merely notion, that can be blown away. ",

        "text": "Greeting Badhistoriers! It is time for another review and, being the masochist that I am, I thought another bout with Deadliest Warrior! Would be suitable. So today I am covering Season 2, Episode 6: Roman Centurion Versus Rajput:\n\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x517l13\n\nAs Rajputs are a member of the Glorious Sanskrit Master Race, my imaginary alchohol shall be Royal Mawalin. So let us begin!\n\n0.12: HOLLYWOOD SPINNING! DRINK!\n\n0.23: So with the two warriors introduced, I find I have several objections to the matchup. Although centurions frequently fought in battle, they were officers first and foremost, and so the ability to command and maintain the loyalty of their men was far more important than their skill at dueling. Assuming the centurion comes from the Republican period, then they would be elected by the rank and file on the basis of how respected and competent they were. A good fighter does not automatically make a good leader. By comparison, the Rajput would have been raised from birth to be a warrior, and be incredibly proud of their heritage and religion. Although written much later than the period depicted in the episode, James Tod in \"Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan\" states that:\n\n'In the mythology of the Rajputs, of which we have a better idea from their heroic poetry than from the legends of the Brahmans, the sun-god is the deity they are most anxious to propitiate; and in his honour they fearlessly expend their blood in battle'\n\nThis is a culture that would not be well suited to drill and formation fighting, and so the two fighters have different styles of battle, varied skillsets and so cannot be compared to one another.\n\n1.21: The narrator says Rome had the first professional army. No. The first professional army was recruited by Sargon of Akkad, who had 5400 men. Other states prior to the Romans had standing forces  as well, such as the Achaemenids who maintained a central army of 20,000 men, DRINK!\n\n1.38: HOLLYWOOD WEAPON TWIRLING! DRINK!\n\n2.05: Quote of the day: \"My eyes sees physics for killing.\"\n\n2.40: Okay, so the first 'expert' is Terence Rotolo, whom a quick search on IMDB reveals he is a stunt coordinator and actor, and further searches using my Google-Fu has revealed no other information. So, not a historian or experimental archaeologist. DRINK!\n\n3.09: The next is Matt Lasky, who is also an actor and stuntman. Further searches reveal no academic credentials. DRINK!\n\n3.56: The narrator says that the dominance of Rome was because of it's full-time army. This is true, but it is worth pointing out that Rome had achieved super-power status during the Republican period by actually recruiting from its citizens for specific campaigns only. At that stage Rome raised armies based on need, rather than maintaining a standing force.\n\n4.44: The first Rajput expert is called Gugun Deep Singh, which sounds like the name of a character created by George Lucas. Gugun is an actor, and also a Canadian, which for some reason feels very wrong. Again, no background in history. DRINK!\n\n5.08: After this is Bhajneet Singh, yet another actor without any proficiency in history, as far as I can see. DRINK!\n\n6.07: The narrator states the Rajput fighting style was based on 10,000 year old martial art which was a forerunner of Kung-Fu. This sounds blatantly and hilariously wrong, but I don't know enough to about the subject to drink. I shall hold it in reserve until another user can clarify things. U/HumanMilkshake says that this claim is partially accurate, with the 10,000 statement being wrong. So, DRINK!\n\n7.12: HOLLYWOOD SPINNING!\n\n7.55: The first Rajput weapon is the Katar. Most sources and artwork I have seen indicate that the Katar was really only common from the 16th century AD onwards, such as this:\n\nhttp://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/view/19836024?width=3000&amp;height=3000\n\nMy instincts tell me associating this weapon with a 10th century AD Rajput warrior is highly anachronistic, so DRINK!\n\n7.58: The design of those weapons seem to date from the 17th century AD onwards, based on the collection here:\n\nhttp://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!?department=4&amp;perPage=100&amp;geolocation=India&amp;sortBy=Relevance&amp;sortOrder=asc&amp;offset=0&amp;pageSize=0\n\nDRINK!\n\n8.42: This test has finally convinced me that sharp pieces of metal can penetrate human skin. \n\n8.54: This carnage seems highly uncharacteristic of a Canadian.\n\n9.33 Annnnnnd now we have the super historical butted maille. A friend of mine, Thegn Thrand, discussed the inaccuracy of this here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmHdD_ngUps\n\nDRINK!\n\n9.52: Butted maille, placed over an object without padding, can be pierced easily. Whodathunk?\n\n10.42: The first Roman weapon is the...... dolabra, which was never a weapon. It was a construction tool. There is only one account of the dolabra being used offensively. Tacitus mentions that pickaxes were used to kill armoured gladiators:\n\nhttp://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/3C*.html\n\nAdditionally, as centurions were officers, they would not have used the dolobra anyway. Their job was to oversee, not dig.\n\nDRINK!\n\n11.38: One of the Rajput experts claims the Romans never faced a sword with the capacity of the Khanda. Yup, Romans never encountered deadly cutting blades like the Celtic broadsword, Iberian Falcata or Thraco-Dacian Falx. DRINK!\n\n13.20: Oh look, more butted maille. DRINK!\n\n19.03: That Scutum is about as unscutum as you can get. This is what it looked like:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/wATeq\n\nAn actual Scutum from Imperial rome looked like this:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/77/75/43/777543de643c1bf5d9bfc9ead46b5b95.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\nWell, that is all for now. Stay tuned for part two. Also, it is *very* hard to find information on early medieval Indian weaponry, or to locate scupltures which do not feature two people doing it.\n\nSources\n\nAnnals and Antiquities of Rajasthan, by James Tod:\n\nhttps://archive.org/stream/annalsantiquitie01todj/annalsantiquitie01todj_djvu.txt\n\nThe Complete Roman Army, by Adrian Goldsworthy\n\nThe Histories, by Polybius: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/42603\n\nIndia: The Ancient Past: A History of the Indian Subcontinent from c. 7000 BCE to CE 1200, by Burjor Avari\n\nRome and the Sword: How Warriors and Weapons Shaped Roman History, by Simon James",

        "text": "http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-radical-argument-of-the-new-oxford-shakespeare\n\n&gt; Late last year, Taylor shocked readers once again. The New Oxford Shakespeare, for which Taylor serves as lead general editor, is the first edition of the plays to credit Christopher Marlowe as a co-author of Shakespeare’s “Henry VI,” Parts 1, 2, and 3. It lists co-authors for fourteen other plays as well, ushering a host of playwrights—Thomas Nashe, George Peele, Thomas Heywood, Ben Jonson, George Wilkins, Thomas Middleton, and John Fletcher, along with Marlowe—into the big tent of the complete works. This past fall, headlines around the world trumpeted the Marlowe-Shakespeare connection, and spotlighted the editors’ methodology: computer-aided analysis of linguistic patterns across databases of early modern plays. “Shakespeare has now fully entered the era of Big Data,” Taylor announced in a press release.\n\nHere's the real issue, as noted in the above linked article...\n\n\n&gt; But there is a deeper argument made by the edition that is both less definitive and more interesting. It’s not just that Shakespeare collaborated with other playwrights, and it’s not just that Shakespeare was one of a number of great Renaissance writers whose fame he outstripped in the ensuing centuries. It’s that the canonization of Shakespeare has made his way of telling stories—especially his monarch-centered view of history—seem like the norm to us, when there are other ways of telling stories, and other ways of staging history, that other playwrights did better. If Shakespeare worshippers have told one story in order to discredit his contemporary rivals, the New Oxford is telling a story that aims to give the credit back.\n\n\nAnd that's where you're a bunch of self serving political brats, my petty Shakespeare conspiracists (now including Oxford, apparently).  No matter how much you try, you're not going to make Henry IV about the poor, downtrodden common man (at least not any more than Falstaff already accomplishes).  They're obviously adapted from the Holinshed Chronicles (1), of course they're about the monarchy.\n\n\nThe claim of \"textual analysis\" is also highly dubious. There are effectively three sources of the plays...  \n\n\nOne, there are what have been historically known as the 'bad quartos', versions of individual plays published in quarto format which were compiled however the publisher chose to compile them.  It is generally accepted from a scholarly standpoint that some were even composed from memory... an actor writes the text down as best he remembers it later, and sells/gives the text to someone who publishes it for their own financial gain (2).\n\n\nTwo, there are 'good quartos' which were published with some sort of reference material to work from, perhaps even with the author's blessing. Hamlet is an example in which we can compare a poorly compiled quarto against a lengthier quarto apparently from a better source, and compare them both against the first folio version (3).\n\n\nThree, there are anthologies in folio format.  The 'first' folio has been the authoritative text reference for Shakespeare for centuries.  It was compiled by John Heminges and Henry Condell, two actors who are verified to have worked directly with Shakespeare during his life.  This folio format publication contains the first printed editions of eighteen of the plays (4). It has also been speculated that the scribe tasked with maintaining the scripts for the acting company that Heminge and Condell worked for, Edward Knight, may have assisted in editing the first folio text (5).\n\n\nBut the kicker is that the 'first' folio was published seven years after Shakespeare's death. Therefore we know with certainty that Shakespeare himself, or whoever else wrote these plays, had no intention of publishing a *text* for sale or public reference.  If Shakespeare had intended to publish texts of the plays there was nothing stopping him from doing so, he was financially successful and had a close personal friend in the publishing business.  But he didn't, and if someone else wrote them they didn't do so either.  So the bottom line is that there is no authoritative text of these plays.  What we have is the best that could be assembled years after the fact by actors and perhaps one of their script keepers, and that's it.\n\n\nAll of which begs an obvious question.  If there is no authoritative text, how can the text that exists possibly be 'analyzed' to determine who wrote it?  If anyone can surely be given credit for the text, it's Heminges and Condell, but it doesn't take much 'analysis' to determine that, their names are right there in the book.\n\n\nThe preface to the First Folio published by Heminges and Condell states...\n\n&gt; It had bene a thing, we confesse, worthie to have bene wished, that the author himselfe had lived to have set forth, and overseen his owne writings; but since it hath bin ordain'd otherwise, and he by death departed from that right, we pray you do not envie his Friends, the office of their care, and paine, to have collected &amp; publish'd them; and so to have publish'd them, as where (before) you were abused with diverse stolne, and surreptitious copies, maimed, and deformed by the frauds and stealthes of injurious impostors, that expos'd them : even those, are now offer'd to your view cur'd, and perfect of their limbes; and all the rest, absolute in their numbers as he conceived them. Who, as he was a happie imitator of Nature, was a most gentle expresser of it. His mind and hand went together: And what he thought, he uttered with that easinesse, that wee have scarse received from him a blot in his papers. But it is not our province, who onely gather his works, and give them you, to praise him. It is yours that reade him.\n\n\nOxford University, of all people, has effectively disregarded the authors of an original text that still exists without contemporary text to refute those authors.  They are claiming that actors who knew the author of these plays personally, worked for him personally, are wrong.  They are claiming that these actors who are listed in the man's last will and testament as beneficiaries from his estate (6), whose names are printed next to his on an acting company's royal charter (7), are lying.  They are saying that they know better, because people should really like other playwrights more? Because they don't like the politics of plays about kings? Because Marlowe was gay and that's trendy now?  Because it keeps them in more research material that has otherwise long since been done already?\n\n\nWhatever the real reasons, literature departments have been awfully liberal with what we might call truth since the 1960s, but this in my opinion takes the cake.  The flagship university of England, the country responsible for the English language, has decided to tear down their country's most famous artist for either political or personal benefit of themselves.\n\n\nMacbeth's last soliloquy comes to mind in response to Oxford's contentions:\n\n*\"it is a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing*\"\n\n----------\n\n1.

That's as close as a \"historical Jesus\" as you can get.\n\nThis, IMO, is a good example of how you shouldn't let your ideology get in the way of the facts. /r/atheism has long been known for their advocacy of the Christ myth theory, despite the fact that the vast majority of scholars believe Jesus existed. \n\nIn fact, /r/atheism [hosted an AMA for an atheist New Testament scholar](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nbn08/lifelong_atheist_with_a_phd_in_new_testament_and/), and he strongly defended the historical Jesus:\n\n&gt; The best evidence is logic. It is much more reasonable to assume that someone named Jesus did exist and a (largely fanciful) cult developed around his personality than to assume that he didn't exist and people made up Christianity out of whole cloth. As I always point out when asked this question: if Jesus didn't exist, the easiest way for a non-Christian to debunk Christianity in the first century would have been to go to Nazareth and show that no one had ever heard of the man. But no 1st-2nd century non-Christians (specifically Jews) ever argued that Jesus didn't exist; they only argued that he wasn't Messiah.\n\nBart D. Ehrman, Ph.D, an agnostic Biblical scholar known for his criticism of Biblical literalism and popular books about the history of the Bible and early Christianity, [published a book dedicated entirely to defending the premise that Jesus existed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Did_Jesus_Exist%3F_\\(Ehrman\\))\n\nSo most scholars agree that Jesus existed, and it seems like the main motivator for refusing to believe he did is to avoid \"ceding\" any ground to Christianity. What they fail to understand is that acknowledging Jesus' historicity doesn't cede ground at all - Jews regard Jesus as real, but consider his resurrection an urban legend. Simply acknowledging that Jesus was a real person has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you think he was the Son of God. \n\nBest comment in the thread comes to a fairly accurate conclusion: \n\n&gt; I personally suspect Jesus existed in some form but not the miracle performing type. As did a whole lot of other apocalyptic preachers during that time frame. His is the only one that survived.\n\nOne user not only doesn't know the correct historical consensus on Jesus, they straight-up lie about it:\n\n&gt; If you asked 20 actual historians (most biblical scholars have no qualifications in history) to write you a couple of pages about, say Socrates, they would all be pretty much in agreement about who he was.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ask 20 biblical scholars to do the same for Jesus and you'll probably won't get even two agreeing on anything other than that He lived.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there really is a historical person behind the legend then you won't find him in the Bible, or in the words of scholars. He is long lost to history and all we have is the legend.\n\nThis, of course, is complete horseshit. For a brief summary of the historical consensus on what Jesus' life consisted of, Jesus was:\n\n1. A real person\n\n2. Baptized by John the Baptist \n\n3. Preached for many years with a group of devoted followers\n\n4. Crucified by Pontius Pilate\n\nJesus' existence is about as well-attested to as an obscure 1st century apocalyptic Jewish preacher could be - we have Josephus (most scholars agree the bit about him being resurrected was a Christian forgery but it came from a genuinely authentic account), Tacitus, and several other sources.\n\nEDIT: There are a handful of scholars who argue that Jesus didn't exist (Richard Carrier being the most prominent), but they are an extremely small minority.\n\nEDIT II: [I DIED FOR YOUR SINS](http://i.imgur.com/6wLVNvZ.png)",
