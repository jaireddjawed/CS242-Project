I thought I remembered them jumping over the fence with motorcycle and all, using a makeshift ramp built by Alex before he went to save Lena from her prison-house. But ofc I remembered wrong. Any other delirium fans here? Pls I need to share this pain. \n\nI also dont remember if Alex died or if he is said to have survived in later books. I HAD to google it but I didnt get a concrete answer. Whatever it is, I'll just believe he's survived and will be saved from the crypts by either Lena herself or other resistance friends",

        "text": "There's something to be said about an author who knows their strengths and knows the audience they've cultivated. I'm sure when I say formulaic writing, we all have a few authors who come to mind (Christie, Atwood, Patterson, Grisham, King, Green, etc.)  or maybe even entire genres (looking at you, mystery/thrillers). Personally, I think of John Green and his manic pixie dream girls that I read and re-read until I developed a complex (thank you 2013 Tumblr).  \n\nI got back into reading last year, and I've quickly succumbed to my former brain-child ways and have been absolutely devouring books. I recently fell down the BookTok rabbit hole, and read all of Ali Hazelwood's novels/novellas in the span of a week (as well as a few Tessa Bailey books). I've enjoyed them, probably more than I'll let myself admit, but after reading the second one (Love on the Brain), I knew she fell victim to the formulaic approach...I just didn't know the extent of it. \n\nI then read the STEMinist novellas, and it got worse. I saw someone on r/RomanceBooks say it felt like we were just rereading iterations of some fantasy that Hazelwood has been holding on to for years and I cannot shake that feeling. Seriously, how many times can one write about moody (but secretly sweet and sensitive), nerdy men built like Adonis who pine after petite, insecure, nerdy women for years? How many times can one write an enemies-to-lovers plot? I could complain about the sheer number of fanfiction tropes that permeate her works, but Hazelwood admits a lot of them started as fanfiction anyway so, good for her. Get that bag, queen!! \n\nI love her writing style, I just wish she'd write about slightly different characters. I don't want Adonis, I'd be perfectly fine with a slightly ugly but charming nerd. As a medium-sized girl, I definitely don't want another petite leading lady whose waist can be completely enveloped by nerd-Adonis' gigantic manly hands. \n\nOh, and I could complain about the repetitive smut that completely disregards statistics on the female orgasm...but I think most romance books do that because, well, it's fiction that's meant to make us feel good lol (I swear to god if someone comments \"um actually it happens for me!!\" I will throw my bottles of SSRI's at you). \n\nAll of that being said, I'm probably going to preorder Hazelwood's next book anyway and come back to complain, as one does. \n\nFinal side note: I find it hilarious that I've been obsessed with reading stories about these brilliant female scientists when I can barely do basic algebra without crying.",

I bought it when it was released because I thought it was an awesome concept, but alas, I never managed to read much of it. Because despite loving the idea, I just found the concept too exhausting for actual reading (and enjoying) the book. It was just so much stuff going on on each page and I felt pretty overwhelmed. \n\nHowever, I recently remembered the book just sitting there invitingly on my bookshelves, tempting me to have another go. But, same problem as last time, I‘m quite overwhelmed to actually enjoy it. \n\nOne issue is that I‘m just not sure what‘s the best way to read it: do I read the actual main book first and ignore all the additional comments in the margins or do I read them in parallel or is there some in-between solution (read a chapter of text and then go back to read the comments)? I tried different approaches and they all give me some kind of FOMO anxiety, because I fear I‘m reading it wrong and will miss something. I tried to look for some advice online but couldn‘t find much anymore. So I came here and hope that someone who read the book has some tips on the best approach to finally this really beautifully designed and created book. Thanks!",

        "text": "As soon as I opened the first page of David Foster Wallace's 'Infinite Jest,' I knew I was in for a ride. The intricate and complex narrative left me feeling dizzy and disoriented, yet I was captivated by the genius of the work.\n\nDays passed, and I found myself consumed by the novel, reading for hours on end until I started to feel ill. I couldn't eat, sleep or think of anything else but the story. Soon, I started to see strange things, hallucinating scenes from the book in my everyday life.\n\nBut as the story unfolded, something inside me clicked. The realization that writing could have such an impact on the human psyche was transformative. I became obsessed with the idea of writing a novel that could have the same effect on someone else.\n\nI picked up a tennis racket for the first time in years, inspired by the athletic and competitive themes woven throughout the book. Playing for hours on end, I found myself sweating, panting, and completely focused on the game.\n\nAnd then, an idea struck me. I decided to write my novel on pieces of toilet paper, each page filled with fragments of a larger story. I distributed the pieces in strange places, like abandoned alleyways, under park benches, and inside phone booths, hoping that someone would discover them and assemble the complete work.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the project became all-consuming. I spent every waking moment writing, refining, and distributing the work. Finally, one day, I received an email from someone who had found all the pieces and assembled the story.\n\nThe message read: \"Thank you for giving me a reason to believe in art again. Your work changed my life.\"\n\nI knew then that I had accomplished what I had set out to do. Infinite Jest had inspired me to write something transformative, something that could change the world. And while my novel may not have been as acclaimed or well-known, it had made a difference to at least one person, and that was enough.",

I generally like books of a specific genre and theme, but I try to read some of the classics, especially the subversive ones, for the cultural history as well as the book's innate value.  \n\n\nI'm struggling so much with this book, skipping paragraphs and straining to remember what is actually happening. It's not the content (especially since the narrator rarely explains things in brass-tacks terms), it's that Humbert is so loquacious, so detail-oriented, and so too-erudite-for-his-own-good. I can scarcely apprehend what's going on, both because so little seems to happen and because he will jaw on about frivolities at every opportunity. I literally didn't even pick up that &gt;!he and Lolita had had sex !&lt;until several chapters afterward, simply because he speaks around the actual plot so much and had filled the pages with all the details of their road trip.  \n\n\nI want to like the book so much, if only because I've not read a book with a word I've never heard on every other page since childhood, but if this guy lapses into French for no reason one more time...  \n\n\nIf you liked it, what shined through for you to enjoy the book? Did you get bogged down or \"take off points\" for similar reasons to me? Any other reasons you didn't like it?",

To be honest, I don't get awe from most other greats (Joyce, Hemingway; though Donna Tartt is closest), but Gravity's Rainbow is a book to stay with you for a lifetime. It may be that the scope is too much for many: European setting, American characters, and an intense mixture of wartime relationships, technology, social critique, politics and geography.

During the month of April, the sub book club will be reading **Sea of Tranquility** by Emily St. John Mandel! Each week, there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, Emily herself will be joining us for an AMA.\n\nFrom [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58446227-sea-of-tranquility) (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):\n\n&gt;Edwin St. Andrew is eighteen years old when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled from polite society following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner party. He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal--an experience that shocks him to his core.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She's traveling all over Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive's best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe. \n\nYou may find the dates of, and links to, the discussion threads below in the sticky comment on this post. You are welcome to read at your own pace. Usually it is pretty easy to catch up and you are always welcome to join the discussions a little later. If you would like to view potential content warnings for the book, a reader-created list may be found [here](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e55ebebb-6deb-4fee-9aff-6793c958b1fe/content_warnings).\n\nFor those of you that are viewing reddit on the redesigned desktop version you will see an option on this post to 'follow'. If you 'follow' the book club post you will receive a notification when a new post, a discussion thread for book club, is added to the collection.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1184q7r/i_liked_a_little_life_more_than_tomorrowx3/",
        "text": "&gt;! I was led to A Little Life after reading many reviews of Tomorrowx3 saying that A Little Life was a much better story about friendship, careers, and trauma. I have to agree, although I do like Tomorrowx3 and I do think A Little Life is overdone and flawed. I also have concerns about Hanya’s motivations and overall personality (but if I stop reading books by all authors who I disagree with, I’d have to cross out many childhood favorites…)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Spoilers on A Little Life below and references (though not really spoilers) for Tomorrowx3. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I have a very good friend who reminds me of Jude. She has not experienced the same horrors that were done to Jude but she also has many very different chapters of her life. She once said to me: “It feels like I’ve lived five different lives in my one little life.” I don’t think she was quoting the book’s title; I don’t believe the book was even out then, but I read the whole book from the framing of that time she told me her life story only to have the title horrifyingly come up through Brother Luke when he tells Jude to “show a little life.” I am not Willem but I felt like I couldn’t save her, especially after I moved states and stopped seeing her every single day, the timing of which coincided with a major mental health crisis that I was not there for. I also think of Casey Affleck’s line in Manchester-by-the-Sea when he says: “I just can’t beat it.” !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I meet many trauma survivors in my line of work and Jude’s story did not seem unrealistic or trauma porn-y to me (except for the Dr. Traylor section, which I pretend never happened). I was actually grateful because it made me understand for the very first time why people self-harm and how difficult it is for those in romantic relationships with them. This, along with the difficulty of intimacy in Willem’s and Jude’s relationship, was my favorite part of the book. I can be very impatient, especially with people who are insecure, and this book definitely helped me understand those feelings much better. I did not find Jude at all pathetic in his relationship with Willem although that behavior in general is so annoying to me - e.g., I could not STAND Sadie in Tomorrowx3 and did not understand her motivations at all. (Related: at least A Little Life isn’t apologizing for abuse, as Tomorrowx3 does - Dov is apparently completely forgiven for being a sadist asshole and kept around as a character for the entire book). !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I did not see Willem and Jude’s relationship as a gay relationship so much as an extension of their friendship, which helped this book still work as a book about friendship for me. Willem seemed, like Marx in Tomorrowx3, to be an actor who generally loves sex and people but also someone who identifies deeply with a caregiver role, starting with his brother. I have worked with many people in which the caregiver gets into a relationship with the care receiver and it would confuse me but I see it in Willem and Jude. He loved being a caregiver to his brother, he loves Jude, he wants to understand and fix Jude, and he is generally down for sex with whomever. It also had a “if we don’t find anyone else by 40” marriage pact vibe. On Jude’s part, I think he just wanted someone who loved him whom he could trust and physical affection. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!But I can’t decide how I feel about his death and the fact that we were stuck in Jude’s head for another 100 pages after that. It felt like a cheap narrative trope of: “tricked you! Actually the HEALTHY one suddenly dies first!” repeated in many cancer stories. On the other hand, I can’t decide what my preferred ending would be. I feel like we need Jude’s suicide and the impact of the suicide would be much worse if Willem was still alive. My most feared ending would be one where Willem and Jude had a falling out over his cutting, leading to Jude’s suicide. One option is to leave it ambiguous whether Jude died of illness or of suicide and end with Willem and Harold trying to decide which one it was and also feeling secretly relieved to no longer be caregivers. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Things I hated: !&lt;\n\n* &gt;!Jenny from Erich Segal’s “Love Story” is probably rolling over in her grave at all the apologies in this book. Not sure if she’s right that love means never having to say you’re sorry but still. !&lt;\n* &gt;!Why the needless killing of Andy in the last chapter??? He was my favorite character. I guess his inability to blur personal and professional lines got him in the end. !&lt;\n* &gt;!Ok also he reminds me so much of my own orthopedic surgeon, who told me that my “quad muscles were shit” and lectured me on what I should and shouldn’t be doing after knee surgery. His name is also Andy and he looks like Andy. But he is certainly not my friend or 24/7 on-call doctor. What would’ve happened to Jude if Andy was on vacation for one of his many emergencies?!&lt;\n* &gt;!Returning to Dr. Traylor and the home. The reason I hate this section is not because of the piling of more sexual abuse on Jude (I think that part unfortunately rings true to sexual abuse/child trafficking victims) but because it seems so unrealistic to me as an aftermath of FBI involvement. Once the FBI finds Brother Luke, wouldn’t they take some measures to protect and keep track of his victim and main witness to all the other men they can potentially locate? They have a well-staffed victim services division, they wouldn’t just throw him to a home to be abused more without followup. I did read that HY’s editors wanted her to pare down Jude’s previous abuse but she refused and said she didn’t care if no one else liked the book, and I have some reluctant admiration for that. !&lt;\n* &gt;!All the weird animal references to Jude’s traumas: the hyenas, the banshees, the creature inside him pawing and sniffing. It reminded me of when JKR would describe Harry Potter’s crush on Ginny as the “monster roaring in his chest.” !&lt;\n* &gt;!Why no female characters? Julia was listed so many times and never did anything. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!But when it comes down to it, A Little Life was gripping, gut-wrenching, and has staying power in my head to the detriment of my work and family and that’s not something you can say about most books. !&lt;",

It was the story of them all . . .  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the middle of the night, a woman wakes to find her beloved city engulfed in flames. Ten seemingly endless years of conflict between the Greeks and the Trojans are over. Troy has fallen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From the Trojan women whose fates now lie in the hands of the Greeks, to the Amazon princess who fought Achilles on their behalf, to Penelope awaiting the return of Odysseus, to the three goddesses whose feud started it all, these are the stories of the women whose lives, loves, and rivalries were forever altered by this long and tragic war.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A woman’s epic, powerfully imbued with new life, A Thousand Ships puts the women, girls and goddesses at the center of the Western world’s great tale ever told. \n\nYou may find the dates of, and links to, the discussion threads below in the sticky comment on this post.

It is even funnier when I read contemporary, untranslated works in my native language where there are fewer famous authors and they contain the recommendations of some lifestyle coach I never heard of. When did this start? Is it simply publishers adding quotes?",

I have terrible social anxiety and so this is a big deal for me. I read the book of the month and wrote down a few notes while reading. According to my librarian, typically 10-15 people show up to each meeting.\n\nI know it's nothing serious, but I'm hoping for some general ideas of what occurs at book club meetings you've gone to so I can calm my brain... Thank you in advance!",
