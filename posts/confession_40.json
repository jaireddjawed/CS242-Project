It was expensive, and I knew that I couldn't afford it, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. In a moment of weakness, I decided to take it without paying.\n\nSince then, I've been consumed with guilt. Every time I look at what I stole, I feel like a terrible person. I know that what I did was wrong, but I can't seem to shake the feeling that I got away with something. I keep thinking about the people who might be affected by my actions, from the store employees to the people who could have purchased the item if it was still on the shelf.\n\nI want to make things right, but I don't know how. I'm afraid to return the item and face the consequences of my actions. I'm also scared of getting caught and facing legal repercussions. I know that I shouldn't have stolen in the first place, but I can't change the past.\n\nI'm posting this confession to hold myself accountable and to hopefully get some advice. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I know that I need to take responsibility for my actions, but I don't know how to do that without making things worse.",

However why would God allow Me to be hit in the first place? And how do I know the purpose is a good one? Am I paying or was that me paying a karmic price? I'm not a perfect human being. We all have our dark sides. I know this isn't a hard core confession yet these questions really occupy my mind and I just needed to vent.",

So, I had this intrusive thoughts of just stealing some cash from my dad's saving like about 500 tk which is approximately 5 dollars. I took it right from the middle so its less obvious that I stole. But I don't want to lose my parents trust so in the last minute i chickened out and put where I stole the money from. I feel absolutely terrible to even have the thought of stealing from my parents.

I picked it up again the next night and did terribly. I died like 6 times in a row to start one game, and I was swearing and grumbling. The next game I died like 7 times in a row, and I got so mad I turned my Xbox off. Then it just felt like the right thing to do to reach around myself and grab the back of my shirt and pull. Just an expression of anger. Idk what I was expecting but of course the back of my shirt ripped apart and I pulled it right off my body. It was kinda cool at first but then I thought about how I just ruined a shirt for nothing and felt absolutely ridiculous.
