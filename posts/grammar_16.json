        "text": "I am going crazy trying to figure out the correct way to order and punctuate adjectives.\n\nSo basically, adjectives in English are said to proceed in a certain order: article adjectives/opinion/size/age/shape/color/material/type. Adjectives that are coordinate (of the same category) are supposed to have a comma between them: for instance, \"nice\" and \"lovely\" are both opinions and could be put in any order (either \"nice, lovely house\" or \"lovely, nice house\"), so they would need a comma between them. \"Nice\" and \"young,\" on the other hand, are not equal, because \"nice\" is an opinion and \"young\" describes age. They would have to be put in a specific order (with \"nice\" coming first) and would not need a comma.\n\nThis all makes sense in theory, but I get confused when I try to apply it. For instance, take the phrase: \"big, rollicking laugh.\" According to the rules, it seems like 1) these adjectives are in the wrong order, because \"rollicking\" describes an opinion and should therefore come first, and 2) they don't need a comma because they aren't coordinate adjectives (\"rollicking\" is an opinion, and \"big\" is size). Yet when I rewrite it as \"rollicking big laugh,\" it just looks wrong. \n\nAnyway, I wonder whether I'm overthinking this and should go with instinct rather than \"the rules.\"",

As a boy I hadn’t felt anything, but my leg split open like a tree truck.*  \n\nSo the tag, “As a boy” clearly indications that this is flashback.

I am also playing around with some alternative phrasing \n\n*1)  As a boy I hadn’t felt anything, I’d just watched my leg split open…*\n\n*2)  As a boy I hadn’t felt anything, but I remembered my leg splitting open…*\n\nOption 1 leads to two “I had” in one sentence\n\nOption 2 repeats “remember” which I hate.\n\nAny ideas here?

        "text": "I had two questions about ellipses. \n\n1) If a paragraph ends with a line of dialogue ending with an ellipses (as the character trails off) does it need a fourth period as terminal punctuation? For example, \"I want to get a dog, but....\"\n\nMLA seems to say yes. \"MLA style places the sentence-terminating period immediately after the last word of the quotation, even though a period does not occur there in the original material. The three ellipsis points are then placed after this sentence-terminating period.\" [https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/ellipses.html](https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/ellipses.html)\n\nBut most other sites I have found don't use this fourth period, and most published work I have read doesn't use it. Does this just come down to which style guide you are using? \n\n2) I am writing fiction and not used to space around ellipses. I was supposed to see how many site recommend spaces. Is it fine to use no spaces around ellipsis in fiction, as long as I am consistent? For example, \"One of these days...I'll learn it.\" \n\nThanks so much",

        "text": "As an avid fanfiction reader, I know that most authors write for fun, so I have to lower my expectations from either 'a lot' to 'not at all.' But one thing that really bothers me, is something that (I think) has to originate from 'their' own language. (their meaning, that the author is not from an english speaking country.) Is there a language that has the rule that you **don't** use a question mark, when a question is being asked, immediately after? And I don't mean an eastern language or a language that doesn't us abc script.\n\nBut anyway, I was reading this story of roughly 450K words, give or take, barely uses a period at the end of a sentence at all. Explanation: I download fanfics using a tool into html format, then I can open the story in one window. Like this, I can do searches like .\" or ,\" to see how many times they're being used. Or how many time a spelling mistake has been made.\n\nThe point is, that while I've learned that ,\" is appropriate sometimes, it ***isn't*** when a question is being asked just immediately after.\n\nSo!\n\n\"What are you doing,\" John Doe asked.\n\nThat. That is what I mean. In this case, it should be a question mark and nothing else. Now, I know that a coma CAN be appropriate, if the character is interrupted or if the character is explaining something. But in this case, the character is asking something, so why do people end the sentence with a coma!?\n\nSimilarly, and thankfully, I don't see this bit all that much, but I also see authors use a comma, question mark or period AFTER the quotation mark or both. Before AND after. Then there's the let's not use punctuation at ALL! Which makes me nope out of the story as soon as I notice it.\n\nSigh.\n\nI know that everyone has got to start from somewhere, and everyone makes mistakes. My own stories were so terrible, that I couldn't stomach going past the first page on word. So, yes, I had to learn too and English isn't my first language either.\n\nIn any case, I apologize for the half-rant, but I still have the genuine question.\n\n**IS there a language that has a rule, where you end sentences with coma's even when a question is being asked?**\n\n**Or where it is okay to put the point, coma question mark (whatever) AFTER the quotation mark?**\n\n**Or where a single quotation mark is acceptable as well?**\n\nIf you're still here, thanks for reading and hopefully, someone can give me an answer.\n\nP-W",

I am including it without any breaks. \n\n*My cup was half-filled when Mike burst out of the hotel.

This mean the new speaker starts the line, but leads to several short and choppy paragraphs. \n\nArgument 2) Break paragraph after the dialogue, so \"Cursing, I hid...\" starts a new line. This give a new paragraph when the focus shifts back to the narrator. \n\nI slightly prefer the first way, but I am not sure if the 2nd way is wrong.

        "text": "I'm getting pretty old now--mid-40s--and the evolution of the language from my youth to now has been interesting. A few things I've noticed:\n\nIn the past, \"respectively\" was used to clear up confusion around common or individual possession. Now it is added at the writer's discretion regardless of any possible confusion. \n\nPreviously, \"literally\" was used to indicate that no form of figurative language was being employed. Now it means something close to \"very much\" and has no bearing on whether your meaning is figurative or not.\n\n\"Lose\" is now spelled \"loose.\"\n\n\"Led\" is now spelled \"lead.\" There's no longer any spelling difference between the past and present tenses, but I assume there is still a pronunciation difference.\n\nThere used to be a difference between \"semicolon-however-comma\" and \"comma-however-comma.\" Now only the \"comma-however-comma\" version is used in both instances. I have to admit, I think the old distinction was necessary to quick reading of the sentence, but I'm able to figure it out from context eventually.\n\nThese changes have come about only in the last 20 or 30 years, so I'm excited to see what happens next.",

In AmE the word quite used as a qualifier is generally a reinforcement, though it is somewhat uncommon in actual colloquial American use today and carries an air of formality: for example, \"I'm quite hungry\" is a very polite way to say \"I'm very hungry\". In BrE quite (which is much more common in conversation) may have this meaning, as in \"quite right\" or \"quite mad\", but it more commonly means \"somewhat\", so that in BrE \"I'm quite hungry\" can mean \"I'm somewhat hungry\". This divergence of use can lead to misunderstanding.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the word \"quite\" means \"very\" in American English and \"somewhat\" in British English. I am more familiar with American English, but I could swear that I've heard British people use \"quite\" also to mean \"very.\" I can't really imagine \"quite\" meaning \"somewhat.\" So is it true that some dialects can have \"quite\" as a weaker adverb than \"very\"?",
