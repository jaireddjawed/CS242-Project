From what I know it all started when BBC put out a  documentary on the current Prime Minister of India, Modi, which implicates him for a genocide before he became the Prime Minister as I have gathered from this article by the Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/01/25/india-bbc-narendra-modi-documentary/\n\nI also decided to look up more about it and saw that he was actually cleared of the crimes by the Apex court of India - https://www.outlookindia.com/national/pm-modi-gets-clean-chit-in-2002-gujarat-riots-case-a-timeline-of-events-news-204382\n\nLooks like the case was resolved in 2012, so why a BBC documentary on Modi should create such a massive interest in Indian politics by the average redditor, which mostly are Americans? \n\nCalling the world's largest democracy as 'fascist' seems kind of overblown to me, so is there more to this than meets the eye or is it just something that got viral as nothing was more interesting, not suggesting a conspiracy, just am curious, I would genuinely like to know more and separate the facts from fiction.",

For example [this fairly dull set of clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncpeqy4sbIE) from *Hard Target* has twenty-four million views. It just doesn't seem plausible that tens of millions of people are interested in watching disjointed chunks of *Hard Target*. Or *Anaconda 3*, *The Pursuit of Happyness*, *Lake Placid*, random episodes of *Breaking Bad* etc.\n\nPresumably there's some kind of automated view-stuffing going on, but given that YouTube isn't a charity, how come the website hasn't spotted this? Or do they really have a huge following? The whole thing strikes me as completely automated.",
