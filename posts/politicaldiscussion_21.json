        "text": "Pedro was a poor villager, who struggled and later became a school teacher and a union leader; Doing so for over two decades. Despite being little known in urban areas, he became a candidate during the 2021 presidential election, and unexpectedly won the first round, edging out 17 other candidates. [**He went on to defeat Keiko Fujimori**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-57897402), the daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori and the favorite among business leaders.\n\nHis victory, by just 44,000 votes, was confirmed after a weeks-long counting process in which authorities reviewed a number of challenges from the Fujimori camp. \"The time has come to call on all sectors of society to build together... an inclusive Peru, a fair Peru, a Free Peru,\" he said.\n\nMr. Castillo managed to appeal to many Peruvians fed up with the corruption scandals which have overshadowed politics for years. He was propelled to the presidency by the same rural voters he grew up with.    \n\nWhen he ran for elections, one of his main promises was to call a referendum for an assembly to write a new constitution, to replace the current text enacted in 1993 under Alberto Fujimori. Mr. Castillo has called for a document that \"has the color, smell and flavor of the people\". \n\nThe leader recently announced that he was dissolving the Congress, introducing a curfew and using emergency powers to call new elections. The move was condemned by the constitutional court as a “coup d’état” and legislators soon gathered and overwhelmingly voted in favor of removing Castillo.\n\nThe former president was later arrested and accused of the crimes of “rebellion” and “conspiracy” for breaking the constitutional order. \n\nPeru is now in turmoil; the poor of the nation are outraged over the impeachment removal and detention of the former president and called for immediate elections \\[among other things\\]. The authorities have barred him from departing to Mexico where he was expected to be granted asylum. He was in fact detained by his own bodyguards on his way to the Mexican Embassy.  He is currently in detention and under investigation for alleged rebellion and conspiracy. \n\n\\[I note that the Mexican Embassy was subsequently able to take custody of his wife and two children and granted them Asylum.\\] \n\nAs an outsider, perhaps, I can understand the impeachment and removal process, but the detention is a little more difficult to comprehend. So, my question is, was detention necessary? \n\n [Pedro Castillo: The primary school teacher who became Peru's president - BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57941309) \n\n [Peru crisis: Family of ousted leader Castillo leaves for Mexico - BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-64047765) \n\n [Why was Peru President Pedro Castillo impeached? | Explainer News | Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/12/8/why-was-peru-president-pedro-castillo-impeached)",
