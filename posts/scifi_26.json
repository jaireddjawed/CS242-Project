It feels almost like Game of Thrones in space. Especially the political intrigue. Everyone seems intelligent but still very much vulnerable to mistakes. It’s brutal, hardcore, and props to Scott Brick for reading it with such voracity.  I’m afraid I’ll never find anything else like it. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Especially narrated by him. Also, I can’t help but to picture Anthony Starr as Nick Sorcorzo and Peter Stormare as Angus Thermopylae",

While the poor and less fortunate wouldn't get the benefits of transhumanism. So I wonder if class status would be the only limitation here though when it comes to transhumanism.\n\nI guessed two other mini-related questions I can ask here. 1: How common would these augmentations be in society? 2: Will everybody either have the same or different augmentations?\n\nSo back to the title question. Would class status be the only limitation when it comes to having access to these augmentations that would come with transhumanism? \n\nWould there be other ways people can still be limited, even if they are rich or have high status?",

This often results in events like grand scale wars to have no proper and natural impact on the storyline. \n\nThe Xeelee Sequence universe is so bleak, horrid, and shocking because literally nothing matters in the setting. This makes it highly unrealistic, pointless, and bland. It's also an example of how to not write grimdark or just a dark fictional  story in general.",

        "text": "I have fond memories of the James White Sector General series of novels. The premise was simple: a hospital in space with staff and patients from a wide variety of different races.\n\nThe different species often had radically different life support needs, physiology, language and appearance. \n\nMost of the stories centred around dealing with a challenging patient or situation in classic problem solving SF style. The medical staff were continually innovating and adapting which made for fascinating stories.\n\nThe regular cast of medical staff were reminiscent of a medical soap with some great alien characters such as the fragile insectile Dr Prilicla who was from a low gravity world and had problems using her armoured suit in higher gravity environments. \n\nThere was plenty of good natured humour in the interaction between the staff and some romance.\n\nThe aliens have a genuine diversity rather than just being humans with funny heads. The range of life support requirements is always an issue for the staff and patients often forming a basis for the story.\n\nGoogle tells me there were 12 books in the series and I admit I've not read them all but I remember the series with enjoyment as one of the few sci fi book series that did not centre around conflict. It was nice to read action packed classic space opera which wasn't all about shooting the bad guys.\n\nThis seems like fantastic material for a TV series. The large number of alien species would have been impossible or at least financially restrictive to portray in the past but now we have the technology.\n\nPeople love medical dramas and people love Sci Fi. Surely it's time has come.\n\nStarfleet Medical, Grey's Anatomy 2099, Star Wars ER, General Hospital Station.\n\nOkay we can work on the title......",

Let's assume that these bullets are very practical to produce\n\nLet's assume all of them are equipped with a digital scope that can see up to 10,000 meters away with digital zoom\n\nSo if these existed in the real world, how would it change warfare. I assume they'd be able to break through every defense and even hit fighter jets because the projectiles outspeed the fastest fighter jets in combat.

        "text": "I recently finished reading 'Three-Body Problem' by Liu Cixin and I have to say, it's one of the most mind-blowing books I've ever read. The story is set in a distant future where scientists discover a civilization on a distant planet called Trisolaris, and it explores the concept of first contact and the impact it has on humanity.\n\nThe author's imagination is incredible, the story is both philosophical and scientific, and it explores complex ideas such as the nature of humanity, the meaning of life, the possibility of other intelligent life in the universe, and the impact of advanced technology on society.\n\nBut what really sets this book apart is the way it makes you think. It forces you to question your assumptions and beliefs, it challenges your understanding of the world and it makes you ponder about the implications of the story's events long after you've finished reading.\n\nI highly recommend 'Three-Body Problem' to anyone who is interested in science fiction, and even if you're not a fan of the genre, I still think this book is worth reading. It's a thought-provoking and mind-bending read that will stay with you long after you've finished reading it.",

They were all chattering to each other in their high-pitched language that pinged off her frill and set the tips of her antenna tingling unpleasantly. She suppressed a compression and stepped to the side of the corridor, hoping that their agitation had nothing to do with her.\n\n“Doctor!” Twenty-Five Clicks called out, barely bringing his voice down into a polite range.\n\nSecond Sister sighed and laid her frill in a neutral flatness even if she couldn’t quite control the tight curl of her antenna. The Winged were so very impolite. But she had a job to do if they were using her work title instead of her name. She cast a single longing thought towards her comfortable perch in her chambers and then turned her attention to the approaching flight.\n\n“Base commander,” she greeted the Winged.\n\nThe thirty-odd little mammals spent a moment vying for the few surfaces on her body where they could perch and then the rest settled for clinging to the walls. They were still chattering worriedly among themselves but now their eyes were focused on their wing leader. Twenty-Five Clicks was clearly taking a moment to compose himself by grooming his sensory horns with his winghooks. Second Sister waited for him to finish with what she hoped was patience. He finally looked up into one of her eyes and took a deep breath. He pointed one wing towards the communal work space.\n\n“Human Friend Pierce,” he finally managed to say.\n\nSecond Sister fought the urge to extend her frill and simply began walking in the indicated direction. She should have known it would take some form of human madness to set the Winged to such frantic flight.\n\n“What precisely is the matter with Human Friend Pierce?” she asked.\n\nThe Undulate naming system that the Winged had adapted felt sticky on her mandibles, but she knew calling First Brother by his proper name would only confuse the flight of Winged further.  They were currently following her by hoping along the catwalks that lined the higher levels of the walls, avoiding flight in order to stay calm and focused. Finally one, presumable the flight medic, managed to speak.\n\n“He has taken severe outer membrane damage,” the medic said.\n\nSecond Sister tilted her head at him sharply.\n\n“What wasn’t this called in as a medical emergency?” She asked.\n\n“He insisted he was fine,” Twenty-Five Clicks interjected. “And he is not listed as a stupidly stubborn human in his records. We decided to get you to come analyze the damage before we set the alarms ringing.”\n\n“Reasonable,” Second Sister agreed as she paced along. “Humans are famous for being able to take damage to their outer membranes.”\n\n“Yes,” the flight medic agreed. “They are covered in that forest of micro-fauna that protects them.”\n\n“And they have that massive layer of fat under it all too,” another pointed out.\n\n“Landers,” Twenty-Five Clicks said in a grumbling tone.\n\n“Is there something you are hiding from me?” Second Sister finally asked bluntly.\n\nTellingly the entire flight fell silent as they approached the door to the communal work area. They glanced back and forth at each other, using their narrow binocular vision to avoid her broad gaze. Finally the medic spoke up.\n\n“We have speculation that we do not wish to share,” he explained, “as it is all but baseless.”\n\n“I would appreciate it,” Second Sister said curtly.\n\n“Well,” the medic squirmed from his perch on her primary joint. “The damage seems to be a reversed image of Undulate text. It appears random-”\n\n“But you fear that he may have deliberately applied the damage to himself,” Second Sister concluded. “That it is some form of ritual scarification?”\n\nAn uncomfortable murmur spread through the flight and Twenty-Five Clicks  fluffed himself out in indignation.\n\n“Human Friend Pierce is an exemplary Ranger,” he snapped. “He would not waste time on personal decoration of any sort while on duty.”\n\n“And this occurred while he was on duty?”  Second Sister asked.\n\n“Yes,” the medic hurriedly interjected. “He went into the tactile isolation console to work on his Undulate translation and had the damage when he came out.”\n\n“I thought he was doing field work today?” Second Sister asked.\n\n“He had a bad night,” Twenty-Five clicks explained. “Something to do with digestion and that new plant protein he tried yesterday, and he didn’t feel that he was competent to maneuver the transport safely. So he decided to work on his training.”\n\nSecond Sister clicked thoughtfully to herself as she opened the door. First Brother was at the far side of the large open space sipping a cup of the common human stimulant. He was slumping against the counter in that nearly Undulate way humans had when they were extremely tired. She eyed him critically.\n\n“Where exactly is this damage?” She asked the Winged.\n\n“Right on his face,” Twenty-Five Clicks said. “The wide fleshy part.”\n\nSecond Sister  gave a confused click and paced forward to get closer to the human. She heard a chatter of confusion start up among the Winged as they approached the human and the sound seemed to catch his notice. He lifted his head and blinked at them slowly.\n\n“Second Sis,” he greeted her before letting his oral cavity gape in an attempt to draw in more oxygen.\n\n“First Brother,” she replied with a polite tilt of her head.\n\nHe returned the gesture, causing the light to fall over one side of his face and she suddenly saw the damage the Winged had seen. There were indeed many reversed lines of the sprawling Undulate language imprinted on his epidermis.\n\n“It was way worse!” one of the Winged above her insisted.\n\n“What was worse lil guy?” First Brother asked, squinting up at him.\n\n“Your face,” Second Sister informed him.\n\nHe stared blankly at her and she reached up to grasp his chin with one hand, turning his face to examine the damage. His eyes tracked hers in that rolling, disconcerted way humans did for a few seconds until he burst out laughing.\n\n“Something’s wrong with my face?” he asked.\n\n“You have taken damage,” she replied. “It looks like pressure damage.”\n\nThe human gave one of those deep lunged grunts that only his giant mammalian lungs could produce and easily pulled his chin out of her grasp. He turned to the reflective surface of the nutrient warming device and titled his head to get a look at the fading marks.\n\n“Ah,” he said, “I fell asleep while practicing Undulate touch writing. The reversed grooves must have left these marks.”\n\n“Do they pose any danger to you?” Second Sister asked.\n\n“Nah,” the human dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand. “S’like corduroy line or whatnot.”\n\n“That give me no relevant information,” Second Sister pointed out.\n\nFirst Brother stared at her with blank, unfocused eyes for several long moments, giving Second Sister plentiful time to assess the situation. The Winged were still disturbed and the human was clearly not operating at full mental capacity.\n\n“First Brother,” she said firmly. “It is my opinion as the base medic that you should spend the rest of the day resting in your quarters.”\n\n“But,” whatever First Brother was about to say in protest was lost in a massive yawn that seemed to stretch out his spine and curl his entire body in odd directions.\n\n“Maybe you got a point,” he said when the yawn was done. “I’ll get back to bed.”\n\n“And this flight will escort you,” Second Sister said quickly.\n\n“Sure, sure,” First Brother said, holding out his hands invitingly as he shuffled towards the door.\n\nThe Winged followed their Human Friend Pierce eagerly, abandoning Second Sister to the blissful silence of the now empty work space. If she hurried she might be able to make it back to her perch before there was another medical oddity.\n\n# \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ahil6nnb14ca1.gif\n\n# Please go leave a review on my 3rd book \"Humans are Weird: Let's Work it Out\"\n\n## [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n## [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n## [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n## [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)",

        "text": "If you're interested in hard sci-fi and issues of interstellar travel but packaged in an exciting story, I've been making an audio drama series 253 Mathilde which is free (with no ads) at [https://www.quietplease.org/253/](https://www.quietplease.org/253/) . Think of it kind of like if The Expanse hadn't resorted to magic rings and protomolecules, or Charles Chilton's Journey Into Space if you're familiar with that.\n\nIt takes place in the 22nd and 23rd centuries on a generational asteroid ship which has been underway for about a century. Unlike most stories with that premise, nobody has forgotten they're in space nor reverted to a primitive state... it's neither dystopia nor utopia. There is conflict about whether to keep going or turn around and head home. None of the people alive at this point signed up for the mission, they were born into it... but those who did sign up are still in living memory, and they're still in regular contact with Earth despite the 7 months needed to get a reply to a question from the Oort cloud.\n\nI put a lot of effort and research into making this as realistic as I can, and went into some detail about it on the \"Making of\" documentary. 253 Mathilde is a bigger asteroid than you'd probably really want to pick as your spaceship, but I needed it to have a little gravity. The timeline of launching a crewed asteroid in the early 22nd century is incredibly soon, but I made it plausible via help from alien visitors who are centuries ahead technologically and see the project as a way to get themselves home.\n\nSeason 2, which takes place 22 years after season 1, makes the speed of travel a bit less realistic with constant accelerations of 0.1 G which have gotten asteroid up to 0.75 C. With this season I'm getting into the issue of how the exploration of a new star system would be conducted. Decelerating an asteroid to enter the system is slow and wasteful. Flying an asteroid through a system at relativistic speeds would be a recipe for lots of energetic explosions and not much observation time. So my proposal is a tiny deceleration pod, designed for one person, which is paired with a fuel tanker orders of magnitude larger. Thanks to the low mass, it's able to bleed off the 0.75 C in a matter of 6 weeks to enter the system while the asteroid itself continues onward. Of course, that makes the pod a one way mission and opens up some ethical issues.\n\nAnother issue of season 2 is relativistic kinetic weapons and the dark forest theory, but with a bit of a different take on it than Liu Cixin's.\n\nSeason 3 will deal with passing the point of no return, where you're traveling so fast that you no longer have enough propellant mass left in your asteroid to slow down if you wanted to.",

Some examples of my favorite series would be: A Song of Ice and Fire, the Poppy War trilogy and the Farseer series.\n\nI'm kind of growing tired of the whole fantasy thing though and thought I'd try scifi out for change. I have never read anything scifi though so I have no frame of reference on where to start. So I was wondering if you guys could give me any recommendations based on my taste in fantasy books.",

Maybe you can help me with the author and title? \n\nThe first one was about a human that lived  inside an alien organism which was attacked by a similar alien that also something inside it. They both shape shifted and devised all sorts of strategies, shells,organic weapons. The whole story I think was narrated as a story to the offspring, maybe? \n\nThe other one was about Native Americans tradition. As I remember it was about creating an infinite trench, that looked to have a small width for all \"good\" people, but one that could not be crossed by the enemies. The thing was that the \"spell\" required some impossible to find ingredients, but somehow the protagonist pulls it off using some modern substitution and belief.\n\nDo you think you can help me out?
