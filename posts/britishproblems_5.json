        "text": " Hello UK,\n\nLooking  for some advise, information and whatnot about TV License and how it is  very crucial, mandatory and important to have one. I've already been  fighting myself over it in the last couple years, wanting to go the  lawful way and send them notification that I will be NOT renewing but as  much as I gather, they snoop around your place then, not sure looking  for what exactly but since I do own a TV (do not watch it live), how am I  supposed to prove that I don't use it for what most people use it?\n\nSo,  here I am, not wanting to pay another £160 as I have better ways of  spending this amount of money and would appreciate any tips, guides and  simple stories of how are you managin it (or not) and if any of you  actually had to pay whatever the fine it is once you get \"caught\". As  mentioned, I don't watch any live transmitions, my TV is for all the  already monthly based services like Netflix, Amazon, Disney and what not  and for gaming. I feel like TV Licensing should do the same and give  people choice rather than piling nice sum and asking to pay it but what  do I know.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your input, I might break out this year and just give up on it finally.",

I repeatedly find that the electric heaters that are widely used are either too warm or too cold. \n\nIn addition, I have never experienced a shower in the UK where I can comfortably set my desired temperature to 1/2 degree.\nHave I experienced too few hotels/hostels and holiday homes, or are these perceptions basically evident? If so, do you have an explanation?",
