He's now forced to push his moped along this poorly lit road all the way till he gets home.\n\nAt some point, somewhere out of the dark, he hears a voice yelling \"greasy sparkplug!\"\n\nThe man jumps and turns towards the source of the sound, only to see a black horse looking at him. Suddenly the horse shouts at him saying \"greasy sparkplug!\"\n\nThe man doesn't know what he's seeing nor hearing, but he removes the sparkplug from his moped and inspects it, only to see that it is in fact covered in oil. He wipes it clean and reinstalls it. He turns the key and his moped comes to life again!\n\nHe rides home, and decides to go to the farmer who owns the field the following day to ask him about this strange encounter. Once he's found and greeted the farmer, he tells him what happened that night. To which the farmer replied:\n\nAh yes, that's possible. Was it the black horse or the white one?\n\nThe black one, he replied.\n\nGood, the farmer said. Because the white one knows nothing about mopeds.",

And what's more, they've been making them in different colors and themes! Apparently, people have even started a black market for them because they sell out of these boxes all the time!

Satisfied, he bellows at the top of his lungs, “I’ve just arrived from America, and I’ve heard tell of how much the Irish drink stout. I’ve got $500 for anyone who can drink ten pints of Guinness in ten minutes or less.” He pulls out a wad of cash and smashes it down on the bar.   \n\nThe barkeep chortles. The crowd looks about in silence for a second, then all go back to their conversations. One patron actually gets up and leaves.  \n\nThe American is a little perplexed, but calls out an order for a pint, which he starts to drink.  \n\nA few minutes later the door opens and the guy who left earlier barges up to the American. “Aren’t you the fella who made a wager?”  \n\nThe American’s eyes light up and he says, “Yep, that’s me. I’ll give you $500 if you can drink ten pints of Guinness is ten minutes or less.”  \n\nThe Irish lad says, “Alright, I’ll take your wager.” And they call out for the bartender to line up ten pints. The crowd at the bar starts to get interested and they gather around the American fella and the Irish lad. The American pulls back the cuff of his shirt to see his watch and tells the Irish lad when to start. The crowd starts to cheers as the Irish lad pours the pints down his throat, as if he’d greased his throat with bacon fat before he started.\n\nSure enough, the crowd roars as he swallows the last gulp out of the tenth pint and the American exclaims, “Nine minutes and thirteen seconds!” He picks up the wad of cash and hands it to the Irish lad, and says, “I’ve just got to ask. Aren’t you the guy who left when I first called out my wager?” The Irish lad confirms he left, and the American asks where he went.  \n\nHe says, “I had to go to the pub next door to make sure I could do it!”",

Raised in the ways of the modern world, the chief had never been taught the old secrets and had no way of knowing whether the winter would be cold or mild. To be on the safe side, he advised the tribe to collect wood and be prepared for a cold winter. A few days later, as a practical afterthought, he called the National Weather Service and asked whether they were forecasting a cold winter. The meteorologist replied that, indeed, he thought the winter would be quite cold. The chief advised the tribe to stock even more wood.\n\nA couple of weeks later, the chief checked in again with the Weather Service. \"Does it still look like a cold winter?\" asked the chief.\n\n\"It sure does,\" replied the meteorologist. \"It looks like a very cold winter.\" The chief advised the tribe to gather up every scrap of wood they could find.\n\nA couple of weeks later, the chief called the Weather Service again and asked how the winter was looking at that point. The meteorologist said, \"We're now forecasting that it will be one of the coldest winters on record!\"\n\"Really?\" said the chief. \"How can you be so sure?\"\n\nThe meteorologist replied, \"The Indians are collecting wood like crazy!\"",
