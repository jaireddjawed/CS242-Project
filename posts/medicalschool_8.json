I can live with paying for 3rd year because our schools set up our rotations and pay hospitals/preceptors/malpractice insurance and so on for our core rotations. \n\nMost people in my class set up their 4th year rotations without any support. My school also does not pay preceptors during 4th year. Yes, there is malpractice insurance but I'm genuinely interested where the rest of the horrendous amount of money goes?? Has anyone ever requested an itemized list of expenses they have if we're not on campus and don't use any of their resources? Has anyone ever tried to challenge these expenses in court?\n\nThanks fam!",

I am unsure if the weights are the best, but i think the methodology is simple and easy enough to put together with a little bit of time. I am curious if you all would agree with this methodology and whether it needs some adjustments. \n\nI decided to make the entire ranking system out of 11 possible points which when added will be a medical schools index score. I am unsure if the weighting will result in the ability to cross-compare schools, but if the rankings are sub divided further we can get more valuable information. 3 sub categories: student outcomes, exam scores, residency outcomes,  \n\nStudent Outcomes (3 points total):\n\n1 \\* %students with debt (schools incentivized to give aid or reject low ses students)\n\n1 \\* graduation rate (so they dont fail students to protect their rank)\n\n1 \\* % of medical specialties of graduating students (informs students about what specialty option are available\n\nExam Scores (4 points total):\n\n1 \\* 1st time step 1 pass rate (how good the school prepares you for exams)\n\n1 \\* ultimate step 1 pass rate (quality of remediation)\n\n1 \\* (median step 2 score / 300) (preparation for licensure)\n\n1 \\* (median step 2 ck score / 300) (preparation for licensure)\n\nResidency Outcomes (4 points total):\n\n1 \\* % accepted to 1st choice program\n\n1 \\* % accepted to top 3 choice program\n\n1 - % students who SOAP\n\n1 - % of students who SOAP and do not match\n\nI think what is surely missing from this ranking methodology is the clinical experience during M3 and M4. I am unsure on how to incorporate those very important aspects of medical education in an objective way. I would like your advice on how you would generate a ranking methodology for clinicals and if what I have put together here is of any use to anyone? I think rankings are important as they provide students a clear picture of what makes a good medical school and informs a student about what is lacking at institutions they were accepted to.",

He said “Haha, of course it was the medical student. We’re doing X, and we’ve consented the patient already.”\n\nI understand plans change, and I know that I personally did not make any mistakes. But I feel bad because now I feel my resident and attending (both in the room when we called back) don’t trust me as being able to understand and communicate information. I tried not to get defensive to them, I just said “I read back the plan to him, and he confirmed.” Ugh.",

Im not exactly sure what I’m supposed to do because I was assigned one patient and I present on them daily and just see them every morning before rounds. In the afternoon I check on the patient again or go with the intern to basically shadow. The residents said they generally don’t let students write up notes. I feel like I’m not learning anything besides how to present. I ask what to do to help but there isn’t much to do that they assign me anyways. I have built good rapport with the residents and the intern and I ask questions not just to look interested but because I genuinely want to know things. They seem receptive to that. I’ve been pimped here and there and answered pretty much all of them. Am I doing something wrong?",

I hear that not only will they pay for 100% of medical school, but they will also pay out stipends so you can have some income during medical school. I know that the trade off is that you’ll have to serve in the military for each year you were on scholarship but that doesn’t sound too bad. Looking for more insight on the pros/cons of this from people that know more about it and have decided to accept a military scholarship or decline one. Also, for those that have gone through the whole military scholarship process and served I would like to know what their experience has been like and if they’d be willing to make that decision again if they could go back in time.

        "text": "With scope creep becoming more of an issue every year, a rapidly expanding population of osteopathic physicians, and a general population that is largely unaware of the DO degree, the distinction is on track to muddy the push towards physician led care.\n\nMy argument- The clear solution is to allow all acgme residency trained physicians to represent themselves as Medical doctors (MDs) similar to MBBS, MB ChB, and other IMGs with non MD degrees awarded. \n\nIf a patient ever wants more information on my education, they can look me up and clearly see that I've attended an Osteopathic School. If that inspires any further questioning I would be happy to elaborate on the distinction.\n\nThis solution is ideal, as DOs who are strongly attached to osteopathic principles and practices can still wear their banner with pride, while allowing DOs practicing in majority MD settings to avoid role confusion.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Its a hassle because i'm already stressed about potentially having to remediate the year and they're pushing other stuff on us last minute...but i'm torn because i also have no idea what specialties to even start looking into as a preliminary narrowing down.\n\nTo the M4s who just applied for match and any residents here, how accurate do you think these surveys were? did you end up liking, applying, or matching into the specialties it paired you with? Any other people have anecdotes?",

        "text": "Hey all, this is part 4 of a guide to medical school. This part focuses on rotations.\n\nHere's Part 1, where I wrote about the [general mindset](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/10s77ts/a_guide_to_medical_school_things_i_wish_i_knew/) \n\nHere's Part 2, where I wrote about [boards studying](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/10xb3u6/a_guide_to_medical_school_boards_part_2/)\n\nHere's Part 3, where I wrote about [research/publications](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/11azqrs/a_guide_to_medical_school_things_i_wish_i_knew/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m writing this as a fourth-year currently applying for residency in a competitive surgical subspecialty. I got 250+ on both boards, 20+ research pubs in a year without prior experience, finished away rotations, and completed interviews.\n\nHopefully I match but even if i don't I will not regret writing this if at least one reader benefits.\n\nI wrote this because there are many things I regret doing in medical school.\n\nI sorely wish I had someone who warned me ahead of time. I could have saved a lot of time, energy, emotional wellbeing.\n\nThis guide is basically composed of the things I wish I knew, and is written for first, second, third year, and early fourth years.\n\nAs my time in medical school comes to a close, I'm hoping to help at least one of you, since posts from random strangers on this subreddit helped me a ton throughout my med school journey.\n\n=================\n\n# Part 4: Clinical Rotations\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rotation evaluations are so subjective, which sucks...but there are some things you can do to optimize them.** \n\nSome of these principles are universal, but some will apply more to some schools than others. \n\nAs with all my past posts, I ask that you take every advice with a grain of salt. Always thoroughly evaluate the person giving advice. \n\nAs for my background on this topic, I honored all third year rotations except for my general surgery rotation. I did however complete nine total surgical subspecialty away rotations including 3rd/4th year rotations, honored them all, and got very positive feedback. I know this sounds crazy to some of you, but my school is very flexible with 4th year schedule and I had time for some “unofficial” rotations ( i will talk more about this later)\n\nDoing well on clinical rotations requires the following steps\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Pick the best rotations\n2. Be a team player\n3. Clinical Knowledge / Skills\n4. Doing well on Shelf \n5. (BONUS) Unofficial rotation hustle\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Pick the best rotations\n\nIf your school doesn’t allow you to pick any rotations, you can feel free to skip this part. \n\nHowever, if they do, **picking the best rotations is actually the first step to doing well**. \n\nYou have to understand that **rotation grading is totally subjective. Your grade on a rotation can make some impact on you matching or not.** \n\nSome preceptors give all students top marks. \n\nSome preceptors give all students lowest marks. \n\nFor example, I had a preceptor on surgery who told me i was one of the best students he has seen in years. He ended up giving me high pass (which is second highest marks). He said i was the first person he gave a high pass to in a while, and that honors was only reserved for those who were literally at a resident level. While to him this was a huge compliment since he passes everyone, he ended up hurting my likelihood of matching since this was a surgery rotation. \n\nOn the other hand, some of my classmates barely showed up to their rotations and their preceptors gave them all honors because they didn’t care at all. \n\nWhile its important to get a good education, remember that ultimately you are in medical school to match. Do your homework and pick rotations where you can achieve your goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Pass the Team Player test\n\nOnce you’re at a rotation, the most MOST important thing is your ability to be team player. \n\nWAY more important i’d say than even your actual clinical knowledge/skill. \n\nAs a medical student, you have to understand, everyone’s expectations of you is EXTREMELY low. \n\nHere’s how you do well on rotations:\n\n**FIRST, don’t get in the way / don’t be annoying**\n\n**SECOND (BONUS), add some value, be helpful**\n\n**THIRD (BONUS), be likeable and someone they want to hangout with**\n\nOnce you are not in the way, THEN you can work on adding value to the team. Once you add value to the team, THEN you can work on being likeable. \n\nWhen I asked upperclassmen for advice, i'd often here things like:\n\n“don’t be weird”\n\nor \n\n“just be yourself”\n\nWhat the hell does this mean?!\n\nI realized what it really means is “don’t be annoying and don’t get int he way”\n\nTo be honest, almost everyone (including myself) has gotten in the way or has been annoying at some point on their rotations. \n\nIt’s pretty much unavoidable. **You are a person without an assigned role taking up space and without real knowledge or experience.** \n\nTherefore, if you can at least not get in the way / not be annoying, you’re probably already above average. \n\nHere are some rules I regularly follow, and still follow in professional settings when i do not know anyone:\n\n1. Always show up 10 minutes beforehand with all required items\n2. Think about what you want to say, then speak 80% less words than you wanted to \n3. Think about what you want to do, then move 80% less than you normally wanted to \n4. Always be ready and happy to immediately help \n5. Only help if: 1) you are asked 2) you are 110% confident your help is needed \n6. Position yourself in space where you don’t get in anyone’s way\n7. If in doubt, do not say it, do not do it. \n8. Do not interrupt when a resident is doing something\n9. If getting pimped in a group with residents around, do NOT answer it unless the attending asks you specifically. If you’re not sure, you can ask “were you asking me?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Clinical Knowledge and Skill\n\nAs far as preceptor evaluation, your knowledge doesn’t matter THAT much.\n\nAs i said in the previous section, attendings/residents know that you dont’ know shit. \n\nThat said, **as far as clinical knowledge/ skills go, there’s only two things that matter.**\n\n1. **Not getting the same thing wrong twice**\n2. **Not being totally clueless relevant to peers**\n\nWhat its really evaluating is\n\n1. Are you someone who cares about improving?\n2. Are you someone who does their homework?\n\nNote that its really  not even as much an evaluation of your knowledge as it is of your character, which matters way more to them. \n\nOf course there's some variance about this point so adapt accordingly. But by and large what I've noticed is that being a great team player / having solid character is more important than your actual level of knowledge as long as you don't get the same thing wrong twice and you're not way below the level of your peers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Doing well on Shelf\n\nMy process for doing well on my shelves was the following:\n\n1. **Quick pass (&lt;5 days) through a comprehensive knowledge resource like OME, First Aid, BnB**\n2. **Multiple passes through UWorld qbank**\n\nThe key here is to do as much UWorld as possible. \n\nYou do NOT need much content review at this point since you already took Step 1. \n\nAlso, download the UWorld app on your phone. Do sets on tutor mode at first. Keep doing it during downtime in your rotation. If you’re taking a shit do a few UWorld qs on your phone. \n\nThe strategy here is not going to be the same as for Step 1. \n\nYou usually do not have a lot of time to truly sit down at your computer and review properly.  \n\nWhat you want to aim for is at least two passes of UWorld for the rotation you're on.. \n\nSo take the number of questions you have for that topic, and the days you have until your shelf, and divdie questions by days minus 7, that will be your questions per day to complete the bank 7 days before the shelf. Then the week before the shelf, do the questions again with timed random 40 sets. \n\nThis strategy was sufficient for me and several of my classmates to get at least get honors (top 10 percentile). \n\nThat said, I did this pre Step 1 (P/F). Not sure if / how the curve will change for you guys so take this advice with a grain of salt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The unofficial rotation hustle (bonus)\n\nThis is going to be a controversial point, especially for any administrators out there reading this. \n\nThink about how you got exposure to medicine in high school or undergrad. You would shadow. Would you always do so officially? Most people had some unofficial shadowing where some faculty, family friend, or someone allowed them to follow for a few days to get shadowing hours. \n\nYou can do the same thing in medical school, except now you know more, have more skills, and are way more motivated and focused. \n\nAlso, you’ll find that **many “official” rotations you have are in actuality the same as shadowing.** \n\nThe amount that preceptors let you do on an unoffiical rotation is really up to them, but in my experience students have gotten to do a lot including sometimes OR procedures.  \n\nA guy i rotated with didn’t match. He emailed numerous different programs in a surgical subspecialty (all community programs) and was able to line up six two week “shadowing” unofficial rotations between March and June. He continued doing these unofficial rotations during a research year. He ended up doing twelve unofficial rotations and got twelve interviews. From what he told me he got to do plenty of ED and even OR procedures. From what i understood, most if not all were “unofficial”.\n\n**If you’re an MS1/2/3, you can potentially start doing these “unofficial rotations” at target programs and get an early win as far as locking in interviews, experience, and deciding whether you want to do a certain specialty.** \n\nI've found that physicians/surgeons in general love the hustle and hate admin. **The only thing really blocking you from an unofficial rotation is admin.** Admin loves making arbitrary rules to protect themselves from contingencies. **Admin doesn't care about your hustle, they don’t care about your specific goals, they just care about keeping their job.** \n\nYou ultimately need to fight for what you want. If you are going to a no name school without any connections like i did, these unofficial rotations can be a huge difference maker. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n=====\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask ANY question you might be curious about. I have a bunch of time these next few weeks, so I'm happy to help anyone who may need it. \n\nPS: If you happen to be someone preparing for Step/COMLEX 1/2 but are at the bottom of your class / fear failing, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'd like to help. I've coached a few people in those situations already to passing scores.",

I want to do a specialty with variety and if possible that can get to give emotional support to patients, or have deep bonds. Someone told me about doing oncology because I also like palliative care, but I feel oncology would be too heavy for me.
