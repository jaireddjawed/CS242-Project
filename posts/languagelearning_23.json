        "text": "Long time ago, when this subreddit certainly didn’t have as many subscribers as it does now, I was busy staying up to date with all the famous polyglots online, including Luca Lampariello.\n\nHe showed up on my YouTube feed and \nI am curious how much progress he has made with learning Asian languages such as Chinese. I didn’t want to go down the rabbit hole once again but saw that there is this video from 2 years ago that’s titled Polyglot Speaking in 11 Languages. There is a segment in which he speaks Chinese. \nHe doesn’t sound fluent. Are there any more recent videos that shows his progress with the language?\n\nBefore anyone of you misunderstand, I don’t have any interest in undermining his achievements. And there is nothing to gain from comparing his level to mine. I am just quiet curious. Is he having difficulty learning Chinese? And if so, is it that his method only works for languages similar to the ones he already knows? But I think he achieved a certain proficiency in Russian, right?\n\nSo I am just curious. \n\nIf anyone of you can share more recent news in regards to this, please do. Thank you.",

Also, let me presage that I am completely ignorant on the Thai language and thus would appreciate any and all pointers.\n\nThat being said, here is the background: I am currently working with a team on translating a project from English into Thai. During the final formatting of the document we kept running into layout issues for the Thai language where a lot of terms would need to be split correctly since they appeared rather dense and thus did not split naturally correctly. \n\nWe tried to use zero-width spacing for some of them but the language team insisted this has less to do with the individual words but rather with words that are just long.\n\nHaving gone over the material, it appears from a European and Latin language based perspective, that the Thai language is rather dense and doesn’t appear to have the traditional Latin spacing between words.\n\nIs this a correct understanding of the language or am I misunderstanding the issue?",

I'll put **it** above the fireplace.\"\n\nAll of these words would need to agree to the gender of fabergé. But, what if the wife doesn't know what *it* is? Not to pat my own language on the back, but the great benefit and purpose of the English word *it* is that you DON'T NEED TO IDENTIFY THAT TO WHICH IS REFERS.\n\nBut in Spanish (and other Romance languages, I assume), you pretty much need to always identify the noun in your head before referring to it in any way. Or do I have it wrong?\n\nThe second thing is, even after we learn what objects are called, they're not always immediately available in the mind--- sometimes recalling the name of an object could take a moment, and more often then not we'll completely forgo the recall process and simply choose a pronoun to replace it (ie, \"it.\").\n\nFor example, take the following conversation in English:\n\nMary: Here, put **it** in the box.\n\nJohn: Put what in the box?\n\nMary: That in your hand. **You know, the, uh, ...gemstone.**\n\nThis conversation couldn't exist in Spanish/Italian/French, right? Because Mary would have never needed to recall the word \"gemstone\" in line 3, because to speak Spanish she would have already had to have identified it in her mind so that she could refer to it at all in line one.

I will gladly take the risk of any word from any language somehow overwriting a word in my native language.\n\nBut, whenever I encounter a word in a potential target language that looks and sounds exactly like one in my current target language, it feels like by trying to learn that word, I would be actively destroying another word that I have put \\*so much time and effort\\* into absorbing as deeply as possible.\n\nI want to cross this hurdle sooner or later but I don't like the looks of it.

I've decided to try studying an Indian language and am torn between learning Hindi or Bengali, but am leaning toward Bengali. (My college sadly doesn't offer either, so this would be studying on my own initially.) My reasons for Bengali are as follows:\n\n1. The literature and cinema seems amazing. (I'm more a Satyajit Ray than a Bollywood girl).\n2. The grammar seems simpler (no genders, etc., but maybe I'm missing something?)\n3. For whatever reason, most of my Indian-American friends are Bengali.\n\nI'm starting to have second thoughts, though. There seem to be a TON more resources for Hindi (Duolingo doesn't cover Bengali, when they literally have a program for KLINGON). And if I ever do get to travel to India, it seems like Hindi will be much more of a lingua franca.\n\nAnyway, I'm curious if anyone wants to share their experiences learning either of these languages and their two cents about which I should pick. And if you happen to have learned Sanskrit or Tamil, I'd love to hear about that, too!",

I have friends who even admit they don't remember how they started to speak English they just did because it just came to them at some point.\n\nMethods like Refold similarly advocate for delayed output citing that eventually when your comprehension is at a fluent level, output should come with relative ease and without too much stress (although practice is still needed of course).\n\nTo those who are fluent speakers what do you think about this perspective? Did your TL just \"click\" one day for you in regard to your output? Thanks in advance :  )",

I don't want to know the language of the enemy.\n\nIn my opinion, the system of teaching languages in school is pretty terrible. It's really diffcult to acheive proficiency that way. It might work for English, bur definitely not other languages, because English is the only language that is so ubiquitous, so children get to practice it outside of school.\n\nWhat do you think?

        "text": "I'm sure someone has done this before and written about it. I just wanted to because what I've been doing has really helped me get going. I use it for both Korean and Japanese. Korean I'm intermediate level and Japanese is beginner.\n\n**Setup:**\n\nI have four windows on my PC open.\n\n1) TV Show with Target Language Audio and Native Language Subtitles\n\n2) Same TV Show with Target Language Audio and Target Language Captions\n\n3) Dictionary App (or paper dictionary as sometimes I just like physically searching)\n\n4) Obsidian/Notion/Notetaking App (could also use pen and paper, I used to use a Rocketbook)\n\n**Method:**\n\nI was originally watching the whole episode with English Subs and then rewatching with Native Subs. That wasn't working well for me so I switched it up. I now literally pause after every sentence and then would watch the video with Target Subs and pause at the same points.  So I leap frog the show kind of.\n\n1. Watch show with Native Subs and pause after every sentence.\n2. Watch show with Target Subs and pause.\n3. Look up every word I didn't know and put them into a table (or lookup only words that catch your eye).\n4. I use a grammar parser if there is grammar I don't know. I do not write down the grammar though you can if you want.\n5. I write down the sentence if it isn't super long or too confusing in the table. I'll add the sentence by the last word I had to look up.\n6. Repeat for next sentence.\n\nHere is an example table I have in Obsidian:\n\n|Korean |English|Korean Sentence|English Sentence|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|몰래 |secretly|||\n|숨어들다|to sneak in|||\n|맞닥뜨리다|to run into, bump into| 그 때 이 방에 몰래 숨어든 저 남자와 맞닥뜨리게 되서 | Because at that time you bumped into that man who snuck into this room |\n| 뒷받침하다 |to support, backup| 하지만 뒷받침할 증거는 있습니다 |But there is evidence to support it |\n\n**Other Notes:**\n\n* You can just look up whatever you want, I generally **LIKE** looking up every single one. If you don't like doing that then just look up whatever ones catch your fancy.\n* I **DO NOT** review my notes. I write them because it helps it get stuck in my brain.\n*  I **DO NOT** care if I learn i've written down a word before. If I get that feeling of \"oh I should remember/know this\" I do not let it bother me. Forgetting is part of learning.\n* I **DO NOT** use a pop-up dictionary. I used to use this for stuff but I found I forget words a lot more often and have to look them up a lot more than if I force myself to type it into a dictionary and then type/write it into my notes. I know pop-up dictionaries are great at high levels for just random words so don't think I hate it.\n* I **DO NOT** use Anki or Supermemo or Quizlet or (Insert Flashcard App Here) anymore. I can't stand flashcards most of the time. You can preach all you want about the efficiency of SRS but there is no point to it if I find it boring or dull. It makes me hate the language. I just get natural repetition from input and forget about \"optimized spacing\"\n* If you're a beginner this method is rough so I'd study some other way to get a little familiar before using this method.  I use this method for Japanese, it does work but requires a ton of effort so it may not be for you. \n* If you want you can just use a show in some other language that has Target Language Subs and Native Language Subs. Or Native Language Audio with Target Language Subs. I'm currently watching Detective Conan. Which in America I can't find the Korean Dub so I'm using Japanese with English Subs and Japanese with Korean Subs. I also did this with Star Trek for Korean which doesn't have Dub at all so I watched English with Korean Subs. Only downside is it doesn't help your listening but if you're enjoying it and it keeps you going then it is worth it.\n* If you try this and do not like it then please stop trying to do it.\n\nIf something is unclear then let me know I'll try to clear it up for you.\n\nAlso sorry for any errors, using the mobile app to type this.",

Just to make things easier to visualize, this means that I will have:  \n\n\nListened to 730 hours (\\~30.5 days) of podcasts that are not beginner level. Podcasts like El Panda Show, La Cotorisa, La Corneta, Historia Para Tontos. Basically podcasts designed for native speakers.  \n\n\n182.5 hours (\\~8 days) of either speaking, watching shows, or reviewing cards in Spanish.  \n\n\nLater in the year, I will also start making Spanish-speaking friends and start participating more in the Hispanic community here  \n\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "Hi \n\nI'm having a little rough time trying to make a routine for language learning, I'll explain.\n\nLast year I came up with the idea to study more languages because I love them and i want to comunicate, read or watch content in other languages. Since I've learned English (a must) I wanted to go further, I wanted to retake my little french knowledge and also learn german, the next language in the list. I wanted to learn them by myself I know is possible and I would be more proud of it.\n\nI started with german because I found some great resources online (Nicos weg) so, i had no problems with it. The problem was french, I did not found any good free resources which could give me the same satisfaction as Nicos weg (I compared all learning resources with this course)\n\nSo after trying and compiling different sites and exercices I felt like i was not learning that much french as german (I kept a dual language learning system). I gave up in french and I decided to continue with german.\n\nBut german had another problem, I began doing lesser and lesser lessons (or blocks) and made them take longer to reach, I became more precautious because I didn't want to only learn the lesson and go on, i needed to review the vocabulary so I did that to.\n\nThe new year begun and I reorganize myself to be more productive and make goals more archieveable, I read that i could archieve them if I break my goals in pieces little enough to make study effortless, and therefore make me more motivated.\n\nI decided to do 1 lesson (12-18 exercices) and 30-50 words from vocabulary (of all lessons already taken) to make the goal archiveable. The problem is the web now wont let me practice the vocabulary (because status code 400 (i think this means vocabulary tables are that large that the practice won't start)) and i can only review 10 last lessons, 3 last lessons or the last lesson taken (this is not enough i'm now in lesson 70 and i know i still dont have all lessons vocabulary learned). \n\nThis stupid thing made me dissapointed enough that now i cant progress because i dont want to lose vocabulary lessons and is like im in that same feeling i had with french, i'm stuck. \n\n***So what are some advices to retake this?, what little tasks can i do to make studying a language a daily goal? How do you break your lessons to be easy enough? In case of german how could i split it?***\n\nPS: I know for vocabulary apps like anki but i dont feel enough attached to this and also the vocabulary in Nicos Weg is the necesary for this first steps, It have things like slang, expressions and is very well executed and easy in my oipinion.",

Any feedback appreciated.\n\nThe languages I have a history with are:\n\n* English (native), \n* Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic), \n* German (a bit higher than Secondary school/middle school level, learned for 5-ish years), \n* French (barely remember! Has been nearly a decade since last using, learned for 3-ish years), \n* Mandarin (barely remember, been over a decade, learned for 3-ish years)\n\nThe languages I hope to refresh are all the above (basically relearning all of French and Mandarin) and Urdu, Hindi, Spanish, Portugese, Russian, potentially Dutch, potentially Japanese, potentially Korean\n\nI have a relatively solid memory of German (Confident reading, writing and pronounciation I'm good at, have forgotten a lot of vocabulary from lack of usage, speaking/listening are also issues too).\n\nI was thinking about blocking them up like this, learning from top to bottom:\n\nBlock 1\n\n* Arabic \n* Urdu (as same writing system as Arabic with some style differences)\n* Hindi (as same as Urdu outside of the writing system)\n\nBlock 2\n\n* German\n* Dutch (always reminds me of German whenever I see it, I'm sure it's similar!)\n* French\\*\n* Spanish\\*\n* Portguese\\*\n\n\\* Not sure best order for these\n\nBlock 3\n\n* Mandarin\n* Japanese (since I believe their Kanji is from Mandarin)\n* Korean (the trifecta!)\n\nBlock 4\n\n* Russian (don't think it's similar to any of the others)\n\nAny feedback for orders would be appreciated (or any useful/wide-spread languages to throw in the mix that would be easy to learn after learning the others, maybe italian?)\n\nThank you!",

But at most I picked up a tourist on a vacation level of the language.  \n\n \nBut everytime I try, pick up apps like Duolingo, get books, watch learning videos ect I get a headache really quickly and feel so discouraged and I know that it's not going to be like English and I'm going to have to actually put in a lot of efforts to be able to learn it and hold conversations but it feels like a mountain. \n\nHas anyone felt like that at the start of learning a language?

        "text": "Salut tout le monde!\n\nFull disclosure: I'm launching a free pronunciation workshop soon, but wanted to help as many of you as possible, even if you don't join. So I'll be posting tips and tricks every day until we begin on 06/02!\n\nFirst of all, **the idiom of the day: What does \"C'est Du Gâteau\" mean?** If you've never come across that phrase before, have a go at translating it and give me your best shot in the comments!\n\nBien. Et maintenant, here are 5 tips to help you improve your pronunciation of challenging words and sentences:\n\n1. **Syllable-by-syllable:** Divide the word or sentence into syllables and tackle each one separately. This way, you can focus on each individual sound and pronunciation with ease. Start slow, then build up the speed and blend all syllables. Example: a - é - ro - port\n2. **Spot the tricky bits:** Identify the sounds that give you trouble and make a mental note of them. Practise the sounds with a variety of similar words. Example: psychologie, psychiatre... Don't be afraid to use your hand gestures or facial expressions to help you remember how to form these sounds with your mouth and tongue.\n3. **Listen and repeat:** Listen to native French speakers pronouncing the words or sentences and try to imitate them as closely as possible. Don't be shy, have fun with it! Try to capture the rhythm, stress, and intonation of the language by tapping your feet or nodding your head. Example: learning French songs is a great way to study pronunciation as well as flow\n4. **Practice makes perfect:** The more you practice, the better you'll get. So, repeat the difficult words or sentences as often as you can, and don't be discouraged if you make mistakes. The goal is to keep trying until you can say them correctly and smoothly. Example: I'll admit it, as a French person, I hate pronouncing \"hierarchy\"... So I look for any opportunity to say it lol!\n5. **Feedback is your friend**: Seek feedback from a native speaker or pronunciation expert, such as in my upcoming free pronunciation workshop! Here, you'll get detailed feedback on your pronunciation and suggestions on how to improve and practice. With personalised attention and guidance, you'll be able to track your progress and see real results in no time! Check out the [Accent Challenge Workshop](https://www.quirkyfrench.com/accentchallenge)  \n for more info!\n\nWhat tips do you use when dealing with hard words? I would love to hear from you! If you have any tips or tricks, please share in the comments below.\n\nTomorrow, I'll be posting a brand new tip that will show you how to use specific tools that you already have to practice pronunciation like a pro, even if you don't know French speakers to get feedback from! Get ready to sharpen your skills and feel confident speaking French like a native!\n\nÀ demain!",

I used the Google Translate API and I added English to the mix. It's a pretty good translation for what I have seen (in the last few year it has become much better).\n\nI had worked throgh the book a few years back but I have always wanted to keep working on the sentences this way. It's very practical, in my opinion, to practice pronounciation, understanding and conversation (I intend to reverse the deck and produce the phrases in Italian when prompted).\n\nThis are the decks that I made:\n\nAssimil L'Italien (2004) \\[French and English\\] (122 notes) The first 10 lessons\n\n[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1158807192](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1158807192)\n\nAssimil L'Italien (2004) \\[French &amp; English\\] (7 full lessons) (13 notes)\n\n[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/397266941](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/397266941)\n\nThis deck has the main lesson, then the pack of exercises. That's why has 13 since the revision lessons don't usually have those.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Single sentence version](https://preview.redd.it/1px7jog5ckfa1.jpg?width=929&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=42be027a5ad3d3437946514d41ca1fa0100a4faa)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Full lessons version](https://preview.redd.it/ca4lupf7ckfa1.jpg?width=926&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3338bc71f79f4b57d28ab5dbf21e1fa7391e78a3)\n\nThis took quite a lot of effort. I'm by no means an experience programmer and the audio trimming was a nightmare! The audio files of the lessons have no much regularity to work with!\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think of these kind of material. I'd might be doing a lot more of these. Maybe you can suggest other types of italian materials to do the same.\n\nI hope it helps your studies!",

        "text": "For a class project turned language learning startup, my classmates and I interviewed over a hundred students and teachers about their experiences with language education. **We knew that language learning was broken; we just didn’t know why yet.** Who better to catch up with than my dear friend Sam: the least pretentious Frenchman you’ll ever meet (even if he is devoutly religious)? Sam and I met in Spain where we became friends in English, and he lived in Italy for years teaching French to local kids. As a well-traveled polyglot with years of teaching experience and a mischievous sense of humor, he was just the man for this mission.\n\n**“Language should never be taught in the classroom,”** Sam wasted no time in saying. I laughed, thinking he was exaggerating, but I quickly realized he was serious despite his grin. Sam was frustrated by how afraid his Italian students were to speak in class, overwhelmed by the anxiety of making a mistake and embarrassing themselves. Their need to be correct was preventing them from saying anything at all, defeating the entire point of learning a language!\n\nThe problem, Sam explained, was that a classroom focuses on right and wrong answers, **but language is far too flexible to be shoehorned into a score or grade**. Native speakers misspeak all the time, and even if someone makes a mistake every sentence, we can usually understand what they’re saying. Once we get used to how someone speaks, we often forget the errors entirely, piecing together the meaning even if the sentences wouldn’t earn a passing grade on an exam.\n\nGetting language out of the classroom forces us to scrounge up whatever words we have, mistakes or not. It puts conversation in true-to-life contexts instead of the nonsense we get in apps and textbooks like, “The boy eats the red apple.” Most importantly, **it makes the mistakes we inevitably make delightful**, even a way of connecting with the people around you if you have a sense of humor about it. \n\nBefore I get carried away, I should confess that I’m enough of a nerd that I found some of the Spanish grammar I got in high school pretty helpful. Class has its place, especially in those rare cases where language follows a structure that we can apply in new situations. It’s only thanks to hours of drills that I can comfortably use subjunctives, perfects, you name it. But lord knows I’ll slip up in conversation, and it’s only thanks to my time with Spanish outside of the classroom that I take that mistake as the sign of growth, practice, and humor that it deserves to be.\n\nI’ve thought about this much more than I should, and I’ve settled here: **a classroom or traditional app can help us go from nothing to something in a new language, but the sooner we can get it out into the real world, the better.** Of course, it can be scary to jump into a conversation with a native speaker right away, so we at BeSpoken made a way to [practice real conversations without a live human on the other end](https://www.bespokenlanguage.com). Do you think it's helpful? If so, what other language do you think we should try this concept on (currently we only offer English)? What other ways do you find useful to get language out of the classroom?",
