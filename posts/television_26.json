Many correctly assumed the novel would be hard to translate into film but it seems this show has taken the right approach by taking its time and exploring what some might consider the less flashy interpersonal/character development sides of the story.\n\nIf you are ok following with subtitles, and somewhat curious about 'current' Chinese culture/media or what they want to represent in the media, it is very interesting!\n\nI could definitely see a generation being influenced by this in many ways: increased curiosity re: science, eco awareness etc. You can tell they had very high aspirations for this.\n\nAll in all, highly recommend if you enjoyed the book.  Might be a bit hard to follow/grasp without having read the book first considering language barrier/names and other reasons which would be spoilery to divulge",

My thoughts on it first and foremost are it is a good, solid show. They nail the realism as everyone praises it for. It's entertaining throughout and some of the dialogue is very high level.\n\nThe issue I have with the show is it's very anticlimactic, and while that may be true to the real world, it doesn't make for as entertaining a TV show as the other greats it often gets mentioned with. This is the largest problem with the show. \n\n Honestly, as many other greats before it, it just feels outdated at this point and has not aged well. The intro is low quality which is something that has really changed in modern TV.  Most characters aren't very likeable. Which again, while maybe realistic, makes for a worse TV show with a few exceptions. \n\nIt really matters how we judge shows though ultimately, for its time I do think it was great. However, it is no longer and I believe it rides on nostalgia. Compare that to the other goats(breaking bad, sopranos, dexter, etc) that are commonly mentioned and they all hold up better.\n\nSo anyways, what do you guys think? Do you disagree? Anything I'm missing?",
