        "text": "I've watched up to s2e2, and considering how this show is mostly about dystopian futures, I can't seem to actually enjoy it, or find how any of it could actually happen. I heard so much about how depressing this show is, but for me it hasn't lived up to the hype yet. The best way to explain my feelings toward it is its not \"vicarious\" enough. \n\nA couple examples:\n\ns1e1: From the outcome of the \"event\", It seems to be the best possible ending for the prime minister. Sure, his wife hates him, but all in all he has a shit ton of respect by the end of it. Why she doesnt leave is beyond me, as she continues to pretend everything's alright publicly, yet hates his guts. Is this realistic? Who knows, but I was 100% sure he was going to kill himself before that scene.\n\ns1e2: I was joyfully surprised when i seen the guy from Get Out.  The world he was living in seemed interesting, but the microtransaction system didn't seem to have a lot of thought behind it. I was confused why things were the way they were, and nothing was explained how things got so demented. Again, I thought the protagonist would do more than just a speech. I was expecting a rampage, or maybe even him destroying the system, and bringing about an even worse era of leadership. Nope, he became a part of the system. \n\ns1e3: What happened to the wife at the end? Did the husband kick her out? Did he kill her? We just see the \"ghost\" memory of her walking up the stairs. the technology ruined a relationship, but wouldn't this have been a better concept to use as a means to government monitoring the public? The concept shown is terribly bleak and narrow. He could've looked at cctv footage from the bar they visited and it would've had the same outcome.\n\ns2e1: Why this would even be a thing is beyond me. the marketers for this type of technology would make more money by selling robotic butlers instead of focusing on deceased loved ones to get over something as trivial as grief. The backlash alone would derail the company in modern society. Also, the protagonist suddenly decided one morning to just get rid of it for no other reason other than \"it's not realistic enough\". How much money would that have been down the drain if she actually just pushed it off a cliff? \n\nthis was literally a happy ending. the daughter got to see 90% of what once was her father. \n\ns2e2: I thought she was a robotic A.I being hunted for sport, which i believe would have been a better story. But she ended up being a real person, being used for money, by a recreational park, indefinitely, for the entertainment of people dim enough to blame someone who filmed a murder,  to be charged with 1st degree murder, when the real murderer is actually already dead. And the reason everyone wanted to film it? SHE WAS THE ONE WHO FILMED THE MURDER! OH WOW! ITS FULL CIRCLE! SO GENIUS! \n\nThis was my final straw before quitting the show.  It takes its audience and just dumps concepts interesting enough to pull people in, but then dumps all those concepts into a bin for the sole purpose of making their overall theme of \"technology might not be good for humanity\" seem realistic. Maybe im thinking too much when watching the show. Maybe when you limit concepts to a single episode, it feels like so much is lost on that episode. Maybe im too depressed to actually enjoy anything.\n\n\n\n\n",

I’m not sure if it’s the uneasiness of a simulation being possible, or something about love, but I’m thoroughly shaken up about it. I watched an entire other episode, played video games for a couple hours, and I just can’t get it out of my mind. Wondering if anyone else was hit so hard by this one?",

        "text": "My idea begins with an overall level that is calculated based on a combination of your attribute levels. Maybe even have a class that if you align your attributes toward that class you'll have a higher overall level. \n\nNext you would have individual attributes. Think like the same kind of attributes you would have for a video game; strength, charisma, intellect, etc. Within those attributes would be subcategories for example public speaking may be a sub for charisma. Somehow (haven't worked out the kinks), doing certain activities boosts these attribute levels. You might read a novel to increase your empathy stat. Maybe you'll drink some coffee to temporarily increase your focus numbers. Again attributes contribute to your overall level. \n\nWhere the black mirror level of fuckery comes in is that everyone has read-only access to this Information about everyone else. Perhaps it's available in an app on your phone (like the nosedive episode). They affect things like your employment, ability to perform certain tasks, and social life. \n\nGone are the days of resumes and cover letters. Instead, employers judge you off of attributes like work ethic, composure, professional speaking and the like. Congratulations, you just got a job as an electrician because the HR rep likes your electrical aptitude levels. You can also say goodbye to making it into that college, admissions says your math level isn't what they would call high. \n\nTrying to impress an attractive girl at a bar with stories about your time in the army? Too bad she doesn't care, she's only worried about your attributes. She loves that you're good at making jokes and still show chivalry is not dead in 2018, but she hates that you're bad in bed and and have low levels of affection... According to your attribute levels.\n\nSay you've just returned from a Navy deployment to the South China Sea. You lovingly greet your wife but, she notices right away that your commitment and trust attribute numbers have dipped considerably since you left 6 months ago. Maybe even hers have dipped slightly as well...\n\nObviously there are some cool melodramas you could write into this sort of idea. I think it'd be a neat idea and wanted to share. Thanks for reading. \n\n",

The part that scares me is how much I agree with his argument about how hateful words shouldn't be thoughtlessly thrown around online. On top of that, the #Deathto movement was an aweful trend. It takes a special sort of evil to wish death to someone based off a mistake made in the spotlight of social media. \n\nThey show Jo Powers who wrote a particularly nasty post, and Tusk who made some douchebag comments to a 9 year old, in ear shot of the kid. So yeah, one could argue that the hate was justified with those two. But then we get a young lady who drunkenly made the mistake of being obnoxious. Not really deserving of a death sentence at all. THEN we are introduced to the poor woman who attempted suicide due to the overwhelming hate directed at her because of an innocent mistake.\n\nUnfortunately for the 379k people who were using the hashtag, Garrett Sholes cared about this woman. It was the catalyst to the entire tragedy.   People need to understand how much impact their own words can potentially have on someone. What is the best way to do this? Make them accountable for their blind, unsympathetic hate.\n\nI understand his logic. The question I've been asking myself is this, Who is most to blame for the events? Garett set up the system which lead to the horrible deaths of all those online assholes, but the NSA agent pushed the button. Even though it was brought to light that a man this meticulous wouldnt leave crumbs to follow. They stopped to think about it but the NSA guy insists on pushing button. Jack Kevorkian helped terminally ill patients, who could not endure the suffering any longer, to commit suicide. He just built the machine to help end their lives, the patients pushed the button and they tried pinning him with the deaths. Im aware of how different the two situations are but I still havnt found a concrete, acceptable answer to the question i ask you now,  Who is to blame, the asshole  people/Garett Sholes/NSA agent? When he sits down to give his recollection of the events that happened last May, the NSA agent's body language did not indicate confidence. Let me know what you think.",

It might behave like the person and seem to have all the same emotions but how do we know they're self aware like us? The computer makes it behave so but that doesn't have to mean it is.\n\nBut anyway, if the cookie version of a person is actually self aware, this came to mind. The cookie remembers the original's entire life and believes they're the real them. But they do not remember the decision and process it took for it to start existing. I think it should remember that. If they're able to erase those memories, they should be able to program them to be more obedient too. And what's the point of making them forget it if they're told later anyway? (except the interrogation maybe) \n\nSo, let's pretend they do remember.\n\nIf this service really existed, the people who choose to use it can't be sure if their conscience ends up as the real person or as the cookie. It just gets split into two copies and you could actually be the copy that ends up in the eggy thing. How would we know this life we're living now isn't just a cookie's memory? Imagine that, deciding to make a little helper for your house only to end up as them. And this would happen every time. If it wasn't you, it would be the other you that only gets made afterwards but is already in the process of making for your entire life. It's scary. I really don't think people would use it that often if it meant the risk of becoming the cookie themselves. Which would inherently have to happen if they're actually conscious like many of you believe.\n\nIt's a mindfuck. ",

The subject matter seems to be the focus of their lives (e.g. the bikes generating money, social status controlling privileges, post apocalyptic world) and I’ve been thinking about what could have caused these things were they real. Honestly it’s been bothering me for a while, I’d like to understand how the world could become like that. I understand that it could due to social media etc in the future, but I can’t realistically picture a future in that our world is completely ruled by one thing. 15 Million Merits is my main one about this, I cannot imagine how we could get to a place where we are in that position; “exercising” for money in a purely virtual world, but at the same time I can. If anyone can understand what I’m asking I’ll be impressed; I’m not even sure what I’m asking lol. ",

They are then slaughtered by the government.\n\nTax rises every year and more and more people cannot afford it, but live in fear due to the shroud of danger thats placed over not being 'safe' and seeing more and more 'terrorists' being killed. \n\n\nA possible story arc linked to this could be from a working class person's struggle to pay the tax, and them getting desperate, before coming into a load of money due to a lottery win and their problems easing. Then when theyre comfortable they realise the true nature of the system and that theyre paying to have poor people murdered. \n\nThey then begin to work for the government and into power, before setting the tax level upto  a level unaffordable for all but the richest people. \n\n",

The movie is a good representation, though there are some confusing parts that you really have to understand. It’s like a realization. And its getting late and I don’t know how to sleep thinking about this. Also I’d like to ask, is Mar on be right back actually told her daughter that it is her father a clone or such? And what do you think that represents in our lives? ",
