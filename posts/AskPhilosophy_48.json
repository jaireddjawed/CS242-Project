Has any philosopher ever explicitly positioned themselves as a sort of 'metaphysician of presence', tried to respond to Heidegger, Derrida, and others, and argued that the 'metaphysics of presence' is a viable (or even *the* only viable) approach (that we should return to)?",

        "text": "David Lewis has been one of the most influential philosophers of the modern age. Many of his followers and philosophical influencers talk about him with reverence and love to interpret his work in a similar manner that we still do with Plato and Aristotle. Lewis is most famous for defending one of his most famous positions when it comes to the metaphysics of modality and that is a position that has come to be known as “modal realism” or “extreme modal realism” by Alexander Pruss. Modality in philosophy deals with necessity, contingency, possibility, and so on. A possible world is a complete and consistent way the world is or could have been.\n\nModal realism defended by Lewis is the view that there are many possible worlds and and that they are concrete entities of the same kind as the world we live in. It is based on the following tenets: possible worlds exist; possible worlds are not different in kind from the actual world; possible worlds are irreducible entities; the term actual in actual world is indexical, i.e. any subject can declare their world to be the actual one, much as they label the place they are \"here\" and the time they are \"now\". At the heart of it, their are six central ideas:\n1. Possible worlds exist – they are just as real as our world;\n2. Possible worlds are the same sort of things as our world – they differ in content, not in kind;\n3. Possible worlds cannot be reduced to something more basic – they are irreducible entities in their own right.\n4. Actuality is indexical. When we distinguish our world from other possible worlds by claiming that it alone is actual, we mean only that it is our world.\n5. Possible worlds are unified by the spatiotemporal interrelations of their parts; every world is spatiotemporally isolated from every other world.\n6. Possible worlds are causally isolated from each other.\n\nThis position has become very popular and due to Lewis’ own popularity, I have witnessed many people adopt this view and view it as almost untouchable and that the position is the best account on the ontological nature of modality. I was wondering though are their any good or powerful arguments against Lewis’ version of modal realism? Are their any arguments that really challenge this position when it comes to the ontological nature of modality? Thanks.",

Occurrences like genetic disorders, no fault car accidents, trust funds and inheritances, and pianos falling from high-rise apartments are just situations that we find ourselves in - our outcomes in life are how we navigate those situations.\n\nWe should take full responsibility on the individual level when things go bad. We should look at every negative occurrence in the lens of what we, as the individual, could have done to prevent it. Similarly, we should be proud of every accomplishment or achievement we obtain - regardless of the help or support we received along the way. For example, if I'm mugged walking down an alleyway at night, I should blame myself for walking in a dangerous area or not being prepared to protect myself. If I fail in a big project at work because someone under me didn't perform well, I should blame myself for not being proactive to fix this. If I win the lottery, I should congratulate myself for having the idea to play my luck. I realize this is a slippery slope to what some call \"victim blaming\" - that's fine, this is my personal philosophy.\n\nI'm willing to discuss or answer questions - but I'm mainly looking for answers on how to describe this philosophy and any reading recommendations.

Even if universals are merely ideal, presumably they are not completely arbitrary (we group all dogs together under the concept 'dog' in virtue of some set of criteria). But I don't understand how nominalists can explain this. Even if the mind has a natural power to form concepts adequate to empirical reality, what makes them adequate or appropriate? I don't understand how a resemblance nominalist can hold that resemblance is a brute fact, since it seems like something has to ground resemblance (Fido and Lassie resemble each other as 'dogs' in virtue of what? If a quality, it seems like that is either a universal, or subject to the same problem of resemblance, ad infinitum).\n\nI guess my question is, for a nominalist, what makes things suitable for comparison as similar?",

He had no idea what that was, but when I looked into it, it turns out they are huge on it. I started to get the sense that these are a certain kind of r/iamverysmart and r/atheist \"rationalists.\" I look it up further, and the most common theme in reddit threads is \"he brings up big philosophical questions, but arrogantly dismisses centuries of discussion about them.\" It also seems like he's big time into simulation based philosophy, which I'm a bit biased against. \n\nSo my question is twofold: 1. Knowing this dude is somewhat whack, what's the most productive way I can approach his books as someone not that familiar with philosophy? And 2. What might I want to read next to avoid falling into the \"Less Wrong trap\" people on this sub discuss? The way it's written, I imagine I'll overall enjoy it and probably want to explore the ideas further, but I'm kinda inoculated against taking everything this Yudkowsky guy says seriously.",

(see: attachment theory by Bowlby)\n\nFor example, if there were only securely attached persons within a society, would the society possess the necessary capacity for aggression and vi\\*lence to defend against psychopaths and other anti-social people within their society, i.e., gangs, lone-actors, and the ever-present external threats of hostile nations, terrorists, barbarians, roving gangs and warlords etc. \n\nI have found evidence that securely attached people are less aggressive than insecurely attached people, and I felt that myself when I went from insecurely attached to securely attached, and then from securely attached back to insecurely attached. I observed the differences in the 'fight' in me at boxing. It seems like that the more sensitive I am to my own emotions, the more sensitive I am to the emotions of others, which in turn makes me less aggressive because I feel more connected to others and I desire less to strike them in boxing, and this is a problem for me, as I thrive in a combat environment as I have had an extraordinarily difficult and harsh life, and I thoroughly revel in the aggression, adrenaline and fear of hand-to-hand combat - it feels truly comfortable.   \n\n\n2) Psychopaths and other anti social people\n\nWhy? \n\nWell, relating to point #1, psychopaths and violent people keep the population on their toes and aware of threat, and I suspect that psychopaths and narcissists (Andrew Tate, though I do like him) are the force that tells the men in society that they are not good enough, and that they are weak and will be subject to tyranny if they don't stand up, and eventually oppressed by hostile forces external to the society - the gangs of psychopaths in suits who have been so successful that they hold the reigns of a nation's population, resources and its military.   \n\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "Lately I've been a bit skeptical of the concept of rights and deserts. I'm not quite sure where I've picked up this line of thinking from, and I'm not a philosophy major or anything, but my criticism goes along these lines:\n\n1. **Rights and deserts are too passive.**\n\nIf an individual says they have a right to something or that they deserve something, they are not actually acting in such a way as to secure what they want. They are instead relying upon other people or systems to secure these beneficial state of affairs. \n\n**2. Rights and deserts are too arrogant.**\n\nWe are just bits of stuff attached to other bits of stuff floating around in a vacuum. Frankly we should be pleased we haven't exploded yet. To say we deserve anything is self-important. \n\n   **3. Rights seem like a strange/unnatural category.**\n\nThe idea that we are born with certain inalienable rights seems like magical thinking to me. We do not enter into the universe with instructions pre-attached. It's not like we're a coat with a label that tells others how we should be best taken care of. Do not dry clean, ensure that food is provided, etc.\n\n  **4. Our ideas about what we deserve are conceived of through the lens of capitalism**\n\nFrom our early school days, and throughout the rest of our life, we are trapped in this relentless battle to prove that we are valuable: that we have some utility. Our teachers grade us in accordance with our abilities, and almost everything is turned into a competition.  We are then forced out into the big bad world where we have to fight in order to secure privileges or even basic human needs. \n\nI think this has deeply affected our thinking, such that any thought surrounding deserts are conceived of through the lens of capitalism. Now, in bygone eras that might have been different: perhaps a conception of what someone deserved was more closely related to that person's religious piety. I’m not suggesting that this is better than our current system. What I’m suggesting is that we do away with deserts entirely.\n\n**Anyway,**\n\nSo what do we do if we remove rights and deserts? Well, we can still recognise beneficial states of affairs, and we can work towards securing these beneficial states of affairs for ourselves and others. But I'm not sure we should *expect* them or assume that they are in some way *owed* to us. \n\nPlease let me know if my thoughts are horribly misguided in some way! And feel free to downvote my question if you think I deserve it.",

        "author": "SocialActuality",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/z7fctj/what_to_do_with_philosophical_claims_that_cant/",
        "text": "*(A subtitle to this question might be - praxis vs. impracticable truths)*\n\nI’ve been running up against an obstacle in my thinking recently - what to do with philosophical claims that can’t “walk the walk”, I.E. claims which have minimal or no practical relevance, even if the claims are otherwise true. Put differently, I’m referring to claims which are unlikely to have measurable material impact regardless of their truth or the strength of the logic which undergirds the claim.\n\nI’ll use one of my positions as an example - I am an antinatalist. I would claim it is always wrong to procreate due to the harm done to the created. However, the odds of my being able to convince humanity at large to cease procreating entirely are probably infinitesimally small, if not zero. Therefore, while I’m certainly free to express the relevant truth claim (procreation is always wrong), when it comes to praxis I should primarily act to lessen the negative consequences of procreation (through something like advocacy for better healthcare, improved working conditions, etc.) for the created as much as possible as this is a much more effective use of my time and resources given that it is more likely to have a material impact.\n\nIn this way, my philosophical claims still inform my policy positions and therefore serve as something more than intellectual masturbation. This seems reasonable to me. However, I’d like to examine another example before continuing. I think that the claim that moral values are not strictly objective is true. When I say strictly objective, I mean for moral claims to be empirically true there must be something which would prove the presence of mind-independent moral values that could perhaps be examined under a microscope or measured with a machine. If such a thing does not exist, then moral values are not mind-independent. \n\nI use this latter example because I think it’s “stickier”, I.E. more likely to be controversial amongst academics. What I take issue with however is largely the same problem as in the former example - this claim, even if true, is of little to no practical relevance. The odds of getting humanity at large to act in accordance with the claim that moral values aren’t mind-independent (whatever such actions would look like) are probably infinitesimally small. I myself will probably never act in accordance with the claim. Therefore it is, in my estimation, reasonable to meld the empiricism of social science with ethics in order to inform my policy positions. While the philosophical claim might be true in the abstract, I should instead act in accordance with the best available empirical information as it relates to baseline human psychology for the purposes of bettering society.\n\nIt’s difficult to describe what I’m really trying to get at. To put it another way, is there any point in trying to inform my policy positions or my ethics at large with practically untenable philosophical truths? It’s not clear to me why I should be particularly concerned with whatever bullets I must bite to both accept some form of moral anti-realism (or whatever it is I’ve described above) as empirically true, while simultaneously recognizing that as a practical matter this is largely irrelevant and that baseline human psychology probably forms a perfectly adequate basis upon which to build a system of ethics, I.E. do that which makes people’s lives better because that is what most people, myself included, want.\n\nFeel free to ask clarifying questions, this was written as a stream of consciousness so I’m sure it’s not perfect.\n\n(Note that I’m not here to debate the validity of the above claims [such as the antinatalist claim that procreation is wrong] in and of themselves and any attempts to do so - unless absolutely necessary - will be ignored. I am aware my descriptions of the aforementioned claims are inadequate and that the claims themselves are controversial, they’re just there for the sake of the argument.)",

I am primarily interested in metaphysics, but at times it feels like I am adding more to the fire by making that central in my life. I was wondering what academicians deal with on the daily in terms of dissatisfaction arising from the lack of interpretation they have on subjects they deal with. I find myself falling more often in a profound meaninglessness when I read more. Perhaps this is because, like most undergrads and people interested in philosophy, I have read a lot of existentialist philosophers because they are the most accessible and engaging. I guess my question is does it get better when you find yourself more able to understand the world?

For Mules this means that leaves, trees and shoes are all works of art, but numbers are not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis seems to be missing something from my understanding of Heidegger's thought in \"The Origin of the Work of Art\" from my reading I though Heidegger was saying something a bit different and that artwork lays a philosophy or different form of experience onto a thing. I am also thinking that for Heidegger, art is a being or becoming so it's status as a \"thing that things\" seems to focus on the metaphysical status of the sort of thing it is and not the thing it does.\n\nMy first question is: Is Mules reading correct or does it over simplify? Perhaps there is some debate as to how to interpret Heidegger's definition of art. \n\nMy second question: If we go with the above definition, then is digital art not art? If I look at a Van Gough on my computer than that is not art because I am not looking at an individual thing, but I thing that can be accessed from infinite locations. This becomes a problematic when we consider cinema as a challenge to this thesis. A film (shown on 35mm or 70mm) would be considered an artwork because each copy of the film uniquely \"things.\" Streaming the same movie off of Hulu would then not be a work of art because it is not an individual thing that things. If we are to go to a theater, however and watch a digital version of a film we would be watching a single DCP copy of the film played off of a hard drive. In this case the film has then it seems becomes a work of art since the file is an individual thing thinging to the viewers in the theater. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis definition of art seems to fall apart and become arbitrary when faced modern technological examples and it seems to me like Mules reading is not capturing what Heidegger is getting at.",

Shouldn’t they be abandoned?\n\nTake the Fallacy of Composition: a truth or attribute of a single unit is applied to the collective whole/set (Oxford Reference)\n\n“Atoms are not alive. Organisms are made up of atoms. Therefore, organisms are not alive”. Common example of fallacy of composition. The conclusion is false because it doesn’t account for emergence in what is considered alive.\n\nOkay, but what about: “Bricks are red. The wall is made up of bricks. Therefore, the wall is red”. This conclusion is observationally correct, yet the exact same composition reasoning was used as before. Or another example: “Each metal link is heavy. The chain is made up of these metal links. Therefore, the chain is heavy”. Again the fallacy of composition is made, yet again this fails to stop the conclusion from being true. Hence, the composition fallacy is worthless at refuting arguments.\n\nSimilar exercises can be shown to refute the utility of other informal fallacies (division, as hominem, etc..). So why are they still being yelled out by amateurs in debates as some sort of triumphant refutation card? If the reasoning itself cannot decisively show an argument is wrong (as I just proved), then you have to get in into particulars/details. But that defeats the whole purpose of calling out a fallacy in the first place, which is to refute the conclusions of an argument.\n\nPreviously others have responded to me by saying that fallacies are not about refuting conclusions, but about distinguishing good versus bad reasoning in establishing the validity of an argument. But this is damage control as far as I can see. Correct conclusions is the metric itself that allows one to try to conceptualize good vs bad.",

The idea of using Male and Man, Female and Woman interchangeably in a plethora of different contexts has been LONG embedded into our society.\n\nAnd also our society is already segregated in many areas by both sex and gender: schools, bathrooms, sports, military service, medicine, etc. Some are by solely on the basis of sex, some can be split by both sex and gender.\n\nI believe that In an advanced society (advanced in regards to common understanding of gender expression and gender normativity), we should have TWO identifiers; One for our SEX and one for our GENDER.\n\nIn this society, we treat SEX (male or female) as a verb, and GENDER (man, woman, and everything else) as a noun.\n\n\\&gt;SEX EXPLICITLY means that you are either a MALE or FEMALE, which by definition means you are either able to inseminate (male) or create offspring (female).\n\nIf you can't do either or you it's inconclusive to be able to tell, your sex is Non-binary (can't do either) or Intersex (everything in between).\n\nIt's not that non-binary and intersex are additional sexes to Male and Female, but it's just a way of saying you can't do either or it's inconclusive.\n\n\\&gt;GENDER can be MAN or WOMAN and is NOT limited to those labels. Gender is the lifestyle of any identifier said that is created and forged by the thoughts, cultures, beliefs, and societal modes it exists in.\n\nWith that said, the instant a male or a female is unable to have kids or they officially refuse to have kids, they become non-binary, BY DEFINITION. In other words,\n\nIf a Female who Identifies as a woman ties their tubes and they can't give birth anymore, they are, by definition, NOT a female. But they are STILL a woman, since they can\n\nstill present themselves and act in the way that society has deemed women to present themselves and act. They would go from a Female Woman to a Non-binary Woman.\n\nSame for Males.\n\nSo yeah, Male Man, Male Woman, Female Man, Female Woman, Non-binary Man, Non-binary Woman. It may sound redundant and ridiculous in todays society but that is solely because that's how WE CHOOSE to perceive it in today's society. And it's also because it's something new and we haven't done before so new changes will naturally be weird.\n\nSo with that said, The definition of Woman is easy:\n\nA woman is \"A gender that is the accumulation of ideas, expressions, beliefs, and cultures created by a society.”\n\nYou could just stop at “A gender” to be honest.\n\nWhat is a gender in that case? The definition would essentially be “a lifestyle created by humanity attributed to social and cultural differences.”\n\nYou could honestly just stop at “A lifestyle” to be honest.\n\nSo once again, SEX is the process, GENDER is the lifestyle.\n\nPronouns? At first I thought there would be an issues since \"He\" and \"She\" is automatically defined with the context of sex. However, alls it would take is redefining the context of he and she (when broadly regarding humanity) to be in the context of gender solely. \"He\" and \"She\" could still be used for sex when it's explicitly in a scientific\n\nscenario or context.\n\nFor example, A Male Woman would be referred to as as a \"she,\" a Female Man would be referred to as a \"he,\" and any other gender would be referred to as a \"they\"\n\nBut if I were talking about a Male Iguana, I would simply refer to it as a he.\n\nThe reason why Male Iguana's don't have an extra identifier is because they don't possess the awareness to have a cultural society that informs itself of it's own expectations. Humans are special in that regard, and that is why they would need an extra identifier, especially if scientists claim that the neurochemistry in our minds that is present when we identify our gender is important enough to PRECEDE our sex, and if we want to be inclusionary to all those people.\n\nWhile it may be true that there is certain biological characteristics such as height, weight, shoulder length, curvature or stockiness that are TYPICALLY present with males and females, and people in today's society would often normally base their assessment of those characteristics if someone is a man or woman or not, I must say that that is SOLELY because of the loose way we interchange man, male, woman, and female. Biological characteristics associated with males such as muscle mass, broad shoulders, hairiness, height, etc., are NOT limited to MEN, and same for biological characterizes of associated with females such as body curvature, narrow shoulders, shorter height, etc. NOT being limited to WOMEN. The only reason why we associate these things together is because our current society ALLOWS so and CONTINUES to do so.\n\nIn an advanced society, these characteristics would simply be descriptors of a human being, and that's that. Whatever sexual preference anyone has is up to their sexual preference.\n\nFor instance, you shouldn't expect a Male Man to be obligated to sexually prefer a hairy tall Male Woman, the same way you how in todays society you shouldn't expect a gay male to be obligated to sexually prefer a hairy tall gay male. Its just preference.\n\nIn an advanced perfect society, people would already be used to both of these identifiers in everyday speech and writing when referring to humans and people would treat others with respect without there being controversy nor confusion about what's going on.",

        "text": "Explanation on what i need:\n\nSo let me start by saying that i’m taking a humanities class right now, and the professor plays a game with every class. If you can figure out the game, you get to walk out with an A and never come back to class. I don’t really care about the grade part, but i’m so close to finishing this game. I will explain to you how much i have already, and what i’m missing to complete the game. \n\n\nbackground info :\n\nLet me begin by saying that today, we spoke for an hour in front of the entire class about the game. he said that i figured it all out, except for the summary of it all. he said i must be able to sum it up into one word. i don’t know what that word is, but i’ll tell you what my explanation was that got me so close. \n\n\nmy explanation: \n\ni started by referencing a game he plays with us, where when students ask him “who’s number one?” he says “you are number X”. X being a different number for each student. I realized that if we were to place a comma in there, the meaning would be that i am number 1. we all are. now what does number one mean? it means that you are your own imprisoner and your own liberator. no one could beat you in your head but you. \n\nthe next thing i talked about was another game he plays where he has the days of each class as something that we thought was random, because it didn’t associate with the number of actual days we were in the class. turns out this number was the fibonacci sequence. “God’s signature” or “the golden ratio”. where everything in nature shows evidence of this fibonacci sequence. \n\nthe next thing i talked about is how all these myths we read up on are just truth, given to us in a form of an allusion. he agrees, and examples are like gilgamesh. one of the lessons in gilgamesh is that death is inevitable so just accept it. another example would be enkidu telling gilgamesh that life is easier with 2 people. \n\nanother thing we talked about is ring composition. in the beginning of class, on day 1, he wrote “this is the end” on the board. ring composition is a big part of historical art and it’s suppose to be some sort of truth to life. we’re just trying to get back to the beginning with how blissful we were as children. \n\nhe talks about how the athens had it well when they had schools that taught how to deal with stress, how to be happy, how to have rhetoric, how to be a good leader and a good follower. and how the current education system failed us because all they’re teaching us is trivial things. \n\nhe also does this thing where he says if instead of “good morning” we say “pop pop” to him before he says it to us, he’ll give us an extra point on the final exam. \n\nhe does this other thing where every single day to class he’ll wear something random. like one day he’ll come with a mario hat, the next day he’ll come with glasses with no lens, the next day he’ll come with a bath robe. and his explanation for that is it’s “nonsense”. it makes no sense yet it means a lot. \n\n\nalso every time you make a guess to what this word could be he says “you’re wrong, keep meditating” almost like what a teacher would do to a student if they tried finding an answer to a koan. and he also says that this saying is the biggest hint ever and it’s right in your face. he also says that he says this word every single day of class yet we don’t know what it is because he wants to prove that it’s always right in front of us but we don’t see it. \n\nanyone have a good guess? my few guesses are happiness, truth, or nonsense.",

Here’s the basic reasoning: we as humans treat positive and negative emotions very differently - we perceive negative things as much more negative than they are and positive, often, as less positive than they are. This is something a very well known concept in psychology. So, in order for your life to be “good” in the most basic sense - it has to be more positive than negative, but how can that be if negative emotions are so much worse than positive ones. So even if your life is 70/30 positive to negative, which is very generous, you will still feel like it’s pretty damn negative. \n\nThis must’ve been discussed in philosophy.",

However, I still have some difficulty understanding the passage. It seems like Hegel distinguishes between something just existing (e.g. contingent existence or possible existence) and something being actual. Would this maybe overlap with his distinction between sth being-in-itself and being-for-itself? Is all actuality being-for-itself? Or am I understanding it completely in the wrong way?",
