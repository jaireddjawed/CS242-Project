Assisted collection, as stated on their website, means the bin men are supposed to come into my yard, collect my bins, and then return them to my yard, or right outside at the very least. I have mobility challenges, so I struggle getting the bin down the steps to my yard while walking with my stick, and back up again. \n\nToday, on a very wet and slippery day, the bin men decided to leave my bin at the end of the back street!! So now I've got a swollen elbow, knee and a massive graze down my arm because I slipped while struggling to get my bin back to my yard, and it's not the first time it's happened either! This is my third time complaining to them about them not doing the Assisted collection properly, cause the fall I took today would have caused broken bones in someone more frail or elderly. Why is it so hard to actually do their jobs properly? They knew it was Assisted collection as they came and got my bin from my yard, but didn't feel it was suitable to finish the job properly. I have a sticker on my bin saying \"Assisted collection\" on it as well, so its not like they couldn't have figured it out, and my bin was the only bin left at the end of the street, everyone else's was put back outside their yard",

I barely had my heating on.\n\nI'm temporarily living in a \"C\" rated one, which is constantly cold. I can turn the heating up all the way and after an hour of radiators blaring it's up from 10c to 17c, so I turn them off. Within half an hour the house is 10c again. The heat has gone.\n\nI'm looking for a new house to buy and it's all over the place. F rated houses with the heating off are warm, B rated houses with the heating on are cold and vica versa.\n\nI've started asking friends and family about their EPC ratings. Houses I associate as being warm can easily be an E and houses I associate as being cold can easily be a B.\n\nIt's utterly random!",
