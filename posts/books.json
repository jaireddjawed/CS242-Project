During the month of March, the sub book club will be reading **A Thousand Ships** by Natalie Haynes! Each week, there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, Natalie herself will be joining us for an AMA.\n\nFrom [Goodreads](https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/en\/book\/show\/53487148) (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):\n\n>This was never the story of one woman, or two. It was the story of them all . . .  \n>  \n>In the middle of the night, a woman wakes to find her beloved city engulfed in flames. Ten seemingly endless years of conflict between the Greeks and the Trojans are over. Troy has fallen.  \n>  \n>From the Trojan women whose fates now lie in the hands of the Greeks, to the Amazon princess who fought Achilles on their behalf, to Penelope awaiting the return of Odysseus, to the three goddesses whose feud started it all, these are the stories of the women whose lives, loves, and rivalries were forever altered by this long and tragic war.  \n>  \n>A woman\u2019s epic, powerfully imbued with new life, A Thousand Ships puts the women, girls and goddesses at the center of the Western world\u2019s great tale ever told. \n\nYou may find the dates of, and links to, the discussion threads below in the sticky comment on this post.

At every turn the hero interacts with people who miraculously grant him new opportunities, for whom he always seeks a rational explanation. Yet they almost always are implied to be gods, ancient figures, and wizards of the age working on him.\n\nb) The Aztec and Journeyer novels really disparage people outside the Empire or Italy. These people are backwards and crazy, their religions are laughable, most of their food is unusual or gross, and they contribute little in the way of wisdom. Until he falls in love with a foreign girl, and suddenly they're pretty interesting folks. But he's still taking her away from her backwards culture and into civilization.\n\nc) Just what is this guy's obsession with graphic sex? Did he want to write illicit porn? Why are his characters so damn horny or constantly put in the way of horny things? Every novel he seeks to shock you with some lewd act as quickly as possible, and progress to even more acts throughout the book. All kinds of consensual and non-consensual sex, of all ages, legal and not, on the down low or for public titillation. Same-sex is generally vilified, unless one man has been castrated or it's between two women, even when it's non-consensual. The opening of Raptor has the hero discover their unique characteristic just how you'd expect of Jennings.

Certainly the blurb rates itself very highly:\n\n> \"I think that William Burroughs is the only living American novelist who may conceivably be possessed by genius.\" -- Norman Mailer\n\nI picked up a second hand copy for a dollar or two, and I finally got around to reading it.  Honestly, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to have gotten from it.  Supposedly it is an insight into the mind of drug addiction.  Certainly it is a spiraling surreal, hallucinogenic journey through... I'm not sure what.\n\nThe work begins in the first person, and we follow Burroughs himself through various \"highs and lows\", as he indirectly and fancifully describes his druggie friends and his dealers.  But the story quickly leaps further into the extreme, and a mix of wild and only loosely related scenes follow.  The narrative jumps between places, persons, and tones.  Burroughs himself is left far behind through the middle section, as stream-of-consciousness scenes are played out.  Nearly all involve drugs, death, and a great deal of sex... mostly homosexual, mostly violent, sometimes fatal.\n\nIt wasn't an easy read at all.  The only things that kept me going are the \"I've started so I'll finish!\" and the \"It's a world-famous classic, there must be a purpose to it all!\"  But it was a grind, I can assure you.  And at the end, I really don't feel as though I've learned anything authentic or reliable about drug addiction.  Nor have I gained any new perspective on society.  Or on sexual politics.  Nor... anything really.\n\nThe weird thing is, Burroughs is actually a fantastic writer.  His prose is evocative, rich, clever, and frequently hilarious.  He is clearly a smart and worldly-wise man.  Individually speaking, many of the chapters would have been superb as short stories in a 1960's Playboy magazine, or an 1960's or 1970's sci-fi anthology magazine like \"Galaxy\".\n\nBut the whole is much less than the sum of its parts.  Nothing actually goes anywhere.  There is no character development.  No plot.  No lesson to be learned.  No arc.  The most offensive chapters are overly-long.  The most interesting chapters are too short -- they work up a theme, present an idea, then end prematurely.\n\nThe final result is little more than a test of the reader's stamina.\n\nI do understand that in the 60's, creative writers were looking for \"new forms of story-telling\".  And with your eyes squinted, this certainly does look \"new\".  But it's not really \"story-telling\", so it kind of fails at the first hurdle in terms of what a novel needs to do.  If you're not educating and not entertaining, then... really, what are you offering?\n\nNo, I cannot recommend this book at all.  In the flush of the psychedelic generation this might have looked like a diamond in the rough.  But history and hindsight must disagree.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678682573.0},{"title":"I am K. O'Neill, creator of graphic novels including The Tea Dragon Society series.

Zuckerman, who\u2019s generally seen as Roth\u2019s stand-in, is very peripheral in the AP trilogy. \n\nBy contrast, the zuckerman trilogy focuses on zuckerman, who I have trouble appreciating \u2014 he\u2019s self-absorbed, stubborn, misogynistic, etc. I (like to think I) have no issue with flawed characters in fiction, and zuckerman is a useful vehicle for Roth to explore issues of aging, sickness, death, celebrity, family ties, and the writing process, and a lot of this material is thoughtful and poignant.\n\nBut zuckerman is such a reactive character, with the exceptions of writing carnosky and his very random plan to become a doctor. He seldom ventures into the world and parasitically feeds off the energy and experiences of others, which he uses as material for his stories.

I finally sat down and read it, and as usual with good books I neglect I kicked myself for putting it off when a thousand other distractions get in the way.\n\nAs a story it continues the unglamorous and lived-in humanity of the JDATE series where subverting traditional heroic narratives is both hilarious and bitterly dramatic. Zoey's cool cyborg  boyfriend Armando gets superpowers to become the Terminator in a one-man assault on the villains, before he's unceremoniously killed by a stray bullet and his death leads to Molech getting his hands on the technology he needs to begin his plan. I *seriously* did not see it coming, and it was super refreshing to have a gritty cyberpunk action story treat the value of human life as cheaply for the protagonists as it does everyone else. \n\nWhat really stuck out to me from the story is that for all of Zoey's teardowns of the upper class' apathy, Molech is right about *her* (and her specifically, since in every other aspect he is scientifically designed to deserve to be shot with a railgun). Zoey inherits a billion dollar fortune, injects kindness and empathy whenever she's faced with the humanity of whoever's in front of her, but for all she says that the rich should do something when the time comes her master plan to save Squattersville is to leave like six guys with guns to protect them. They don't need a saviour, they need a society with rules and checklists that prevents human apathy from letting them fall through the cracks, and Will's speech about Arthur Livingstone feels like it'll ring true for Zoey as well; Arthur had a change of heart and wanted to make the world somehow better, but he only knew how to mete that out in ways that resulted in *himself* being at the steering wheel.\n\nI think it's a common power fantasy to inherit money and be unambiguously philanthropic and a lot of us have the shared consequence of knowing the value of money and thus have dreams for all the good we'd do, but that they're dreams lets us hide from the cold reality that the good we could perform is limited by our own ability to do it, and everything we miss is the endpoint of our own apathy and ignorance.\n\nZoey spends the whole story on the run from superpowered cyborg assassins with millions of people watching a live feed of her own explosive execution, what is she going to do with her fortune when things have cooled off? The second book is already out and the third releases next year, and my guess is that she doesn't quite literally cash in on all her big ideas.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678639309.0},{"title":"Agatha Christie's Witness for the Prosecution: Did Leonard know?","author":"milly_toons","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11pij3s\/agatha_christies_witness_for_the_prosecution_did\/","text":"I just finished reading Agatha Christie's original short story *Witness for the Prosecution*, having only watched the 1957 film many years ago.

It seems insurmountable, even though reading 3,600 pages across 10 novels is something we do without even thinking. It resembles the way that I can power through 6 20-minute episodes of TV but take pause before pressing play on a 2-hour movie. I was first turned on to Knausgaard by his Seasons books, which are collections of short stories with bite-sized musings centered on ordinary objects that are strange but unbearably compelling. Still, why read this 6-volume autobiographical novel about a Norwegian author? I\u2019m not sure I could even name another Scandinavian writer. \n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of the book is that the subject matter is often so mundane, yet manages to be elevated in its lack of profundity. It lures us into a false sense of security, a warm blanket of familiarity, then transitions before our very eyes into an insight on the human condition which, at first, seems impossibly linked to the subject matter 3 pages ago, but is undeniable once consumed. \n\nKnausgaard bares his flesh and soul, airs out every bit of his (and his family\u2019s) dirty laundry, and writes the way people don\u2019t realize they think \u2014 contrasted with the way they present themselves. He tears up social contracts and forces the reader to examine their own inauthenticity. He has no qualms with borrowing the title of his book from one of the most infamous pieces of writing in modern history; in fact he displays it proudly. \n\n*Potential spoilers on the novel\u2019s meaning*\n\nIn my opinion, the central theme of the novel is deceit. At first, I felt as if Knausgaard was speaking directly to me, that he was explaining a phenomenon only the two of us shared. However, the genius of this slowly unfolds as he methodically exposes how self-centered we truly are, how blind we are to our commonalities, that all humans experience these struggles in their personal way but none are exempt. \n\nHitler believed in HIS struggle, that no one else could share it, and therefore elevated himself above others and saw no issue with tearing them down. The greatest trick we play on ourselves is trapping our thoughts within the confines of our own world and failing to grasp the significance, the pain, the joy, and the mundane of those around us.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678638669.0},{"title":"Selection Series","author":"Care-Bear99","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11pjd4f\/selection_series\/","text":"* SPOILER *\n\nI will never read another Kiera Cass book after I finish these.

Had heard about Sinclair Lewis in the past and for some reason confused him with Upton Sinclair. I saw Babbit and my curiosity was piqued and bought it for $2. \n\nAnyway, I want to mention, without getting too much into the weeds, I thought it was a great novel in the literary realism genre about the life of businessmen and American middle class life in the 1920s. Suburbs as described in the book written in the early 20s feel eerily similar to how they are today. The book\u2019s description of the American businessman is not that of the ultra rich billionaire class we know of today, but the small-mid business men that rely on their social circles to keep their place in the hierarchy and to keep the \u201cmachine\u201d overall running. I thought it was a very interesting look into the early 1920s post prohibition (just a reminder prohibition began in 1919) parties held by middle class families in their own homes in their cookie cutter suburban homes in their perfect town. It has a lot of mirrors to today\u2019s life as well. I honestly had no idea people in that age (well, at least the middle class) had access to a lot of the luxuries we enjoy today (mass adoption of cars, electricity, electrical nick nacks that were groundbreaking in those days). Additionally, the description of the class warfare between pro-labor class (blue collar workers and unions) against business owners and freemarket conservative business men bosses and tycoons feels just as relevant today as it isnin the book.\n\nPlot: the book revolves around businessman real estate broker George Babbit. He is the archetypical businessman that lives for building him middle class dream home and family. He is successful by the metrics of his home, his family, his car, and his social connections. His deeply buried intentions however reveal that he is a man trapped by this American way of life. He is trapped in his society. He is trapped by his church. He is trapped by his social clubs. He is trapped by his marriage. He is trapped by his kids. As the story progresses he gets away from each of those aspects as dealt in separate chapters but realizes that in his attempts to distance himself from these social chains, he puts himself in great peril. After distancing himself (in various self destructive ways), he finds that he cannot break from who he is or he will surely perish. He wants so badly to be someone else but is cursed in that he can be nobody BUT Babbit. He learns this cruel lesson at the end of the book when he re-enters all of the forms of social life he tried to escape. He has one final saving grace at the end which I will not spoil. \n\nI think this book was more likely groundbreaking and ahead of its time during its release, but I can definitely see the themes of its thesis everywhere so much in our culture today that it is not even surprising in the least. The book is not surprising or mind blowing, but only because it is a very apt description of what we already see every day in the USA.\n\nI think this book is a good look at 1920s life. Not nearly as alien as I imagined. A great period piece compared with the Great Gatsby. I think Sinclair Lewis is actually a good writer and for a book with this topic, I was pretty engaged. I just purchased his book It Can\u2019t Happen Here and can\u2019t wait to read it.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678577655.0},{"title":"JK Rowling\u2019s abusive ex-husband claims he helped write \u2018Harry Potter\u2019","author":"Ok_Copy5217","url":"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2023\/02\/27\/jk-rowlings-abusive-ex-husband-claims-he-helped-write-harry-potter\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.45,"created_utc":1678672844.0},{"title":"Does anybody check books out at the library anymore?","author":"bnreele","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11nvkqg\/does_anybody_check_books_out_at_the_library\/","text":"For both my daughter and son, I take them to programs available at the library in my town.

It gets you to know the author's opinion. But that is only when you KNOW that the author is being biased. Take the example of Rubicon by Tom Holland (I mean when Spider-Man writes a book, you gotta read it). Rubicon is about the last years of the Roman Republic, and my man Tom actually despises Cicero (a famous orator in those days). The adjectives he uses when he is describing Cicero are hilarious: insecure, wanna-be-famous, power-hungry, egomaniac, self-indulging, whimpering, provincial (ouch); even though there far more insecure and status-seeking characters in his book.\n\nThis bias is so obvious I can't help but enjoy it, but there are some biases I'm not aware of, and now that I've read his books, I'm probably thinking those biases. His opinion on historical figures (e.g. Julius Caesar and Augustus), his reasoning on why things happen, the way he justifies or condemns the behavior of these politicians, etc. One of his less subtle biases is that he is trying to cherry-pick events to make the Roman people and their values look like that of the US citizens (are you insinuating something, Spider-Man?). \n\n**When the author is biased, the uninformed reader turns biased too.**\n\nI mean how are you going to write a single book about a 100 years of history that will change the fate of Europe forever? The fact that you have to skip discussing many political, socio-economical, and traditions of that time to fit stuff in the book introduces bias. And the uninformed reader gets this undeserved notion that they are now an \"expert\" on Roman Republic history.\n\nI've learned my lesson. As much as I enjoy the prose and style of these writers, I will not read any such books unless I'm well informed on their subjects. I need my facts and history straight. I can brush off biases in a novel, but not in these books. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think about these genre of books?

These were the years when espionage thrillers that span the globe in their story coverage were the norm in books and movies. I am not talking about the James Bond type of spy novels. Nor the Le Carre with his slow almost sluggish British sense of importance. Forsyth's style was a mix of real world events and fictional characters that made  the readers question if the characters are in fact real life people.\n\nI remember picking up a paperback copy in a bookstore on its discounted table. It was with the sickle and SR-71 plane on the cover. I was maybe 12 years old then. I was starting to like books instead of sports. My weekends would be spent in bed reading instead of playing football or basketball. I suck at sports.\n\nI remember the letters were small and it made reading hard. So hard that I think it took me a couple of years to finish the book. Every time I had to reread from the start because I forgot the characters. And there were a lot of characters in that book. A political thriller about the USSR's wheat production. How could you spin a yarn about it and make it interesting? Don't know. But Forsyth pulled it off. There was a sub-plot about Ukraine when it was still part of the USSR. It was I think my first novel where several plots that seem unrelated were pulled together in the end. And like most of Forsyth's early novels, the twist in the end was cleverly revealed in the last few pages.\n\nForsyth may have retired (not sure) or have slowed down in his writing. His last few stories did not have that 70's sophistication in my opinion. Or maybe my tastes in books have changed. I really hope that he continues writing with his style of intertwining real world political events and how ordinary individuals are swooped into the storm.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678531001.0},{"title":"Bawling through the last chapter in The Catcher in the Rye","author":"eddycrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11odeox\/bawling_through_the_last_chapter_in_the_catcher\/","text":"I had a very weird experience while reading the last chapter in the book.

Even if humans were being kept as meat, how would all of society all at once throw all concern about about animal welfare out the window?\n\nThese events aren't happening hundreds of years after The Transition; they're happening fairly soon after and it's very hard to believe that everyone instantly flipped a switch and adopted this attitude that heads are disgusting, etc. Again, a feeling most people don't even have about actual livestock.\n\nIt would have made the book a bit more interesting to me if only one country had started this and it caused them to be isolated from the rest of the Global community, like Gilead in The Handmaid's Tale. Countries can't agree with one another on anything, yet they'd all agree that humans are food?\n\nI also didn't appreciate the twist ending, which just felt contrived and forced to me. \n\nThis novel felt like half an idea to me. It could have been good, but so much of it just felt like nonsense.\n\nI started 'The Remains of the Day' by Kazuo Ishiguro immediately after finishing this one and even just on page one the writing was already so much better in that hard-to-articulate way that it was a breath of fresh air.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678468443.0},{"title":"Libraries that have free digital library cards for out of state\/province people?","author":"ninja-blitz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11n99ji\/libraries_that_have_free_digital_library_cards\/","text":"I'm looking to broaden the number of libraries I have linked to my Libby app, specifically for ebooks. \n\nMy local public library is partners with 5 other libraries that I have on there, as well as Broward County  PL (even though I'm not even in the US...they were giving these out for free during covid!).\n\nI'm wondering if anyone knows of other public libraries that don't charge fees for people who live outside their library area to get a card AND that also allow said card to be used for Overdrive\/Libby.\n\nBonus points if they have a good Romance selection!","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678408459.0},{"title":"Just finished \u201cThe Kite Runner\u201d by Khaled Hosseini","author":"Rainbownbutterfly","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11nbjb4\/just_finished_the_kite_runner_by_khaled_hosseini\/","text":"This book was very moving and powerful.

I could say a lot more but to start, I think this book is one of the most important non-Fiction works of the 21st Century and I think everyone with even a passing interest in global politics and world history should read it. I know, for myself, that I wish I had heard of it and read it sooner. For having being written in 2009 and updated in 2014, I think Martin Jacques was broadly correct in his assessment of how the rise of China would profoundly change the rest of the planet.\n\nIt remains to be seen if China will truly surpass the United States but the world of \u2018contested\u2019 modernity that Martin Jacques describes in his book seems to be very much coming to fruition today. \n\nThe concept of the \u2018civilization-state\u2019 and its distinction from the Westphalian Nation-State remains very relevant today and I still read articles in places like Noemamag by people as distinguished as Bruno Macaes or Shashi Tharoor debating its validity. One only has to look at modern India, and see the ongoing debate within the country between its RSS\/BJP government which wants Western technology and science but not the values alongside them and its opposition who feel that India\u2019s founding values of Nehruvian\/Gandhism\/Ambedkarism from 1947 were not imposed upon Indians but authentically chosen by them. \n\nThe book\u2019s greatest strength is how thoroughly Jacques supplements his arguments. Together the bibliography and appendix are ~200 pages or so. This greatly adds to the depth and seriousness of the arguments Jacques is making. \n\nI could say a lot more but mostly I just hope you really consider reading this book even if you disagree with it\u2019s conclusions or find them uncomfortable.","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1678460528.0},{"title":"Harry Crews: An American Tragicomedy","author":"largeheartedboy","url":"https:\/\/www.3ammagazine.com\/3am\/harry-crews-an-american-tragicomedy\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678467732.0},{"title":"10 Women-Led Bookstores Across the U.S.","author":"zsreport","url":"https:\/\/www.thrillist.com\/shopping\/nation\/women-owned-bookstores-america","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678539626.0},{"title":"Just finished One Hundred Years of Solitude and I think...","author":"anotheravailable110","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11nne6c\/just_finished_one_hundred_years_of_solitude_and_i\/","text":"The book contradicts itself by first saying \"Time wasn't passing but was going around in a circle\".\nThen at the end when the last Aureliano js born with a pig's tail you think history is going to repeat itself.

The concept was SO tremendous, but the execution was so bland and excessively cheesy in a way that didn't even make sense. The worst part is Wallace. His character would make a great protagonist to have a redeeming character arc. Still, within the first five chapters, his personality is \"quirky,\" and he already understands everything he needs to learn. I also need clarification on how big Wallace's and Hugo's age gap is supposed to be. Wallace dies of a heart attack, so he has to be over fifty statistically. He mentions that Hugo is in his thirties, yet Wallace doesn't speak like a person his age, let alone an earnest lawyer.\nThe side characters are the highlight. Especially Nelson. The reason I almost cried, in the end, was solely because of him and Apollo. The manager was also pretty cool, but I didn't enjoy how he became the villain at one point.\nOverall, I don't know why this book needed romance. Wallace became compelling overnight because the author needed him to, so we were ruling for the romance to happen.

Of mutual respect between people who don\u2019t merely differ within a country\u2019s political spectrum, but literally come from separate sides of the monolithic Iron Curtain.\n\nIt\u2019s a story about passion.

I also truly enjoyed Assassins\u2019 Apprentice. So if you love these books your opinion is valid. And if you bristles at the mere thought of someone criticizing them, then please stop reading this. \n\nMy intention is not to rile any one up. I\u2019m just trying to make sense of the disconnect I\u2019m having between the jubilant praise I\u2019ve heard for this book and my own experience with it as I near the end. \n\nI guess I should\u2019ve seen some warning signs in Assassin\u2019s\u2019 Apprentice that this series might not be for me.\n\nThere were some things that just didn\u2019t track with how Hobb had established the characters. For example, Fitz, who was trained to observe every tiny detail and has what amounts to a physic connection to animals, cannot identify a Duchess and her dog in the kitchen. And, probably more central to the plot, the proud and close knit Mountain kingdom being like, \u201cHum, someone assassinated our Prince. But it\u2019s inconclusive who the culprit is so we\u2019ll just let it slide.\u201d  \n\nSure, it doesn\u2019t track and Fitz\u2019s maneuverings to uncover a painfully obvious scheme were clumsy at best\u2026 but c\u2019mon\u2026 Fitz gets saved by Nosey \ud83d\ude2d so, much like the mountain Kingdom I was good to let that slide.  \n\nThen we get to Royal Assassin. I thought it also had some really strong moments. But by and large those were outweighed by a meandering narrative and a bevy of head scratching moments.    \n\nFor example, Hobb kept setting up obstacles, going to great lengths to establish their difficulty, then almost instantly solving them through no volition of the driving characters. E.g. Fitz has to figure out a way to get all the guards out of Shrewds\u2019 chamber so they can take Shrewd out of the keep. How does Fitz accomplish this? A ruse, trickery, his assassin skills? Nope. There just aren\u2019t guards there.  There are many similar examples.\n\nCharacters also take actions regularly that don\u2019t really track. Like Hobb establishes that Molly is fiercely independent, wants to open her own chandlery, and doesn\u2019t see a place for her and Fitz in the world. Surely there must be some big shift that takes place to change her mind? Nope. Fitz just climbs through her window, and like two hours later she\u2019s saying she\u2019s his wife.  \n\nBut young people are impetuous right? Well what about Verity, who puts his duty to his King and the six duchies above all else (at the expense of his personal life)? Verity who is powerful in the Skill in orders of magnitude more than the restrictively trained coterie? Verity who is sharing a damn Skill link as Fitz observes Shrewd\u2019s deteriorating condition? Would Verity really have had no idea that two nascent skill users were leeching the life from his king?  \n\nI guess you can chalk it up to being distracted trying to protect the coast from Raiders\u2026and for\u2026other reasons of some sort\u2026when Winter hits and the raids stop.  \n\nBut what about Fitz himself? This meticulously trained assassin who can make a death look like anything from an accident to a slow illness? Fitz who has little adeptness or even interest with a blade? Well, he trains with an axe for like a month and is suddenly this unkillable berserker.   \n\nIn fact, Fitz does so much berserking and so little assassinating, that I think this book should have been called Royal Berserker. Truly.\n\nI made it to the point where Fitz\u2019s huge dilemma of how to get rid of the guards around Shrewd suddenly doesn\u2019t exist. Then Fitz decides to Skill link Shrewd to Verity, an act which he knows will kill Shrewd, in an exposed room with no doors or locks that someone is virtually certain to walk into at any moment.  \n\nThen, after facilitating Shrewd\u2019s final moments (if not the full arc of Shrewds\u2019 death), Fitz decides to forgo all of his assassin training in favor of a clumsy berserker attack on the coterie members that culminates in a massive six duchies royal rumble.  \n\nHow poetic would it have been if Fitz used his assassin skills to produce a slow, painful death for Serene and \u2026 the other one\u2026like the death they inflicted on Shrewd?  \n\nI guess I\u2019m just frustrated. Hobb does so much right with this book. The world building is great. The wonderfully inventive power system of the Skill and the Wit. The mystery and intrigue surrounding the raiders. Nighteyes the wolf being a total Bro.  \n\nBut when it comes down to it this is a series that is framed as one revolving around political intrigue, maneuvering for power, and shadowy plots and dirty deeds to secure that power. And, like Fitz\u2019s final attack on the coterie, these aspects of the book are clumsy and poorly thought out.\n\nLike I\u2019m hard pressed to think of one legitimately clever thing Fitz did in the story. Or Regal for that matter. For the most part they both operate as blunt objects with extremely self centered prospectives, free from any real consequences for their actions (tbf a very accurate description of a lot of teenage boys).\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is I really want to like this series. But ultimately I\u2019m left wondering if it\u2019s just not for me and if I should even finish Royal Assassin. That and what teenage boy did Robin Hobb wrong.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678340196.0},{"title":"Thoughts on A Little Life?","author":"icedoatamericano","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11n1a77\/thoughts_on_a_little_life\/","text":"I just finished A Little Life, and I have mixed feelings:\n\nPositives: As someone who went through child abuse, I think this book did a great job portraying how unresolved childhood trauma can fuck up your life and repeatedly bring you back into bad situations because you don\u2019t feel sure of yourself or like you deserve anything better.

After any piece of media I consume, I usually write a long summary of how I felt about it and then go around and read other threads about that same piece, but for this book, it was either a hit or miss for a lot of people and I don't really know if it was a hit or miss for me (that's a conversation for another day) but the negative comments didn't seem to really resonate with me and I disagreed with them to an extent that I decided to create a thread to address them. (I have many negative comments on this book, my main one being that I felt like I got desensitized to Jude's trauma because it was vv repetitive that the second-half of the book lost its substance) but let's go on.\n\n**Critique**: The idea that the book is unrealistic because of the trauma Jude went through (that after Brother Luke, he went to a camp where people abused him, went on truck rides where people abused him, and then met another person that abused him etc...)\n\n**Response:** I read somewhere (I forgot where) that the reason this happened is because after Brother Luke, Jude sort of became a magnet to these sort of people and to this situation in general and I agreed with it. After Brother Luke, Jude was filled with trauma and was filled with these distinct beliefs of himself and hated himself but conceded that this was who he was and this was who he always was. Adding on, the camp counselors knew what happened to Jude with Luke, so the fact that some of them took advantage of this fact and then him, should not seem unrealistic. And the idea again of the magnet, makes sense. This is who he believes he was, and he doesn't believe that he can ever be a person other than someone who has sex for things, so he naturally attracts or perhaps subconsciously seeks people that conform to this idea of himself. I agree that the Dr. Traylor bit was just like sudden that he would just be kidnapped, but it isn't unrealistic. I mean there are creeps in this world and Dr. Traylor was one of them who found an unaccompanied kid and then chose to bring him with him, gauge out his background, and then, take advantage of him. And it's not like everyone was bad to him, the people who tried to adopt him didn't ever abuse him. It's just that maybe the author put emphasis on these three core, bad parts of his life, to emphasize his trauma. But none of that is unrealistic. He was taught with Luke that this is who he is, and so he chose to accept it as he grew older, which meant he didn't fight this identity of his, so he found himself in more positions with these pedophiles because he accepted it, to an extent. We only think it's unrealistic because we don't believe that who we are is what Jude thought he was, so we wouldn't even be in these situations, but Jude did believe that that was what he was, and so that's why he was in many more scenarios where it conformed with his belief, if that makes sense.\n\n**Critique**: The idea that the book is depressing and that it shows that even if one is unconditionally loved, people who suffer substantial trauma are still better off as dead since they have no hope in this world.\n\n**Response:** First of all, Jude only began seriously contemplating suicide again after Willem's death. And the death of your close friend and your lover is already enough to make one depressed\/borderline suicidal, and compounded with all his trauma, obviously he would be back in a dark place. I agree that this book gives little hope. But I mean, the people who give this critique are the same people who said they thought Jude's self-hatred was repetitive. So isn't the book more saying that those who keep giving into their past and their trauma and refuse to change their mindset about themselves are more doomed, rather than those just with the trauma that Jude had? So isn't it a bit more positive than we think. Jude refused to change his mind about himself despite this unconditional love, so it isn't a generalization to say that all people who suffer trauma will follow his depressing pattern and then end in suicide? People said how this book encouraged suicide and I see that. But I also think that it shows the effects of trauma and how sometimes, suicide seems like the only answer, and that sometimes after everything, it is. Maybe it's not encouraging suicide, but letting us as readers see the side of someone who suicided. What drove them to this?This book built so much empathy between readers and Jude that by the time he killed himself, we understood. Maybe it's telling us to look for warning signs of those who are suicidal or just giving us a glimpse of what is in their mind and understanding it. \n\nI think those were the two main critiques that I disagreed with! I have many of my own critiques and problems with this book :) but those are long-winded and I just finished the book yesterday so I need to process it a bit more.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678319412.0},{"title":"Hyperion series by Simmons - is it good or bad literature?","author":"MateorPitt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11n0end\/hyperion_series_by_simmons_is_it_good_or_bad\/","text":"Only last year have I read the first two Hyperion books.

It exposed deep cognitive dissonances about family and religion and love, etc. One thing we were remarking on as mostly areligious millennial-aged people is that this incident might have played out very differently in our day, even in the early 00's. That is, I think in many regions there would've been a bit more support for Marianne both in her family and the community, and the degree of neurosis in this story was sort of alien to us. The result for me was that, while it was a powerful story about a broken family and a rape victim, the messaging was just preaching to the choir and it felt tiring reading it. I was young in the '90s but my impression is that even people then were pretty hip to consent and they might've felt like I do now when reading this book. If word got out about something like this in my hometown there would've been way more public backlash.

Multiple instances of missing quotation marks when the chapter is starting with dialogue. The prose is just as overwritten as usual. Piper uses 97 words when she could use 5. It comes off just as pretentious and melodramatic as it did in the last book. Everything is so over the top that I constantly rolled my eyes. She misuses words all the time and has ridiculous metaphors that you have to reread 2 or 3 times just to make sense of. Basically, everything is as convoluted as it possible could be. Maybe some of ya\u2019ll like this, but objectively this is not good writing. Sorry, not sorry.   \n\n\n**plot\/characters**  \nSo at the end of book one, Amaris and Gadriel escape from a battle arena on the back of a dragon, HP style and then jump off its back and conveniently land right next to this magic academy. The book ends, and one would assume that the sequel will lead to Amaris going to the academy and learning to hone her magic. If you thought that, then you would be WRONG.   \n\n\nSo we start exactly where we left off with little to no recapping of what happened in the last book. You're expected to remember, but it's hard considering how many unnecessary words are jammed between what little plot is actually in these books. They get taken to the magic school, and everyone thinks Gadriel is a demon, and they want to cage and study him. In some supremely dramatic and ridiculous monologuing, Amaris convinces the masters of the school that he's harmless. Amaris convinces herself Gadriel(now Gad) is her new best friend, but when Gadriel says, 'we fought together in Aubade' in response to being asked ', what does this woman mean to you?' she loses her MIND. She gets so assblasted mad because she thought they were friends, but APPARENTLY NOT. It's pathetic and ridiculous, and like Amaris is so naive and has no idea how the real world works at all. She cannot conceive why Gadriel won't share secrets he was sworn to keep with her even after he explains it could mean his life. Like how is Amaris supposed to be likeable lol?? Because Gadriel said they weren\u2019t friends, and Amaris took that shit personally. Then he blames her for his shredded wings, and as usual, Amaris can\u2019t take responsibility, much like her author counterpart. And this becomes a recurring thing in the book. Amaris stays butthurt nearly 500 pages in all because Gadriel said that she was \u2018someone he fought together with\u2019. Literally the entire book is them hot and cold with one another and it's exhausting. Neither of them are likable at all.   \n\n\nThey look at some books at the academy for two seconds, find zero answers and guess that this tower of magic has everything they need. And conveniently, *it does*. They climb 10,000 steps and find the hall of prophecies from the order of the phoenix (you know, the room full of shelves with glowing blue orbs well, this room also has shelves with glowing blue orbs, but the shelves are spiral-shaped, so it\u2019s not plagiarism, guys.) otherwise known as the hall of orbs, and Amaris realizes the floor is invisible and there's an illusion cast over it. Gadriel goes to step over it, and instead of warning him like a normal person, Amaris screams wordlessly. That's it. Then she starts berating him for not paying attention to his surroundings, even though she should know by now that she can see illusions, but Amaris is too stupid to figure this out. After all, she's been aware of her powers for three years and only just started questioning their limitations and capabilities. She is literally an idiot. Gadriel asks Amaris if he can make the jump. She reads WAY too much into this question and thinks, \"oh my god, Gadriel is putting his LIFE in my HANDS. He TRUSTS me.\" And I'm like...bitch; you're the only one who can see the distance. Are you for real rn? Anyway, he makes the jump, and Amaris cries in relief. Literally cries. Imagine if Indiana Jones cried in relief every time he solved a booby trap puzzle while searching tombs. He would look like an idiot. Amaris has a full-blown panic attack, considers leaving and becoming a seamstress and then jumps, doesn't make it, and almost dies, and then Gadriel saves her. They touch some magical glowing blue balls, get sucked into a pensieve(I mean orb), and see some curses\/blessings where faeries explode into golden dust. They meet the oldest man ever, who happens to show them the exact thing they needed to see, then get tossed from the Tardis Tower. (it\u2019s bigger on the inside)  \n\n\nGadriel gets some conveniently 'manufactured' wings and can now fly again(literally has no lasting ill effects of having his wings literally shredded), and then they realize they've learned everything they needed to know and leave. (WHAT? YOU HAVE LEARNED LITERALLY NOTHING) They try to convince Amaris to stay, and she pretends like she's going to and then leaves at night, but it's the most dramatic thing ever. She tries to write it like it's something worthy of ballads, but there is no good reason why it would be. They didn't even *do* anything there. And that's it. That's all that happens with Amaris' magical boarding school plot, and that's when I realized how much of a waste of time this bullshit book is. You had a whole ass magical boarding school, and you didn't use it at all?? You could've had Amaris attend school, actually learn some things since she is the biggest idiot ever and then solve a whole mystery of how the school is corrupt and experimenting on people with unique magic while also searching for the answers to the curse. But no, Amaris learns about her powers in a different way, and WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT.   \n\n\nThere\u2019s a line I want to point out that I found hilariously ironic, and Piper(and Amaris) should take her own fucking advice. *\u201d Ignorance is no one\u2019s fault, but once you\u2019re made aware of your lack, the choice to remain oblivious is when you become culpable.\u201d* So, if this is true, then why didn\u2019t Amaris take advantage of the magic school so that she could not be ignorant about her abilities? Why does she continue to be ignorant of how she speaks with Gadriel by calling him terms she knows are offensive and racist? If this is true, why wouldn\u2019t Piper fix what people have pointed in her book out as being racist, ableist and plagiarized. Why wouldn\u2019t she do the work so she can not be an ignoramus? Hmmmm...  \n\n\nNow, the way that Amaris chooses to learn to wield her power is she \u2018verbally consents\u2019 to allow Gadriel to help train her. This book has a warning for consensual breathplay, but once again, Piper is full of shit and a liar. Saying, \u201cyes, I would like you to train me to use my magic\u201d, does not equate to \u201cI consent to you strangling me in my sleep.\u201d Yep, you read that right. Gadriel waits until Amaris is deep asleep, stands over her in a position that will ensure she can\u2019t fight him off and strangles her until she explodes with sonic power(much like Ciri's power from the show....god, the plagiarism just will not stop.) And when she gets upset, he berates her for not using their safe word (snowbird). Tell me, how the fuck was she going to use a safe bird when you are cutting off her airway? How is she going to speak, let alone breathe? He says that he\u2019s doing what any general would do for his troops, but in what fucking universe does a general strangle their troops in their sleep? This is not consensual breathplay, Piper, and if you think it is, then you need to reevaluate yourself and look up the definition of the word consent.   \n\n\nNow on to Nox. Nox has been honestly just as irrelevant in this book as she was in the last book. She\u2019s hanging out with Malik and Ash and has become a sudden Yes Man, and after literally a week hanging out with them, she decides she loves Malik. Are you fucking kidding me? This honestly makes me mad because Nox was coded as a lesbian. I don\u2019t give a fuck if Piper says she\u2019s bisexual. She wrote about her being repulsed by men, preferring women\u2019s company. She literally says she doesn\u2019t like men and prefers women, but because Piper really wanted to write some hetero smut, she forced her to be bisexual? Stupid af. Not to mention her obsession with Amaris. Has she suddenly forgotten about that all because one guy was nice to her? That\u2019s pathetic. Stand your fuckin ground, Nox. Having her fall for Malik in this is a bad call because it nullifies the fact that she fought her way free from having to fuck men against her will just to get to the woman she loves, only to immediately fall for a guy for literally no reason. Malik doesn\u2019t do anything to deserve being called \u2018pure\u2019 because he is literally no better than a sexy lamp at this point. If she had taken the time to actually cultivate a relationship here where Nox slowly learns to trust Malik, that would be a completely different story. But Piper was too eager to jump in and write smut.   \n\n\nI also think it\u2019s a strange choice to make your \u2018dark fae\u2019(which, according to Gadriel, is a racist term that has been used very freely throughout the entire book) have their powers associated with \u2018nightlife\u2019 and then make them all dubious POC. She even made their country's flag \u2018bronze for the skin of its people\u2019. That is a supremely weird thing to do. Nox literally says she is good at being sneaky because of her dark fae blood, which is also what makes her \u2018bronze\u2019. Gadriel, who is also dubiously brown, is good at picking locks. Like\u2026Piper\u2026.what the fuck are you doing???? Stop being RACIST!!!???  \n\n\nEverything that happens in this book is pure convenience. Nox and Amaris constantly stumble upon the answers. There is no motivation; there is no urgency. Nox dallies most of the time at the Duke of Henares' house, eating a malum malus she got from the tree of life(which is called Yggdrasil because Piper can't make up original concepts, apparently, and has to steal from everything else). She sees the tree\u2019s memories and watches this princess pray to the All-Mother for protection for her *son*. Then we find out that the priestess, who is only ever referred to as the Tarkhany woman with \u2018onyx skin\u2019, was blessed by the All Mother with immaculate conception and guess who the baby was? You guessed it. Amaris. The super white snowflake was immaculately conceived by a woman with very dark skin(because Piper has a really weird obsession with the contrast of dark and light skin, I guess). This is what they say to the nameless priestess(who actually dies earlier in this book in a very throwaway scene) when she asks if she gets to raise the child she just birthed. *\u201dThe child belongs to everyone and no one, beloved\u2026.This babe is the manifestation o the prayers of the faithful.\u201d* So not only is Amaris literally the purest PERFECT SNOWFLAKE ON EARTH BECAUSE SHE IS A MANIFESTATION OF A PRAYER(in other words, Jesus), but a nameless black woman was used and killed off for no other purpose than to be her vessel.   \n\n\nWe later discover that Nox's pen pal from the Chamber of Secrets, aka Tom Riddle, was actually the Gray Matron all along! She gets Nox to travel *all* the way back to the orphanage and tells her the truth(even though she had a literal magic quill she could've used to save everyone some time). Ya'll are gonna love this. Turns out that Princess Daphne, Queen Moirai's daughter, had a child with King Ceres from Raascot(the dark fae king dude). Daphne was apparently already married, and so to hide her child from this nameless husband, she goes to this CHILD MILL, leaves her daughter there and asks for a baby(specifically a boy) with similar coloring to her baby's. Then she leaves Nox there with the Grey Matron and brings the boy back with her and the boy immediately gets murdered because the nameless husband knows it's not his. This has left me with so many questions.  \n\n\na) how did the orphanage\/child mill have a baby of Nox's exact coloring when in TNAIM, we're told that Nox is a novelty and people of her complexion are never sold at the orphanage? She is literally put on display as a trophy *because*of her skin tone. So how did they manage to have a baby to exchange conveniently? (also, wow, way to callously kill some nameless child, Piper.)   \nb) how did no one realize Daphne had a baby girl? were there no midwives when she gave birth? this is medieval times; I highly doubt she gave birth alone because there's a huge chance of her dying. So how is it not a single soul outside of the nameless priestess and Agnes knew that Daphne actually had a girl? When Daphne went to the temple to pray for help, she asks for help specifically for her *son*. Why would she ask for help for a son she does not have? I know Piper was trying to trick us or whatever, but...that's just bad writing? Do you think the All-Mother is gonna realize you're actually talking about your hidden daughter, Daphne?   \nc)why, if Agnes never intended for Nox to be sold, did she allow Millicent to take her to the brothel? She says she didn't know how to deny her without spilling the beans, so she just....lets Nox be taken? In what world does that make sense? If she's supposed to protect Nox why did she let Nox think it was Amaris who needed to be protected? Why would she allow Nox to put herself in harm's way to protect Amaris? Why would she allow Nox to be whipped? Why would they constantly talk about Amaris being perfect and unmarred if it was truly Nox who was the important one and they knew it all along? None of this makes sense.   \n\n\nNox was named Nox, so she wouldn't forget the north. Fucking kill me. Well, she clearly knew nothing about it, so.   \n\n\nAmaris tells Gadriel that she got turned on when he choked her nonconsensually, so then he chokes her consensually(even though she freaked out when he choked her and this could easily trigger her into another panic attack, but okay.). She blows him, and he finger bangs her while choking her but won't take her virginity because it should be gentler the first time. First of all, you cannot tell me that Amaris still has her 'maidenhood' when she's been riding horses all this time. Piper doesn't know shit about horseback riding, though, and that's obvious. Second of all, I am convinced Piper has a secret incest kink. Why do you ask?   \n\n\nWell, Nox and Amaris were written as sisters, but now they're apparently star-crossed lovers? (yet they're boning random men along their journey to find one another. Makes sense.) Nox and Amaris are actually 100% based on Yennefer and Ciri from the Witcher, which is a mother\/daughter relationship(Piper can say this book has nothing to do with the Witcher all she likes, she literally dedicated to this book to Henry Cavill as Geralt. We're not idiots.). Amaris calls her fellow reevers her 'brothers' and then tries to fuck one of them. And now she has a daddy kink with Gadriel(proven by the fact that Piper continuously calls him Dadriel.)   \n\n\nDon\u2019t give your money to Piper CJ.   \n\n\ncurrently reading  \n\n\nThis is what happens when you write a book in 9 days and don\u2019t accept constructive criticism. You get sentences like this.   \n\n\n\u201cShe knew she was about to watch the head of a man as it was gnawed from where it connected to his shoulders.\u201d  \n\n\nThe whole book is like this. How did this pass the beta reading process?? This is not ready for publication.   \n\n\npre-review  \n\n\nya'll remember that time that Piper said that TNAIM wasn't even inspired by the witcher and then she went ahead and dedicated this book to Henry Cavill as Geralt? Yeah, me too.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678281588.0},{"title":"I need some guidance with iambic pentameter written poems","author":"Intelligent_Head_214","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11lpbko\/i_need_some_guidance_with_iambic_pentameter\/","text":"I\u2019ve researched the concept: 10 syllables, 5 feet, and two syllables coupled in a de-dum rhythm. \n\nGot it\u2026in theory.

The finger-bowl incident, her account about the gentleman who eats salad with his fingers, tears \u201cflying\u201d out her eyes, her description of Lenny\u2019s short friend, Esther\u2019s mischievous chemistry class contrivance leading the professors to appreciate her \u201cintellectual maturity\u201d.

If there was a way the book could\u2019ve had a tragic turn, then it was Betsy who should have been found hanging on the tree not Joan.

It's definitely positive and uplifting. If you want something encouraging to read, I recommend it.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a story with magic, I'd look elsewhere. Maybe it's just me, but when I think of alchemy, I picture drinking potions to turn invisible to hurling a vial at someone to set them on fire. When the main character finally gets his big chance to cast a spell (turning into the wind), he asks the sand, wind, and sun for help. Now I've read a few books on witchcraft, and none of the spells have in their instructions, 'Ask the wind.' The worst part? When he finally succeeds, it happens virtually off-screen, with another character making an off-hand comment about it. If you're doing all that build-up, at least show the character succeeding, describe him feeling like his body is lifting up into the sky, he can't feel his fingers, or something like that. Don't write several pages of his searching for the means to cast the spell and then just have someone say, \"He turned into the wind. It was amazing! you should've seen it!\"\n\nOnce again, my views on this book are based mostly on my expectations, hoping for a fun fantasy adventure. And again, I recommend this book as a well-written spiritual journey that makes the reader feel better afterwards.

She was an ambitious and stern moralist. She was acutely conscience of human failings and wanted, through her novels, to make people less selfish and more reasonable. More dignified, and sensitive to the needs of others. \n\nJane Austen was born in 1775 to an Anglican clergyman and his wife; Jane was the second youngest of eight children. And her father farmed and took in students to make ends meet. Jane was mostly taught at home and sometimes she wasn\u2019t taught at all, although she and her sister did go to a year or two of boarding school. When she was eleven, Jane started writing plays and novels, mostly social satires and parodies of \u201cnovels of sensibility,\u201d a literary genre in which women like, cry, sigh, and faint a lot. \n\nAusten grew up in a small village in Hampshire, where her father was the Anglican rector. They had high social status but were not well off. She lived in the social circles found in her novels. Jane's parents supported her education and provided space for her to write and publish her work anonymously. But writing was hardly lucrative work. \n\nElements of her circumstances can be found in many of her characters; often intelligent women with witty, pragmatic personalities, and rich inner lives. She did much of her writing at a tiny octagonal table. Many of these early works were in the style of the epistolary novel, which is a story composed of letters. We also see some echoes of this in Austen\u2019s life. And although she had sparks of chemistry, she never married, on a couple of occasions, she was tempted. \n\nAnd after her father\u2019s death in 1805, her financial position and the positions of her mother and her sister became increasingly insecure. By 1816, four of her books had been published. And she was working on a new novel, called Sanditon, when she died in 1817, at the age of just 41. Two more of her works, Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, were published after her death. Her novel feels like every single word in it is genuinely essential. \n\nHer dry wit and cheeky playfulness inform her heroines, whose conversational tone welcomes readers with a conspiratorial wink. It\u2019s even been said that some readers feel like the author\u2019s secret confidante, trading letters with their delightfully wicked friend Jane. Her writings contained sly satires of society, civility, and sweeping romance. Written in the early nineteenth century, Austen's novels decode the sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England.\n\nFrom resentment couched in pleasantries to arguing that masks attraction, her work explores the bewildering collision of emotions and etiquette. But while romance is a common thread in her work, Austen dismissed the sentimental style of writing so popular at the time. \n\nInstead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally, and often awkwardly. They trade pragmatic advice, friendly jokes, and not-so-friendly barbs about their arrogant peers. As they grapple with the endless rules of their society, Austen\u2019s characters can usually find humor in all the hypocrisy, propriety, and small talk. \n\nAs Mr. Bennet jokes to his favorite daughter, \u201cFor what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?\u201d And though her heroines might ridicule senseless social mores, Austen fully understood the practical importance of maintaining appearances. At the time she was writing, a wealthy marriage was a financial necessity for most young women, and she often explores the tension between the mythical quest for love and the economic benefits of making a match. \n\nThe savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums this up in \"Mansfield Park;\" \u201cI would have everybody marry if they can do it properly: I do not like to have people throw themselves away.\u201d \n\nUnsurprisingly, these themes were also present in Austen\u2019s personal life. These headstrong heroines provide an entertaining anchor for their tumultuous romantic narratives. \n\nLike the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet of \"Pride and Prejudice,\" whose devotion to her sisters\u2019 love lives blinds her to a clumsy suitor. \n\nOr the iron-willed Anne Elliot of \"Persuasion,\" who chooses to remain unmarried after the disappearance of her first love. \n\nAnd Elinor Dashwood fiercely protects her family at the cost of her desires in \"Sense and Sensibility.\" \n\nThese women all encounter difficult choices about romantic, filial, and financial stability, and they resolve them without sacrificing their values\u2013 or their sense of humor. Of course, these characters are far from perfect. They often think they have all the answers. \n\nAnd by telling the story from their perspective, Austen tricks the viewer into believing their heroine knows best\u2013 only to pull the rug out from under the protagonist and the reader. \n\nIn \"Emma,\" the titular character feels surrounded by dull neighbors, and friends who can\u2019t hope to match her wit. As her guests prattle on and on about nothing, the reader begins to agree\u2013 Emma is the only exciting character in this quiet neighborhood. Yet despite her swelling ego, Emma may not be as in control as she thinks \u2013 in life or love. \n\nAnd Austen\u2019s intimate use of perspective makes these revelations doubly surprising, blindsiding both Emma and her audience. But rather than diminishing her host of heroines, these flaws only confirm \u201cthe inconsistency of all human characters.\u201d \n\nShe doesn't tell us why her sense of priorities is important, instead, she shows us a story that will also make us laugh, which can grip us enough that we want to finish supper early to read on. Upon finishing one of the novels, we're invited to go back into the world and respond to others as she has taught us. \n\nTo pick up on, and recoil from greed, arrogance, and pride, and to be drawn to the goodness within ourselves and others. Sadly, the moral ambition of these novels has largely disappeared in the modern world, yet it's the best thing that any novel can do. \n\nThe satisfaction we feel when reading Jane Austen is really because she wants the world to be a certain way and we find that immensely appealing.\n\nTheir complexity has kept Austen prominent on stage and screen, and made her work easily adaptable for modern sensibilities, and hopes they continue to do so. It's the secret, the largely unrecognized reason why she is such a loved writer.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678207750.0},{"title":"Do any of you know how to speed up the aging process of books?","author":"_L0c0m0tive_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11mnfti\/do_any_of_you_know_how_to_speed_up_the_aging\/","text":" I prefer my books to be older and worn so I am really hoping to quicken the process of aiding in the wearing of it.

Adler made a list for the Western World, but instead of the western and orthodox civilizations, I want one which is centered around the Islamic civilization. I don't think it is possible right now to make a list as big as his but 50 books will be more than enough. This can help us find a coherent tradition and corpus of academic, non fiction and fictional literature, which will help us non Muslims and outsiders to get a grasp of the Islamic civilization but also help Muslims understand their world, civilization and intellectual tradition.

But I want them to focus on civilizations for now.\n\nSome books I think are essential to add to the list. Obviously 2 of them would be the Qur'an, and the Hadithic Canon( mostly Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). These serve as the literal and literary foundation for the Islamic civilization. Other than that I would definitely include Al-Muqaddimah by Ibn khaldun, The Epistle(Al-Risala) by Imam Al Shafi'i and the Meccan Revelations by Ibn Arabi. Obvious some books by Al Ghazali would have to be included such as Revival of the Religious Science, Alchemy of Happiness or Deliverance from Error, haven't read any of his source books mostly read about him so I can't be for sure. Others such as Ibn Sina's Al Shifa or some other of his books. Rumi's Mathmawi and of course some other literary books such as Antarah Ibn Shaddad or the famous 7 hanging odes. Some perhaps by Muhammad Iqbal as well might be useful, though it might stand short of the criteria, since I don't if it effected Islamic civilization as a whole or Muslims from other parts of the world. Some texts from the Shiis and the Ibadis should also be included since they also to am extent had an impact on the whole of the civilization. Far eastern, middle eastern, African, south Asian and the various diasporas of Muslims all around the world, any text deemed worthy should be included.\n\nThe criteria as far as I can think should be that the text is something that deepens your insight and understanding of the world while at the same time had an immense impact on Islamic civilization in general, or at least in some of it's major parts.

Some chapters (16) feel uneeded and uncomfortable in the wrong way for horror literature. \n\nThe biggest shame for me is that there are some really good pages in here, that have interesting ideas, but they're glossed over in favour of a pretty weak central narrative. When we get a peek at the splinters of the main group, that's when I'm most invested.\n\nThere's also a lot of instances where characters will be named and given some detail right before they die - in one instance, a character is first named *as they're dying*.\n\nHas anyone else read this book? I'd love to hear your thoughts on it, because I'm so conflicted on this book after finishing it.","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1678094605.0},{"title":"The coming of the death stench: Junji Ito's \"Gyo\".","author":"i-the-muso-1968","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11jm0m2\/the_coming_of_the_death_stench_junji_itos_gyo\/","text":"Finished reading another of Junji Ito's classics \"Gyo\".

Repetition is also somewhat of an occurrence here.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help feeling that he managed the structure of the book better in The Body as here, at times, he jumps around wildly from topic to topic on his way to coherence. In a chapter about the passage, a sort of hallway in this case, he reminisces about the Eiffel Tower, shortly remembers to mention the passage for one paragraph and goes on to expound on concrete, Thomas Edison and finally landing on the telephone (as in his domicile, an old rectory, the phone was located in the passage, thus serving as his thread of connection). After his recount of the history of the telephone he advances to its technical specifications and the personal lives of those around the invention and then quickly remarks on the standards of practice for its use in the past before finally moving on to luxury architecture for the super rich and the architects involved (by this point it feels like we\u2019ve returned to this topic at least twice before in different chapters). Much of this could have been fixed by changing the chapter names to accompany this sort of free form writing.

Well; it is and it isn't.  It's unforgettable, I'm sure.\n\nIt's a fictional story of the life of an army hero who (as a teenager) feels like a \"man of destiny,\" joins the Army to fight in WWI and then stays in the army and goes up and down in the ranks through his career.  Lots of melodrama.  He displays his capacity for quick thinking and leadership in battle.  He meets a bewitching girl, and marries her.  He meets and interacts with an enormous variety of different people.  His leaders betray him, both anonymously and personally.  He betrays others, through no fault of his own (or perhaps, through understandable fault).\n\nI can imagine why it's required reading at West Point, if it really is.  There are two reasons:  first, it seems like a remarkably good view of what those who pass through that institution can expect their careers to look like, if they do well and stay in the Army.  West Point wants to be able to tell them they warned them:  your rank may be reduced through no fault of your own, you won't make a lot of money, your posts may be boring or even awful, and friends may be hard to find.  Second, it considers the deeper issues of war pretty thoroughly.  Is it pointless?  Hell yes.  Is it an amazing waste of (sometimes) very good people?  Hell yes twice.  Will your superior officers betray you, both anonymously and personally, and for their own personal glory or to hide their faults?  Hell yes again.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about it is how leftist much of it is, when it comes to war.  It starts out portraying Our Hero, Sam Damon, as a kind of Soviet Realism hero, a worker of the people, by the people and for the people - and courageous and strong too!  Manliness to burn.  But then it asks all these questions about what war is for, and doesn't answer any of them permanently or finally.  We do the best we can, it concludes (I think), and that's all we can do.\n\nIt didn't occur to me before I'd read it, but isn't the old style of war, the European style, where countries fight over zones of influence and who's going to make the rules about how the people live, really just a battle over who will profit from what is profitable in a country?  If so, then war is really a way of conning the poor into defending what the rich own, disguised as a way of life or national principles.  I'm sure this is not a new idea, but it's new to me.  Well, I'm young lol.\n\nAs I say, an unforgettable book - but I wouldn't call it a real masterpiece.  If those two purposes I listed above are the real reasons it's assigned at West Point, well done - it does the job.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678053811.0},{"title":"The Silver Chair - Legend of Tannh\u00e4user","author":"decrementsf","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11j6tme\/the_silver_chair_legend_of_tannh\u00e4user\/","text":"Recently came across a version of Legend of Tannh\u00e4user from a collection of popular tales from the Norse and north German published in 1907. Starting from the skeleton of this story and draping the world of Chronicles of Narnia over it would explain what we get in The Silver Chair. Included is the ideas of enchantment and temptation of the green witch and her underground kingdom.\n\nAnyone pick up on this connection before? Are there other stories you have found that inspired larger narrative elements within Chronicles of Narnia books? Curiously, I do not see much reference to this interplay between The Silver Chair and Legend of Tannh\u00e4user discussed elsewhere.\n\nIn the Legend of Tannh\u00e4user the travels of a knight lead to invitation to competition at the court of Dame Venus. Who it is revealed lives in an underworld caverns below a mountain. She is described as giving friends the most exquisite pleasures earth can afford, both of silver and gold of abundance. Another is met along the way who claims for 300 years has been employed in warning those away from the temptations of the Venus Mount. He warns to stay away from the mountain lest the temptress entangle thee in her net. The knight travels to the court of Venus anyway. To have a look considering that if it looks amiss he can turn and leave before being ensnared.\n\n> *As the mountain is approached discordant sounds resolve into harmony.* Through a door in the rock they could see knights, beautiful women, and dwarfs. All seemed to be enjoying themselves utmost. At the entrance sat a fair woman in royal robes. The moment she saw Tannh\u00e4user she smiles, and signed to him to approach. Eckhard in the same moment entreated him by all he held sacred to *beware of the temptress, who was outwardly like an angel of light, but inwardly a fiend incarnate.* He would have said more, *but Venus interrupted him by beginning to sing a wondrous song about the joys that awaited those who entered her kingdom; and Tannh\u00e4user, as thoroughly enchanted as though a magic spell had been cast over him, thrust Eckhard aside, and hastened to the queen of beauty, who stretched her arms out to him*. She half drew him over the threshold, and he half staggered across. Then the door shut, and the faithful Eckhard saw him no more.\n\nThe main point of the legend describes how every day brought new pleasures, which the knight enjoyed to the utmost.\n\n> But at length began to tire of it, and confessed himself that satiety was not happiness. He had a horror of himself, and of the self-indulgent life he was leading; and his conscience, once awake, left him no peace. Rest of the story describes his effort to escape and return to his prior life in which all he had held important was put on hold.\n\nCore elements of The Silver Chair are all there. Adventure to the far north to seek out a mountain with entrance to the underground kingdom. The temptress witch using music and enchantment to ensnare. The witch turning into a snake is a visible depiction of the inward fiend incarnate. Time lost in those depths. The long road traveling back out of the underworld. The most vivid parts of The Silver Chair are those that map closest to Legend of Tannh\u00e4user.\n\nInteresting story to stumble on. Raises questions what other sources in the cauldron of storytelling were used by CS Lewis to craft the larger works.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678041026.0},{"title":"Heather Hansman's pursuit of ski bum dream led to \"Powder Days:\" The author drew on a decade of personal experience and another winter reporting across the West to craft her book on the history and future of skiing","author":"drak0bsidian","url":"https:\/\/coloradosun.com\/2023\/03\/05\/sunlit-heather-hansman-powder-days\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678063383.0},{"title":"Untangling the Wolf: Erica Berry on Fairytales, Fear, and Dismantling Narratives","author":"zsreport","url":"https:\/\/lithub.com\/untangling-the-wolf-erica-berry-on-fairytales-fear-and-dismantling-narratives\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678035391.0},{"title":"les mis\u00e9rables is making me le mis\u00e9rable","author":"RudionRaskolnikov","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11irnm5\/les_mis\u00e9rables_is_making_me_le_mis\u00e9rable\/","text":"So I started this book with high hopes, the plot seemed interesting and I am a fan of that historical period so I started reading.\n\nNow I don't know if this is because of the translation or the writer's original writings but this book is such a chore to read.\n\nI can't maintain my regular reading speed, I have to read every line like a little child does, word by word for some reason.\n\nI am stuck on the first chapter about that priest and it's pretty boring and I can't seem to get past this point since last week.\n\nAnd it's not that I am used to thick books, but this one just seems daunting","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1678004216.0},{"title":"Hybreading?","author":"HAOsDad","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11kf6m0\/hybreading\/","text":"I'm developing a pattern, an approach, or an illicit bad habit of listening to books that I then buy in paperback and hard copy.

But I did \"consume?\" all of George Eliot this way.   \n\nThe Wealth of Nations was perfect for this format.   Smith is brilliant, dryly funny, and encyclopedic.   Unfortunately for the page-bound reader he's among the few people in history entranced by the year by year fluctuations in corn (wheat) prices and currency exchange rates since coinage appeared lo those many centuries ago.   If you're hamstrung by a conviction that skipping ahead isn't good reading manners, you're thrilled to let those prices roll sonorously by as you empty the dishwasher or take out the recycling.  \n\nThis was also great for Michael Wood's Story of China because I could hear the pronunciation of names that would have been irritatingly unknown to me had I only reading them on pages.   And finally, I am the belated, exasperated, \"reader\" of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century, which would have taken me as much of the century to finish in print as providence will allot me (probably a much smaller chunk than if I hadn't picked up the book and downloaded the audio version.)   He writes as though what he's substantively got to say is in a reception line being exhaustively introduced as it shuffles up to the reader.   But it's a long, long line and it so likes the readers attention that it and, loops back around to be reintroduced again, assuming in error, it won't be remembered.  Again and again.   The publisher may have required that produce something as physically imposing as Marx's Das Kapital.   Otherwise, it's fair to say that if he's being haunted by a specter, it's prolixity.  \n\nFinally, it let's me indulge my favorite, but too rarely accommodated love of reading in streaks - 3 books in a row on the Russian Revolution that came after a couple on the French Revolution and one on the American because the commute means no interruptions and no FONDSMoP (Fear of not doing something more productive.)\n\nBut despite all these advantages, is this according to Hoyle or am I debasing myself?","upvote_ratio":0.19,"created_utc":1678139272.0},{"title":"Weekly FAQ Thread March 05, 2023: What book made you fall in love with reading?","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11ivgim\/weekly_faq_thread_march_05_2023_what_book_made\/","text":"Hello readers and welcome to our Weekly FAQ thread!

Years later, I picked it up again and just finished the whole book...wow. It's a spectacular story about two sisters finding agency, spirituality, and love in their lives. I highly recommend listening to the audiobook version, since it's narrated perfectly by Alice Walker herself.\n\nJust as a trigger warning, the book definitely starts at the lowest point, where the main character Celie is sexually assaulted and abused as a teenager (to describe it lightly). This was definitely tough to get through, but the story is ultimately about her self-empowerment, finding agency, and exploring sexuality and love. \n\nThis book is truly ahead of its time. Interwoven beautifully with the narrative are nuanced discussions of:\n- African American family dynamics in the 1900s\n- African tribes and their relationships with Christian missionaries\n- Different levels of misogyny and sexism in both American and African society\n- Spirituality not being same as strictly defined religion\n- The human will to live and survive through trauma\n\nOverall, this book was a transcendant and incredibly healing experience.

I chose Louise Erdrich primarily because she\u2019s such an outstanding writer with gorgeous language and really unique and interesting stories, but she\u2019s also Native American and many of her novels and stories represent this perspective (of course there are many different tribes and many different native perspectives; Erdrich is Chippewa). \n\nToni Morrison\u2019s writing is incredibly rich and vivid, and I love how she captures different times and places in US history in her novels.

The major part of the book deals with the love life and heartbreak of Marianne, the younger sister of Elinor. The sisters have opposite thoughts towards love, which is a debated point in the book.\n\nThe title of the book is fairly justified; the book portrays how common the lack of sense is in society, for the protagonists are shown to be civil and sensible.\n\nOne thing is for sure, Jane Austen very well knows how to display the stupidity of characters through her writings. Of course, her novels are more aptly 'novels of manners' than romance novels so it is expected for the author to be judgemental and sarcastic about characters, but the wit she presents so subtly and unexpectedly is remarkable.\n\nI got bored in the second of the three parts of the book, because I found it to be dwelling too much on the heartbreak of Marianne, but the story gained pace towards the end.\n\nThe book won't disappoint anyone, we get what's expected - romance, wit, sarcasm, intelligence and unintelligence.\n\nOne of the most important thing that I noticed was that never be too harsh to judge anyone in your friend or family circle - we should learn to accept every kind of behaviour. For in the book, Mrs. Jennings seemed to be the least appealing to Marianne, but she's the one who supported her till the end!\n\nSpoiler alert!\n\nAccording to me, one thing that Jane Austen wanted to highlight is the similarity in the characters and contrast in the circumstances of Willoughby and Edward. Edward and Willoughby both didn't speak clearly to their respective lovers, and hence the latter were left to assume their relationship by themselves. But in the end Edward's situation turned out to be beneficial for Elinor, whereas Willoughby due to his greed, hurt Marianne. I wonder what Edward would have done if Lucy didn't undergo a transfer of affections.\n\nAlso as in the initial part, Marianne thought of herself as well as seemed as the most sensible character in their society, when in fact she turned out to be the most stupid for loving someone like Willoughby so blindly; because I always assumed Willoughby to be a playboy, as perceived from certain descriptions as well as the behaviour portrayed in the book.","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1678019337.0},{"title":"What do your reading notes look like and how do you take notes","author":"Klarkasaurus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11irrn9\/what_do_your_reading_notes_look_like_and_how_do\/","text":"I need to start taking notes because sometimes I just don't have the time to read so I go a fair few days without reading and forget a lot of stuff when I go back to reading. \n\nI need a \"previously on...\" so I thought reading notes would be a good idea but I never know what to put, when to stop reading to take notes.

And so tells me Wikipedia, but it still sounds so improbable:\nThat Genghis Khan was initially a dirt poor nomad half-orphan boy, abandoned by his tribe and starving. His true name was Temujin. And by a sequence of what I call a mixture of miracles and political intelligence (he was a boy still), he gathered warriors and became powerful. And not just some warriors, but (by wit and a lack of ability to forgive), he overthrows initially all tribes in the Mongolian steppe and becomes the Khan of all Mongols.\nAnd he doesn't stop there. At all!\nWell what I want to say: read it and let's discuss :)\n\nEdit: thanks for the historical background knowledge! I was rather asking for \"do you know anything in addition to the told story which explains the seemingly incredible developments, - something which is not shown in the story\". From your answers I take away that\na) the story of the book is indeed what happened and\nb) it is unsure to what extent the \"conquering of the entire world\" by the Khan was a long term planned campaign, vs \"it just happened since he couldn't stop the battling, like in a rage\" (the latter is in accordance with the book)","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677964544.0},{"title":"I just finished Anna Karenina\u2026","author":"SafeHospital","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11hpb1s\/i_just_finished_anna_karenina\/","text":"I haven\u2019t really read anything in years, but at the end of January I read Crime and Punishment and it really got me back into reading.

I\u2019ll start with bitching about what I didn\u2019t like, then go into what I loved. I mildly bitched about Bradbury\u2019s writing style, and have to do so again. \n\nThe last part..his style kills the tension a lot of times. I\u2019ve grown to like it. But it\u2019s not conducive to dread. When I finished I realized I* fucked up. It\u2019s a coming of age story. I was reading it like it\u2019s \u201cthe thing\u201d of movie horror brilliance. Realize when I criticize a lot comes from that. \n\nI expected a existential horror which, the merri go round did! Trapped. The Mr. Cooger part was my favorite. It kinda climaxes midway through the book. What really gets me is Charles character. He goes on these philosophical rants, and I dig, but no one talks like that. I do appreciate him asking the boys about it in the library, the pondering of an old man. \u201cI got like 3% of what you rambled about\u201d or something like that. Reminds me of my pops. \n\nLong story short. The ending sucked IMO. The power of love..I\u2019ve probably read too many stories with that as the end all be all. Mr. Darks death was so..like dumb. He got hugged to death? I understand the idea, I just thought it was..anticlimactic. Same with the smile on the bullet. The idea was good, it just didn\u2019t mesh welll. \n\nThe good: \n\nMr.Dark is legit a great creepy character. I loved how I originally thought this and confirmed later that his tattoos are trapped souls. What a great idea.\n\nThe sense of fear is well done bc \u201cthere\u2019s some people coming after me\u201d and I like how Charles believes them. I love his musings of getting old, even if Bradbury embellishes it a bit much. \n\nMy favorite part is the first merri go round. It\u2019s fucking amazing. \n\nI like the little twist at the end, though I saw it coming miles away. I also thought it was a cool metaphor about \u201ccheap tricks\u201d. Like when Charles talks about the rubber bullet idea, I think it kinda is self referencing. Which works bc it\u2019s not obvious.\n\nAll in all 8\/10. Interesting book, lotta fun. It\u2019s a coming of age story. I prefer to go in without knowing. But I had heard about it\u2019s masterpiece in horror. So I was biased.

The FBofE is floaty but it's a complete book with an understandable storyline.\n\n Od Magic introduces too many characters too quickly and hints at things that then never make sense. Also I despise when a book doesn't make sense within its rules and Od Magic definitely doesn't. The king is all powerful and afraid of any magic he doesn't understand but there doesn't seem to be any organization about how to stop other magic users. \n\nThere's a magician Tirramen who may or may not use magic, no one knows, and the king's best option is to send one guard in to see if they would have trouble arresting him. There is no investigation into whether or not he has magic, just oh maybe we need to arrest him so see how we would do that. \n\nMost of the other wizards don't like the rules on magic at all and in fact often disagree with them entirely but even though it's made clear multiple times that regular people can't stop wizards, they follow them? \n\nThe one wizard who does like the rules seems to have never considered that there could be any other kinds of magic even though technically his job is I guess to protect the king from outside magic.\n \nAll of the women in the book seem to have jobs and free will, there's no mention of male superiority but the princess is not expected or allowed to have an opinion on who she marries or what she does with her life. \nPeople in the book jump to wild conclusions with almost no evidence. Deciding that just because the princess is missing for a night she's been kidnapped by the gardener who they all think is Tirramen even though multiple characters agree that he isn't. \n\nAnd last but definitely the worst. The Twilight District. It's a whole section of the city that the king is afraid of because there may or may not be uncontrolled magic present. But once again there is nothing working against this. The District stays open as usual, the king doesn't ban anything that's happening there. Once long ago some student wizards got together there and tried to overthrow the rules on magic so no student wizard was ever allowed to go there again? If you're found there you're expelled and then sent home trusted not to learn other magic from somewhere else, for some reason? When it's made blatantly obvious that most people can just learn some kind of magic without any teachers whatsoever. \n\nBut the absolute worst is that for a large portion of the book the Twilight District is completely cut off from the rest of the city and everyone is ok with it. No one is allowed in or out for multiple days and there's no riots in the streets from people who can't get home or to work ECT. No one talks about the huge loss of tourism money, they even block off part of the river, which in any trading city would be really bad for the economy. \n\nOd Magic is a beautifully described book and the idea is awesome but it also feels like a threaded together mess that didn't have much if any for thought put into it.","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1677946294.0},{"title":"I\u2019m Thinking This Will Help Keep Barnes and Noble Alive Against Amazon","author":"HistoricalBelt4482","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11id8f5\/im_thinking_this_will_help_keep_barnes_and_noble\/","text":"My apologies.

As well as the fact we never did hold Hirohito accountable. \n\nHowever, after reading \"Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II\" by John Dower, my perspective on the occupation of Japan has completely shifted. Dower's book presents a comprehensive and thought-provoking account of the post-war period in Japan that goes beyond the typical American narrative.\n\nThrough his meticulous research and vivid storytelling, Dower exposes the complex and often contradictory nature of the occupation. He highlights the struggles and challenges faced by the Japanese people during this period, as well as the tensions and disagreements between the various parties involved in the occupation, including the Americans, Japanese officials, and the Japanese public.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the book is how it highlights the resilience and creativity of the Japanese people during this time of upheaval and reconstruction. Its an event on such a scale that it has never happened before or since, the reforming of a society on such a scale. \n\nOne could argue that the allied occupation of Germany (which started before the Japanese occupation, thus making it a natural blueprint for the future Japanese occupation) was very similar and had basically the same outcome, a facisit warmongering state and its peoples transformed into a peaceful democratic society. Id say the similarities might be in the outcome but the way they came to be are widely different and that the similarities are in fact skin deep, modern day Japan and Germany are actually widely different, \n\n\n\nThe Allies approached the occupations of Japan and Germany differently in terms of their goals and strategies. In Germany, the primary goal was to dismantle the Nazi regime and its associated institutions, and to create a new democratic government. The Allies also sought to punish and hold accountable those responsible for the atrocities committed during the war.\n\nIn Japan, however, the primary goal was to rebuild the country and to create a stable and democratic society. The Allies were less focused on punishing Japanese leaders for their role in the war and instead sought to transform Japan into a peaceful and productive nation. This was reflected in the policies implemented during the occupation, which focused on economic reconstruction, political reform, and cultural change\n\nThirdly, the nature of the societies in Japan and Germany were different. Japan had a highly centralized government and a relatively homogeneous population, while Germany was more diverse and had a federal system of government. These factors influenced the way in which the occupations were conducted and the strategies that were employed.\n\nFinally, the geopolitical context was different. In Germany, the Allies faced the challenge of managing a divided country and addressing the growing tensions between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. In Japan, the United States was the primary occupying power and had greater control over the country's reconstruction.\n\nOverall, while there were similarities in the occupations of Japan and Germany, such as the imposition of new constitutions and the promotion of democratic values, the differences in the scale of destruction, the goals and strategies of the occupying powers, the nature of the societies, and the geopolitical context meant that the occupations were distinct and had different outcomes.\n\n\nGermany, after World War II, underwent a massive restructuring process known as the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" or economic miracle, which was driven by the influx of migrant workers. The systemic removal of racial superiority had been throughly scrubbed from the german psyche allowing for greater understanding and acceptance for the\u201dother\u201d, allowing for the \u201cother\u201d to become German, no longer was it tide to \u201cpure heritage\u201d The German government actively recruited workers from countries like Turkey, Italy, and Greece to help rebuild the country's infrastructure and industries. These guest workers were initially intended to be temporary, but many ended up settling in Germany permanently and forming communities. Over time, these communities have become more integrated into German society, and today, Germany has a large immigrant population and a more welcoming attitude toward immigration. Additionally, the German government has made significant efforts to promote integration and provide support for immigrants.\n\nOn the other hand, Japan's post-war occupation was overseen by the United States, which focused on demilitarizing the country and establishing a democratic government. Japan also experienced a \u201cpost-war economic miracle\u201d when it experienced rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s, but this growth was fueled primarily by domestic investment and export-oriented manufacturing, rather than immigration. Japan however was never forced to accept the \u201cother\u201d like Germany did. Japan's immigration policies have historically been restrictive, with strict visa requirements and limited opportunities for permanent residency. While Japan has recently made some efforts to promote skilled migration and attract foreign workers to address labor shortages, there is still resistance to large-scale immigration and cultural assimilation, these like much of modern Japanese society are remnants of the occupation. \n\nDespite the immense destruction and loss of life, Dower demonstrates how the Japanese people managed to rebuild their lives and their country, often in ways that were very different from what the American occupiers had envisioned. It showcases human resilience and makes me proud to be human, it gives me hope that we can survive anything, we can bounce back from the brink, even when the galaxy begins to fade into darkness, we will be the keepers of the last light. \n\nOverall, \"Embracing Defeat\" is a deeply engaging and enlightening book that provides a nuanced and multi-faceted view of the post-war period in Japan. As someone who typically avoids non-fiction, I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging and accessible Dower's writing is. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in history, politics, or international relations.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677886477.0},{"title":"Giving Up Is Not an Option: Book Censorship News, March 3, 2023","author":"laurpr2","url":"https:\/\/bookriot.com\/giving-up-is-not-an-option-book-censorship-news-march-3-2023\/amp\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1677892419.0},{"title":"Disc- Books that have inspired you or shown you wonders you did not think existed","author":"fantasy_geek00","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11i9i2v\/disc_books_that_have_inspired_you_or_shown_you\/","text":"As a child, I did not read much.

[The Book Leo's video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MC88ehQ14c4) on YouTube proposes a criteria for Dark Academia texts, the most important being #5: Self-critique of the Dark Academia genre. I find her criteria the most comprehensive and so personally define Dark Academia by this, but I'm struggling to find out what the critique in If We Were Villains is.\n\nIn *The Secret History*, it's about the dangers of aesthetic and its escapism. Richard forces his way into the Greek club even though it's clear the professor is elitist, and he's so determined to keep up this pretence that he's as privileged as everyone else that he almost freezes in the winter. When they kill Bunny, it's because he found out about the murder and was threatening to expose them; the murder happened because of Henry's impossible chase after the aesthetic, and Bunny's knowledge was threatening their aesthetic of being intelligent, respectable classics students. In my interpretation, anyways.\n\nSo what's the message in *If We Were Villains*? What is M.L. Rio critiquing? At first I thought it might be the same as *The Secret History* \\- Richard only begins to change once the casting has shifted, once he has lost the power of being the guaranteed lead role; perhaps he's so desperate for the escapism of the aesthetic that he begins to act out. But none of the other characters really suffer from this. Moreover, Oliver's taking the fall for James has nothing to do with aesthetic, it's to do with love. But how is love a critique of the Dark Academia genre?\n\nI'd be really interested in seeing what other people think of this.

If anything, it was even better than I remembered - the action and big tech ideas had stuck with me, but I'd forgotten how funny this book is!\n\n**Here's the setup** (back of the book style, but in spoiler tags in case you like to go in totally blind)**:** >!Hiro Protagonist (yes, you read that right - the book really isn't trying to take itself too seriously) is a self-described hacker working as a pizza-delivery driver and living in a storage unit at LAX.!<\n\n>!He lives in a US that has been fully corporatized - from Judge Bob\u2019s Judicial System to Pastor Wayne\u2019s Pearly Gates.!<\n\n>!To get away, Hiro spends much of his free-time in the Metaverse, where he wrote many of the subroutines that underpin the virtual world. One of his hacker friends, Da5id, is given a new virtual drug called Snow Crash that not only crashes his computer, but also destroys his brain in the real world. Hiro (and a hilarious cadre of friends) are drawn ever deeper into the worldwide conspiracy that is spilling out of the virtual world to threaten the real world.!<\n\nThere are so many things about this book I love, but I\u2019ll try to pick just a few to highlight:\n\nFirst, the big tech ideas that stuck with me over the twenty years since I read it the first time. It has the most fun and engrossing description of a VR world that I've read so far - it's everything *Ready Player One* was trying to be and so much more. It even coined the term Metaverse! Then there is the skateboard with smart wheels that adjusts to the terrain so you can skate right over potholes (or even down a forested hillside). A nuclear-powered gatling gun in a suitcase. And so, so many others.\n\nThe narrative voice is also amazing and truly unique. Humor rare in sci-fi, but this book shows that it can be done really successfully. The narrator establishes the general satirical tone, but it also adjusts to match whichever character it's currently following. That match of narrative voice to character brings us into the world in a much deeper way, and is also a big part of making all characters so likeable and fun. Are they burnouts or are they superheroes? Why not both!\n\nOne watch out - there is one cringe-inducing section of the book where one of the main characters, who is 15, gets sexually involved with an adult. Its a bad guy who is pursuing her, so presumably Neal Stephenson would say it was part of establishing him as evil - but it still feels like it could have been avoided without taking anything away from the book.\n\nFinally, the 'big idea' underneath the novel is really interesting. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say its about the intersection of language, religion, and ideas as viruses and potential tools of control. The actual details of how Snow Crash itself works in the book are a little ridiculous, but given the overall ridiculous tone of the novel it totally fits, and doesn't take away from the very-thought provoking big idea.\n\nIf you haven't read it, check it out - you're in for such a fun, wild ride!\n\nPS: Part of an ongoing series covering the best sci-fi books of all time.

I felt sad, even though there was no dramatic ending, it was actually good. Still I felt like there was an empty hole left in my chest after finishing it. This feeling lasted for the rest of the day.\n\nInitially I thought it was due to my difficult relationship to sex (there were a lot of sex scenes in that book), but it's not the first time I felt in such a way after finishing a book I enjoyed (it was more intense this time though).\n\nAfter a little bit of research, I discovered there was such a thing called \"post book depression\", where people feel sad after finishing a book they enjoyed.

It took me about five months to finish it but every second kept me engrossed. It started when I read a post here probably close to a year ago singing its praises, and immediately put it on my ever-growing 'to read' list. After getting it for my birthday last year, I finally sat down and started reading it in early September of 2022.\n\nComing from reading basically only non-fiction works, I was surprised by how this book *immediately* got me hooked. I fell in love with Edmond Dantes character, and his betrayal, loss and heartbreak genuinely affected me. I found myself so frustrated at his turmoil, and wanted nothing more than his revenge to be brutal and all encompassing. Seeing the fall from grace of this young, idealistic and just genuinely good hearted kid, into a cynical, mean-spirited and extravagant man was just something that made me feel emotions from words on a page I had never experienced previously.\n\nReally the entire cast of characters Dumas created I found to be extremely compelling and interesting to read about. Off the top of my head there's Noirteir, the entire Danglars family, Andrea Cavalcanti, and Hayd\u00e8e to name a few. And of course the titular Count was the star of the show every time he appeared on page. I found myself as in awe of him as were the people around him. His long drawn out plan of revenge was as fun to behold as it was impossible to predict. I do wish we could've heard about the aftermath of all the characters. I was particularly interested in what happened afterwards to more minor characters such as Andrea and Franz specifically. I felt as though their characters had quite a lot of build-up but were essentially forgotten about once they'd fulfilled their purpose to the Count. \n\nOther than that, the bit of a slog in the middle, and a few minor gripes (Didn't get the translation by Buss so apparently there were quite a few changes and removals made in my translation) I think this is quite possible my favorite book I've read. Certainly my longest read!\n\nI'd love to hear everyone else's thoughts!\n\nEdit: Also for all those wondering, I read the Barnes and Nobles bound leatherback edition.

One thing that continually frustrates me is the casual behaviors of the characters. It seems super shallow and cliche. \n\nTake Holden for example. He seems so incredibly immature for someone in his position and with his experience. The constant quips and dry humor are frustrating to me. Him being so upset at not having coffee is what made me stop the second book. Telling people how \"cranky\" he will be, it's like he's not a captain of a warship but a college student bragging about their caffeine addiction. \n\n\nFurthermore, some writing just confuses me. Mainly the characters inconsistency. Like Miller being all pessimistic at the idea of young belters joining the OPA to fight for their dreams or patriotism or whatever. But then obsessing over Julie who was doing the same exact thing. \n\nBut that's not a huge issue. I just want to know if the Marvel-esque casual dialogue that nearly every single character uses, and is completely immersion breaking continues through the series or not.

My favourite character is definitely Glen Batemen and Tom Cullen, laws Yes! Anyway I reread the poem The Second Coming by William Butler Yeats which is mentioned by Starkey in the beginning of the book. It seems like almost every line has a deep relation to events that occur in the book and I thought this was fascinating so heres my thoughts:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Turning and turning in the widening gyre  \nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;\n\n* This suggests humans are unable to hear gods messages to them in modern times and are disconnected from religion, this is referenced a few times throughout the book.\n\n>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\n\n* The idea the destruction of the world occured because of our modern habits that are opposed to nature such as pollution and waste. This is also referenced a few times in the book.\n\n>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  \nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  \nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\n\n* This references the death of possible billions and the idea that captain trips destroyed all characters physically and mentally, completely upending there life. While forcing them, like Nick sending Tom Cullen away, to make tough decisions.\n\n>The best lack all conviction, while the worst  \nAre full of passionate intensity.\n\n* This relates to how many of the good characters like Stu, Larry and Nick have no passion to lead but are forced into that position due to circumstance and their character. This contrasts with Randall Flagg's inherent anger and fury at the east and his need for death and destruction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Surely some revelation is at hand;  \nSurely the Second Coming is at hand.\n\n* This links to the idea that captain trips was viewed intially by some, like Nadine as some heavenly judgement and condemnation of the actions of humanity.\n\n>The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out  \nWhen a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi  \nTroubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert\n\n* Here \"Spiritus Mundi\" is reffering to a collective conciousness, this seems similiar to the almost universal dreams of evil (and good) that almost all the characters subconciously share.\n\n>A shape with lion body and the head of a man,  \nA gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,\n\n* This clearly relates to the represantation of Randall Flagg as a thin human shell over some sort of pure evil demonic form, which is visible through his eyes. The lion body represents his fury, power and threating nature.\n\n>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it  \nReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.\n\n* This immediatly suggests death as a dying body is watched by birds waiting to peck at the corpse. But also this links to the references of crows and how Flagg's control of them to achieve his malcious goals.\n\n>The darkness drops again; but now I know  \nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep  \nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,\n\n* Babies are mentioned very often throughout the book, like at the end where Fran's son Peter is almost like the start of a new age.\n\n>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,  \nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*I don't know much about religion and poetry but I enjoyed the poem and thought the connections I saw were intresting enough to share.

He goes to an academy to acquire mastery in magic as he was already having basics done while working in his fields with his father.  \n\n\nFurther, He meets his best friend, Ace and falls in love with Alea. After four years of their course, the master of academy, Eldar, Alea's father, tells them that they need to fight a war with zordacs, who are trying to conquer the world.  \n\n\nThe author has tried his best to knit this saga with utmost and meticulous precision in a first person narration which will give you some thrills too in between. Though, the story could be better structurally edited from the reader's perspective as this book needs a seasoned reader who can absorb and retain so much information while reading the same.  \n\n\nThe characters are very engaging and brilliantly chosen. The names of the characters, plot, setting, conflicts, all these are prodigiously executed by the author. All the characters have done their part remarkably well to make this book a flashy and thrilling read.  \n\n\nThe story is a bit slow having lots of unfamiliar names but the language of the book is legible and lucid that the readers will be hooked to the story till the very end. In spite of several limitations of writing such pieces, the author has overcome those challenges very smartly by not messing up the saga entirely through his apt words and storytelling skills. Overall, it's a must recommended if you want to read something different and interesting. \n\nthis is my take on the novel and if anyone her has read this extremely underrated novel then please do share your opinion of it.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1677835398.0},{"title":"Times when you actually liked the movie more than the book?","author":"AstonianSoldier","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11f3vot\/times_when_you_actually_liked_the_movie_more_than\/","text":"It is often said \"the book is better than the movie\" because the book can give you so much detail and insight where a movie doesn't have the time.\n\nAre there any times when you actually liked the movie more?\n\nI have 2 examples where I actually liked the movie version more than the book.\n\n1 The Hunt for Red October (Tom Clancy) I liked the book and consider it a good book but there is something about the movie that really grabbed me and emotionally involved me more than the book.\n\n2.

While initially frustrated with the lack of quotation and a somewhat simplistic prose that seemed to struggle with the pointless back and forth between the protagonists (both of whom I found quite unlikeable at first), I found myself rooting for the characters way more than I thought I would. After a point, I didn't even find the conversations that they were having to be pointless and towards the end, I wanted more of it. I wanted them to keep on talking to each other because them trying to understand each other through subtle confession of their feelings somehow made the initial angst of lack of communication even more delicious.\n\nI think Rooney has managed to capture the loneliness that stems from the awareness we have of ourselves and others and the deep-seated need to belong to someone or something perfectly. What's more, the indecisiveness when it came to their feelings for each other (not really their feelings but more like the uncertain way they acted towards each other) that seemed to arise from an unspoken assumption of what the other would want made both Marianne and Connell as real to me as I myself am, and I am grateful that they made me feel normal in my own skin, my relationships, and my past. While my friend hated the open-ish ending, I loved it, because we do end up leaving a lot of chapters in our life open, and for some reason, it made me feel hopeful.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1677714484.0},{"title":"Books that got you into Reading: March 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/books\/comments\/11g11re\/books_that_got_you_into_reading_march_2023\/","text":"Welcome readers,\n\nToday is [Read Across America](https:\/\/www.nea.org\/professional-excellence\/student-engagement\/read-across-america) and [World Book Day](https:\/\/www.worldbookday.com\/)!

I read Foundation after seeing some emphatic suggestions here, and really found it a slog. It seemed obsessed\/fascinated with its own theories of economic downfall - instead of its characters. Characters felt like a delivery vehicle for these theories. Dialog was unnatural. Characters established\/discarded rapidly. I know it was originally published as individual short pieces but, man.\n\nPerhaps this is unfair and it's more about the context with which it was written. And everything which came after it...?\n\nIs Asimov's fiction really his highest achievement? Or is it that he was all these things - a polymath - and a sheerly prolific writer... and it's more of a cumulative effect which determines his status.\n\nIt occurs to me that this is something written by a scientist who doesn't really grasp the emotional requirements of fiction... but Clarke was an esteemed scientist and I find his writing absolutely riveting emotionally.\n\nAny and all thoughts welcome!\n\n\\[EDIT\\] Thank you everyone.
