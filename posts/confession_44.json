I’ve trained my brain to tell myself it’s okay. That’s what happens in life. They love me. They don’t mean to hurt me. But they do. Every single time. I am who I am because of these experiences, but I wonder who I could be without them. Without the experience of begging them to stop. Saying no. Please don’t. A life without being triggered by a single touch. A look. A motion. Even the acceptance of their guilt won’t change it. It wouldn’t change myself and who I am today. But I still wonder who I could be. Who I would have been without these speed bumps. I was always raised to respect myself and others around me. Maybe that’s where I failed. Always seeing the good. Or trying to, at least. Always wanting to be the bigger person and let it go. But sometimes, you can’t. You have to put yourself first and know that certain things aren’t okay. That you don’t have to try and protect everyone. Because they would get in trouble and what happened would upset their lives. Well now I’m putting myself first. I’m no longer worrying about anyone’s life but my own. From now on. I’m living for me. When I say no. It means no. When I say stop or don’t do that. I mean it. I am hurt, but I will grow. And I will do everything I can to make sure it never happens again.",

I can't read his mind so idk if he was really using me but I know what I was doing lol. plus the game came with perks like amazon gifts, holiday gifts and cash. \n\nthis isn't a flex but I feel like he could've blocked me whenever so the guilt he carries is his problem low-key. and no I didn't send him stuff like it was my freaking job but I tried at the beginning but it was boring and took too much time. The perks kicked in when I started acting like I was in love with him.\n\nthanks for reading, def more confessions to come. xoxo a bored girl.",

The hate I’ve grown for humanity due to how I’ve been treated for being unattractive. The way my brain will never process weight and body image like most of the world. I’ve tried everything. fasting, keto, starving, vegan, fad diets. I even began to eat paper as a way to try to stay full. I am a empty balloon who wants to pop.  Why do I have a hole inside of me? I tried fixing my mental health to loose weight. I tried making it worse to loose weight. I tried witchcraft, I tried meditation, hypnosis. I tried punishing myself and I’ve tried to love myself. Neither work. I’m exhausted. I’d say I’m content with myself but it’s a lie. I base my own self worth on others opinions of me. Even though I hate most of the world I’m still suffering by following the standards they have been serving me. I’m so tired. I don’t believe in humanity but I’m apart of it. I’m still thinking like everyone else is because if I wasn’t I wouldn’t be here right now typing this up. I’m afraid to die, 1. Because I’m scared of what’s to come but 2. I’m scared I’ll die without ever being thin. If only I could reach my potential. I feel like people lie when they say you aren’t happier when your thin. I’d rather be miserable and beautiful than miserable and ugly the way I am now",
