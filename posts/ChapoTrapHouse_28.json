        "text": "Sjw don't necessarily exist either tbh. It's just a libel term coined by whites to describe anyone who has the audacity to be politically incorrect (which. I thought you guys loved ? Ah ,only when it enables you to criticize black and brown people, typical fucking hypocrites ) and expose scientifically proven theories like white privilege , white supremacy, or exposing sexism . The reeeeing sjw who literally hate white men are pretty damn rare. The ones who do will be sucking white conservative dick in 10 years or less and vote republican. Just look at laci green; statistics prove that today's liberals will be republicans in the future. Whiteness is just too seductive to resist. Hell , you already see it with things like #walk away or alt left liberals like the kind of Dave Rubin or Jordan Peterson; its a white liberal backlash based on the fact that liberals no longer represent white identity.  It's too black. It's too female. Ah , but nothing can be too white. Many white liberals are now trying to push the narrative of distinction between 'liberal' , 'leftie,  and ' classical liberalism'. Classical liberalism is basically liberalism but devoid of black, brown and female identity politics . Basically liberal , white identity politics pre-2000s. Basically \" hey , hey ,hey , guys , I'm a liberal but im white likw you guys\" White conservatives should know that White liberals would love nothing more than for the DNC to stop talking about race and sex. \n\nThe vast majority of liberals are imperceivable compared to republicans regarding identity politics aND racial problems. Most white liberals do not support things like BLM , third wave feminism , ethnic diversity and scientifically proven theories like white privilege. In your big liberal city, how many lgbtq flags have you seen ? Ok, now how many black lives matter flags have you seen ? Exactly. Poc: white liberals are not our friends. Most white liberals want exactly what republicans want which is a clean , affluent , majority white population that speaks the Kings language with houses that fly a big America flag instead of a Puerto Rican or mexican one . The major ways in which they differ are on abortion rights for their white liberal women , taxes , fiscal policy , gay rights for their white lgbt cousin Glen and free shit from grandpa bernie. They could care less about some \" people of color\" LMAO , shitting next to a black man in a strip mall or anything else racial. Yet you clowns will still vote for them. They're WHITE FIRST and don't you fucking forget it.The only time they like diversity is if it means eating ethnic flavored fat, salt and sugar (Muh tacos and Indian food. Yay diversity!) or placing a condo on top and displacing your starving mexican grandmother under the contingency that that diverse neighborhood will.be majority white at sone point(gentrification ). \n\n\nRemember the lady who sued that clinic for giving her black sperm? Liberal, lgbtq. She wanted white sperm.  Genetically superior white genetics. She sees you, your phenotype , your literal DNA and biology as inherently inferior. But its just preferences right? Ok, cool. Now, if that same lady goes to a job aND the employer says   \"I'm sorry mam but we only hire men here; I'm sorry but it's just my preference \" she would claim sexism and she would want your black vote to support her and get some anti white female discrimination  laws on the books. If you dont, youre a bigot. Lol get the fuck outta here. Their whiteness supercedes everything else, and don't you ever forget it.  \n\n\n\nLast week I was homeless waiting on a lease to go through; I slept in my car. In less than 48 hours, the cops were called on me 6 times . I'm in chicago,  a liberal city.  Yor progressive friends!  The deep north! You could argue that my actions were suspicious and race had absolutely nothing to do with it , but watch this and you tell me. https://youtu.be/8ABRlWybBqM.  If i was one of these  white female hipsters around here , that 6 turns into 1 or zero , in fact, I'm pretty sure that would have helped me. Why? Because white is white and don't you ever fucking forget it. I'm a nigger first and they're white first. \n\nAs black man, I support neither party . I only support my own people. All Poc should do the same and realize no one will invest in you like people who look like you. I know white liberals have perverted you into thinking everything is koombaya, yeah , while he goes to the bank and patronizes and supports mainly white people while your community is Malinvested in lol.  Fuck that, play the exact game that whites do on a daily basis. Subversion.  Perversion. Duplicity.  Dominance. Corruption. Racism. Identify politics.",

I listen to Pod Save America on occasion when Chapo leaves me bereft of content for several grueling hours at a time (I'm sure a lot of you motherfuckers do too, but at least I'm honest about it) and the \"angriest\" PodBro, i.e. the only one with a real personality, has always been one Tomothy Vietor.\n\nOn their latest ep, he did an almost word-for-word takedown of Kavanaugh that could have been a Klassik Khristman rant. Even used a lot of the same terminology, and was the one to bring up the completely fucking insane Ed Whelan Twitter shit.\n\nThis ain't even the first time he's done this. I saw them live (fuck you I live in the south and Chapo categorically refuses to come here) and on stage he was WAY more of a raging leftist than they actually put out on the recordings. It was kind of fascinating to watch.\n\nSo in closing I'm pretty sure Vietor cribs from our dryboys and passes it off as his own content, potentially to subtly radicalize their listeners.",
