        "text": "I ended a 7 month relationship with a guy who I believe shows major signs of narcissism. I have experienced narcissism before, but each time is so confusing and I have a natural attraction to be drawn toward them. \n\nI took about 5 days of space last week to really think things over about my relationship (and also pray - I'm a Christian). I was feeling constant anxiety and distress, even when he would call me. I feel like the past few weeks I have felt uneasy and, although I definitely had my belief that he was a narc the whole relationship... it became more and more clear. After taking space, I made the decision to leave.\n\nWe talked Sunday and things didn't end bad. We talked in person, but then he left and called me once he got home to talk even more. I explained for 2 hours why I was ending it and I thought we had an understanding. This is the second time I've left and after the first time we got back together, unfortunately not much changed about our relationship. He has always tried to \"change\" or make promises, so I've been holding onto hope and really believed we would get married.\n\nIt has just been recently where I realized we can barely have a convo without him belittling me and me feeling anxiety, we barely if ever had fun together anymore, etc. \n\nI've been hurting the past couple days and feel depressed, but I know my discernment is right and through pray I know God doesn't want this for me. \n\nBut today he called me, I missed his call. Then he texts me \n\n\"Good morning, can you call me back when you get a chance?\"\n\nI asked him \"what is the call for?\"\n\nHe responded with \"to see if we can schedule a follow up at the end of the month\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called him back and it was an almost instant guilt trip because I didn't understand why he would think this. I asked what is going to change by then? His response was just \"sorry, no I just wanted to make sure...we talked about not letting pride get in the way and that we'd still be in prayer\" (he said these things, I made it clear it was over on Sunday - he told me to not let pride keep me from reaching out) I never said I would still be in prayer about our relationship. I believe God has answered me about our relationship.\n\nThere was no understanding that I came to the conclusion and trusted my discernment that something was wrong, that I haven't been happy and that I have reasons for not trusting him.\n\nAll he kept saying was sorry which made me feel guilty and that now things aren't ending on peaceful terms. It was frustrating. \"I said I don't want an apology, I wanted you to show me I can trust you\" and I hung up.\n\nNow I feel immense guilt and now don't feel at peace...even though I have been sad, I've felt peaceful about my decision.",

        "text": "Sorry for the long post, but I feel I need to get this out of my system.\n\nToday, I had an interesting encounter with a colleague at work. The communication with this person has always been strained - such as dominantly overexplaining work-related concepts like I'm a child and verbal irritability because I joked around with a colleague. Looking back, the other colleagues have also tacitly described her as a difficult/negative person at times, even if she is a hard and valued worker (red flag!). But this encounter truly was an eye-opening moment. The coffee machine in the cafeteria suddenly broke down and briefly gushed water on the floor. I radioed my supervisor to let him know, that I would see what I can do to fix it, and that I would ask for help if I needed assistance. But before I could finish my transmission, this person interjected with \"I'm coming over right now.\" I thought whatever, maybe that was misunderstanding.. And besides, a bit of guidance doesn't hurt in fixing a commercial-grade machine. But the attitude she had coming in oozed \"get the fuck out of my way, I'll fix it myself.\" This immediately bothered the hell out of me because she has been condescending to me before (completely disregarding me saying \"I understand\" before explaining something *three* times!). It also bothered me because if I'm never fixing the machine myself, how the hell am I ever supposed to learn? And it just downright fucks with my sense of autonomy. I don't like it when people hijack something that I'm doing, especially when making disparaging comments or not saying anything at all. \n\nSo her demeanor already threw me off. Next she wanted to remove my chair from the large booth in which the coffee machine sat. Because I was already rubbed the wrong way, I literally put my hand on the chair when she pulled on it and said \"it's fine where it is, you can access the coffee machine just fine.\" As a rule, she probably dislikes having the chair in there when she's working, but IDGAF because it was my station for the day. I can't remember what she said exactly, but she was super irritated and defensive over my putting down a boundary. She started on the machine and I went away for a second to clean a part of it. At that moment, I realized that maybe it would help if I voiced how I felt. So I went back and in the most reasonable voice I said \"the reason I'm a little bit rash is because I don't like having people hijack what I'm doing.\" If you guessed that this colleague went off the rails after that, you're completely right. She tore me a new one because I supposedly did ask for help (I clearly did not) and because she interpreted my transmission as an emergency call (lmao over a coffee machine). I replied with \"well, you can ascribe those to genuine misunderstandings, but the actual point is that I don't like how you're treating me.\" Again missing the point, she justified having taken over because the cafeteria had too many waiting customers for me (being less experienced) to fix it. A clear lie because I can count the day's customers on one hand!\n\nThe worst part is that she kept talking over me when I tried to explain why I took offense to her behavior. When I protested she said \"No! Now I'm going to talk!\" OK, so I let her talk. I took over she had finished her sentences. She interrupted me again and I said \"I allowed you to talk, now I would appreciate it if you would be quiet.\" She did not give a damn and kept talking and talking over me. When another colleague came by to check on the machine she snarkily said that I \"didn't want any help and knew better than everyone else.\" She turned to me: \"Go fix the machine on your own then.\" At this point I just very angrily told her to get out of my face, which she did because the colleague took her away. Fun fact is that I did manage to fix the machine on my own! I was rattled by the entire situation. An hour later she came to relieve my post for lunch. Even if I had a fight with someone, I try to remain somewhat empathic. So I made the conscious effort of thanking her for relieving me despite what happened. She looked at me and did not say a word as I walked by. And at the end of the day, I saw her standing alone at the reception. I again wanted to show myself at my best despite the conflict. So I said bye to her as I walked by. No response, she definitely heard it but intentionally did not reply. While I walked out of the door I just laughed at her childishness without looking her way. This drew her ire. She suddenly shouted ... something(?) \n\nI also ended up talking to two supervisors about the situation. I explained to them that I was angry because she took away my autonomy. The two were in agreement that she probably didn't mean it that way and that if I were to voice it to her directly, she would probably be more constructive. Although I didn't say it to them, inside I was like \"heeeeeeeeeell no am I talking to her. I tried to be reasonable before and look how that ended up! No way does she suddenly have empathy or an understanding.\" So yay, work is ruined now. She is a decade senior and I've been working there four months. I'm already looking forward to her mobilizing her flying monkies and smearing me out of the wazoo.",

        "text": "I want to preface this by saying that I do not want my ex back. I highly suspect that she is a quiet BPD or covert narcissist. Not sure which is why I‚Äôm posting this in multiple places. She ripped out my heart, betrayed me after nearly 15 years, and chose her affair partner over me. The only reason I‚Äôm curious about how long this might work out is because frankly it pisses me off that she is happy and living her best life after ruining me. I want to see this blow up in her face so she will be left with nothing. Hopefully she tries to come back so I can tell her ‚ÄúNO‚Äù. It may be petty but that‚Äôs how I feel right now.\n\nAnyway, here are some of the key details that I think could affect the length of her new romance, in no particular order. I don‚Äôt know if this stuff would indicate a higher chance of failure or success, so I‚Äôm just curious what you all think. \n\nReasons why I think this might last/she won‚Äôt try to come back\n\n1. Our relationship seemed great for 13 years. We had minor issues but nothing big happened until this most recent year. If she can stay in a relationship for that long without issue, she might stay in this one a long time too.\n2. Over the past year we had arguments stemming from communication issues. She would never admit fault or take responsibility and would gaslight me and lie to me to avoid the truth or compromise. She likely won‚Äôt want to return to me if her new relationship fails so she might hold on to the new guy longer if there are problems.\n3. On a few occasions I threatened to break up with her because of how frustrated and hopeless she was making me feel. I apologize the next morning each of the few times this happened but she considers this mental abuse.\n4. She told me that I had been invalidating her opinions but couldn‚Äôt give examples, and that I had been breaking her down for a long tome (calling her out for her behavior).\n5. She told me she stopped feeling the same way about me a long time ago. That she loves me but isn‚Äôt in love with me.\n6. She says she is in love with her new partner. Even calls him her soul mate. She themed her relationship around characters from a particular romantic story and seems totally obsessed with this fairytale romance.\n7. She chose him over me with no hesitation when I discovered the affair. She has already moved in with him.\n8. She isn‚Äôt your typical cluster B type, and she doesn‚Äôt start arguments most of the time. It took a very long time for me to see the cracks in her persona. It might take the new guy even longer. \n9. I think right now she genuinely views me as a villain and her new man is her hero.\n10. The new guy is my polar opposite but she may think of him as more ‚Äúmanly‚Äù. Big hairy bearded guy who drives a big truck. Much worse looking IMO but in better shape than me. Maybe she thinks of me now as a boy and this guy is a ‚Äúman‚Äù.  \n\nReasons why I think this will NOT last/she might try to come back\n\n1. I am the longest and only relationship she has ever had. We met in high school. Lost our virginity to each other. Moved across the country with each other. We have a massive shared history and I am the only other person she knows here.\n2. She had a great life with me with plenty of comforts, and we normally got along great and shared all of the same interests. The man she chose is dirt poor and they are living in a crappy apartment in the middle of nowhere commuting to their minimum wage jobs together 45 minutes away because they couldn‚Äôt afford to live in this city and she doesn‚Äôt drive.\n3. They are both cheaters who left their families to be together. Her new partner is a serial cheater and has several previous marriages/children. \n4. She is still in contact with me and since she moved the last of her stuff out (after dragging her feet/cancelling for weeks), she began texting me and talking about random stuff, asking me to help her find things or remember things that she definitely already knows, and sending me pictures of our cat. I have been grey rocking as much as possible but not NC.\n5. She seemed genuinely sad and remorseful when all this happened and each time she came back to get some of her stuff, although she is firm that she is making the right decision. She does however keep leaving stuff behind in my opinion to make an excuse to contact me again.\n6. They both work together. And since they have the same schedules and commute together, they have now gone from having an exciting secret affair to living, working and being with each other 24/7.\n7. They have only known each other for about 3 months and started the affair a month and a half ago.\n8. He is a ghost on social media and she is keeping her relationship a secret both online and in real life, even from her family. The only people who know are her coworkers and closest friends.\n9. This guy has zero ambition or ability to provide her a decent life. I also doubt he will be as patient with her as I was and likely expects her to cook and clean and pull her own weight (good luck with that).\n10. I just have a gut feeling that this isn‚Äôt going to last and that she is going to try to hoover me and come back once her situation starts to look less appealing. Maybe she is already doing that a little. She doesn‚Äôt seem like she is happy even though she tells me that she is. I‚Äôm sure she is genuinely happy in this moment right now but I have a feeling she is also starting to see what she lost.\n\n\nAll in all, I‚Äôm just hoping this blows up quickly. Maybe it will last for years. Maybe she will get pregnant immediately since she has had baby fever for a while and they‚Äôll get married and live happily ever after with their new family. I don‚Äôt know. I could see this going either way to be honest. But it would help me to cope if I knew it would fail. Karma has to have something to say about this, right?",

Some might find it offensive, especially if Jesus is helping you heal.\n\n2 years since discard, 32 year relationship, 4 young adult and teenage kids.\n\nOne of our kids decided to ask some difficult questions to her mom, in particular, why she left, and peppered it with, \"Because we don't know, and Dad doesn't know either.\" It's true, she hasn't ever told me why she left, and more importantly (because I know why BPD and NPD people leave), she hasn't ever told the kids.\n\nHer mom lied to her. She blamed Christianity, which I think is fascinating. She claimed that she \"lost herself\" in the ideology that as a wife, she was supposed to do as the husband said. This is such a huge pile of bullshit. The fact is that she made all, if not most of the decisions. Homeschooling, becoming vegetarians, moving away from my family, not having a job so she could be a mom and homeschool teacher, ending teaching them and enrolling them in a coop, not going to church, going to bars and drinking, and so many other things. As you can tell, I was the perfect supply for her, bending to her every whim.\n\nBut one thing is for sure, I NEVER ascribed to Ephesians 5:22, not this interpretation that she's using anyway. I saw that as oppression, unrealistic, and irrelevant to our relationship and respect and human rights. We had many conversations about this. We agree we were a team. So for her to say this means a great deal. We studied the bible back then. This interpretation is not the real interpretation. It's the one that non Christians use when claiming Christianity is oppressive. Shit gets complicated around interpretations, and I fear I'm gonna offend someone if I keep going on this.\n\nOf course, she made it sound like she was a victim, and totally innocent. Such a big lie, but kind of a perfect lie. It's fascinating. This is the perfect lie. Blame Jesus. Hate Christianity. Claim victimization. Blame me, but make it so no one is gonna confront me because of my beliefs. Truth is, I stopped believing long before she did.\n\nI am convinced that this is what she's told all of our mutual friends who ghosted me after we divorced.\n\nThe important people (the kids) see right through this, which means now they see her even more as a liar. And are more confused. Heartbreaking.",

Anyway my father refuses to give us a  passport and my mom spent a lot of money trying to get him to do it with lawyers but he kept leading her on with no aveil. He then divorced my mom because she was going to complain about this  issue with my family and he wanted to save face. He‚Äôs a deadbeat now we rarely see him and he has a new family and 3 stepsiblings that I never want to meet. The reason I was a emotional because all those years he was thinking about himself she led her on about the passport because he had a shitty one so we moved to the U.K. for a while and he ended up with that passport but we got nothing HE WAS THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF the entire time he never looked out for us at all. Sometimes I‚Äôm envious that he isn‚Äôt in my life then I remember he‚Äôs poor in the U.K. in a crap apartment. Narcissistic deadbeats ruin a child because I‚Äôll never know what it‚Äôs like to have a dad ever and he took that away from me I‚Äôm grateful for my mom but we live in a country where two family homes are the norm so it‚Äôs hard not to get jealous.

She kept trying to convince me it wasn't the case, but I thought I'd just been manipulating her. I've been writing (but not sending, as I didn't want to cause more damage) apology letters to my ex daily, and I've been reaching out to friends to apologize for the person I've become. Everyone has been confused which made me feel worse because I felt like I've been horribly deceitful. \n\n\nI've felt absolutely unintelligible to myself and have been constantly distraught because everything feels wrong. My ex had started suggesting I had B cluster personality traits, then CPTSD. Later, when he had YouTube up I saw videos on his recommendation/watch again about how to manage narcissists and he lied and said he never searched that and didn't think I was a narcissist, even though he made a lot of implications that I was. \n\nI bought into it all. It wasn't until this evening when he responded to an apology post I made on r/breakups from his alternate Reddit account that I saw a comment he made on this subreddit did I realize how skewed everything was. He left out so much stuff and painted me into this awful and unreasonable person, despite us having so many heartfelt back and forth conversations. When we broke up I was devastated, but I made that call because I thought I was this caustic, awful person. I was so set on fixing myself to be better and hopefully find him again in the future and make it up to him. Our last interaction was when I asked to come say goodbye one last time and bring him the Valentine's day gifts I made him. He didn't even cry. Everything was fake. All the messages he sent me saying how proud he is of me for working on myself, how much he loves me... They were fake. When I compare all of his messages and emails to the post he made, I see how saccharine it all is.\n\n\nWhere do I go from here? What do I do? I feel like I'm in a whirlwind. I have already been struggling so much with the person I thought I'd become but I've been lied to?? \n\nI'm sorry if this is all chaotic, all of the little things that I put aside in my mind are crashing down and a whole lot of stuff is making more sense. I had been thinking he started talking to/seeing someone else while we were still together and I now think that was the case... \n\nBut then what if this is all me being neurotic or trying to make myself a victim when I'm the aggressor? My brain is absolutely scrambled and I don't know what's real or just me.\n\n\nMy heart feels like it's broken all over again.",

Empathy seems disqualifying.\n\nThe N in my life, however, does possess what I am calling a \"socioeconomic empathy,\" in that in her profession (she's retired now) she genuinely worked to help impoverished children. However, her brand of empathy does not translate to her personal relationships, where she behaves like a textbook narcissist. No boundaries, insatiable neediness, seething anger and lashing out when her needs are not met, no consideration for other pulls on people's lives, etc. She will drain you like a fucking vampire.\n\nSo, there's her \"socioeconomic empathy\" on the one hand, and her lack of personal empathy on the other. And when I ask myself, how is this possible‚Äîcan it even be possible for someone to have that kind of disconnect?‚ÄîI can only say this is what I have observed and experienced.\n\nYour thoughts welcome.

        "text": "Last Sunday I ended up having a party with a boy... I had no intention, but a boy I've liked for many years spoke to me and well, I let myself go, especially because we were very comfortable.\n\nWe ended up being together from Sunday night to Tuesday at noon and it was all very intense. It started as something just sexual, but it quickly turned into something romantic that made me break down all the barriers that I had built for myself and that I didn't even realize I had.\n\nIt changed from sex to making love, to telling us that we loved each other, to a very intimate and romantic connection... And the truth is that I was terrified, but it seemed to me that we were both experiencing everything on the same level. The thing is, since we broke up, we haven't talked.\n\nOn Friday night I asked him for an explanation, telling him to please tell me if everything had been real or not, because it was overwhelming me and everything had been sincere on my part. But he didn't answer me, until Saturday, when he only told me that he had been sick and that he hadn't paid attention to his cell phone. But he did not answer any of the questions nor has he ever spoken to me again.\n\nThe thing is that for a long time, maybe three years ago, my penultimate relationship, which was traumatic, I had not felt so vulnerable and open. After that relationship was when I was with my Nex, who took advantage of all those insecurities, traumas and barriers to manipulate me.\n\nRight now I'm feeling a lot of things, both positive and negative, and I'm having a really hard time assimilating and living with them. With my Nex, he didn't allow me to feel them, because he gaslighted me or punished me for expressing them.\n\nI am managing not to fall into consumption, or alcohol or anything. But I feel everything very intensely and I don't want to \"turn off\" the feelings or emotions because I have realized that this is what I did after my penultimate relationship and I know that it is not healthy.\n\nBut it's getting very hard for me not knowing what to do with all this that I have inside, especially because what I want most is to be able to meet him again and to be able to show him everything that makes me feel. But he doesn't answer me and I don't even know if he's really interested and all he told me was about the heat or if he really is sick.\n\nBecause I did see that on Friday afternoon he connected to a dating app, and that hurt me a lot. Though it hasn't reconnected. But I do have a recurring negative thought that perhaps, the same thing we were doing together, he has been doing since Friday with another boy.\n\nExcuse me for the Bible that I just wrote to you, but it is difficult for me to channel everything I feel in a positive way, without falling into obsessing or negative behaviors. I feel a lot of energy inside from all of this, but I'm not used to it after so many years with so much anxiety and depression that essentially made me feel nothing.\n\nI don't know how to live a healthy relationship now, nor how to start it. I don't know what a behavior learned from toxic or narcissistic relationships is. I don't know what to expect at all.\n\nHow have you experienced your first healthy relationship after the narcissistic abuse? How have you handled it?",

A part of my mind can‚Äôt help but think ‚Äúwhat are the chances I‚Äôm the only one who sees it? Maybe I am the problem?‚Äù\n\nBut she, SHE planted that seed in me too.\n\nIf I‚Äôm in a disagreement with someone I never feel the need to pin shit on them; I treat conflict like something to be solved together and learn from.

Under the guise of sweetness and understanding, she actually dismissed me and washed her hands of any role she played in my anxiety. Of course it‚Äôs up to me to manage my anxiety, but why am I being punished or scrutinized for feelings that come up for me?\n\nif you plan to get drunk and sleep over at a friend‚Äôs house where there is a girl actively trying to have sex with you, I‚Äôm unreasonable for being a little concerned..?

So these people made a fake account on socialmedia with my name on it and they text themselves, take screenshot and post to public to make it look like it was me who texted them, and make it look like I act the way they claim I do, they change the reality to make it seem like something it never was and they want to make me look like the bad guy and try to make me look desperate, obsessive, and in love with them and that I harass them. When they obsessed and harassed and clearly still are obsessed with me.\n\nThey used my identity to make the picture they are painting of me look legit.\n\nI feel sick, nobody understands my trauma so I cant get advice from people but only you.\n\nwho havent been victim of smear campaign and antisocial people. And Its too late to report to police on impersonation because\n\n1. I lost my screenshots where you can see my name on the fake account ( now they have deleted my name) but the account is left.\n\n2. It was last year, but at the time I decided to ignore it because I know the truth and that just confirms they are obsessed with me and they are crazy because they try to make it seem like I am obsessed and crazy. But its on my mind now and i regret not reporting, because when I deep it they share to many people, they know many people and they probably took my selfies and put on the fake account to \"expose\" me and be like \" this person is obsessed with me!!!\". They are lying about me and using my name anyhow like they know me when they ARE LITERALLY strangers that targeted me in school because they are obsessed with where I was from and this targeting started because of their hatred and discrimination towards me and my heritage. My heritage made me stand out to them, so not only was i a victim of antisocial dickheads but also a victim of discrimination/racism.\n\nThis is really getting to me and I came here to get advice , what can one do to accept the fact that a narcissist pretended to be the victim, and used the victims identity to contact themselves and make it look like it is the actual victim contacting them when that is really the narcissist/psychopath. And now they have destroyed the victims identity and made the victim look a certain way that is completely false?\n\nThey made a fake account 1,5 YEARS after no contact, so I feel like they will never stop harassing me and obsess with me. \n\nI can only share with other victims of antisocial behaviour.

But in the next two months  I was struggling so one night I added her on Instagram from a separate account in August. She didn't accept my add request until after Christmas when I suddenly received notification from Instagram that she accepted my request. All of a sudden I was looking at her new stories every week. By then I had started doing much better but since January I started feeling somewhat like crap again. Over the next two months it started getting worse. I felt so pathetic as a human being but I just couldn't unfollow her anymore.\n\nToday I finally grew the balls to unfollow her. I feel a weight has been lifted off my chest. I haven't told any of my friends about this because I was afraid they would chastise me for sliding back. Thought I'd share it with you guys. Yes...I feel sick for behaving like a loser.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/11g4nag/10_things_you_need_to_help_you_get_unstuck_plus_a/",
        "text": "  \n\nToday I want to talk about how to get unstuck from a Cluster B. First of all , if you are trying to get unstuck its hard and you should give yourself a pat on the back. These are a combination of tips , and mistakes we make that keep us stuck.\n\n1) First thing that I would say is study the pathology of Cluster Bs. Or CBs for short. Everyone uses the lingo. However , very people know what the lingo actually means. The following statement is a red flag, if you have used this or a variation of this than you do not know what a CB is. The statement , Why am I not enough ? If you really know the CB you will know the answer is you are not enough for the CB. But that is not on you but them. They get bored really easily and if you go off the script that they have in their mind, than in their eyes you are damaged goods. The hard cold truth is this, No one will ever be enough for the CB. That is because they are needy children emotionally, that is no way a reflection of you \n\n2) You do not know what real apology is, if the CB is like I am sorry , I love you. Most people tend to melt and be like okay, I forgive you . Than the cycle starts back up again. A real apology has to have action and pinpoint an action plan, Ex of a good apology, I am sorry I hit you , I have anger issues , this what I am doing to learn and grow. I am in counseling. \n\nExample of bad apology, I am sorry it did not work out, you are to good for me. Or you are to needy. This apology is bad because they are either playing the victim to make themselves feel better, or they are blameshifting . You may be needy . But the neediness comes from their conditioning, if they were not treating you inconsequent , than chances are you would not be so needy.\n\n3) Ties into number 1. Having ordered and reasonable expectations with a disordered person. When two healthy people break up you know the reason , why and having the closure talk is something that both people welcome. If someone is withholding closure , so they might have door way back , is that really in your best interest ?!When a healthy person and cluster B break up. Several things could happen and NONE of the options end well for you \n\na) You are replaced and ignored. \n\nb) You are bounced back and forth between another party , this is about control and the CB sense of control and entitlement , if you will not let me do X than I will go over here. \n\nc) You are gaslight and blameshifted that is all your fault. Seldom is it just one persons fault in a healthy relationship\n\n4) You have a hard time letting go that Mr or Mrs Charming that you meet in the beginning of the relationship is gone. The truth is you will see glimpses of that person just enough to keep you around\n\n5) Playing with your emotions, People for the most part are constient , you meet someone , you learn , you grow , you love. If your toxic person is like you are my soul mate , than next week , I hate you , week after that back to soul mate. That irregularity is about making you easier to control and manipulate. Nothing more , nothing less. \n\n6) RED FLAG on you , if you are doing the bulk of the work to maintain the relationship , they sure are not going to do any of the work to fix the relationship that would mean accountabity and shame, and guilt, CB do not do that. \n\n7) Healing needs to be about you , your pain. Not about them. Its okay to grieve the relationship , NOT okay to play the what if game that could slow down healing exponentially. \n\n8) Focus on who they are NOT who they pretended to be. The person that they pretended to be does not exist.\n\n9) Stop making excuses, A lot of times people make excuses for the CB. So they stay longer. This is dangerous because , you need to ask yourself how much time are you going to waste ? Unless they become self aware and work to improve themselves because THEY want to, not because you told them to the sad truth is this, you are wasting your time and energy. \n\n10) FINAL one, LEARN something about yourself , If you cant answer this question , fine but you proably will repeat a CB Relationship DO you have co depend issues, people please , poor boundaries, do the inner work. DO not worry about what they are doing, You will be replaced, However the odds are REALLY high that your replacement will be taking the journey you took sooner than later. FYI you will not know when because you do not know the new persons boundaries, or how complaint they are \n\nBONUS \n\nRelearn yourself, enjoy your life, take some time for you , learn self care. A lot of times when we leave CB relationships we have to figure out what is real vs what is projection from them or defense mechanism.",

He showed narcissistic tendencies early on (love bombing, future faking, mirroring). He also utilized some pickup artist techniques (remember those?), which leads me to wonder was he a narcissist or was something else going on?\n\nHis mask dropped about a month into dating, but I was hooked at that point. He was passive aggressive, used the silent treatment, and was digging to find out my insecurities. He also showed controlling tendencies like shushing me during a movie (while he talked the entire time) and made a point to say he would kiss me goodbye in his apartment (not by my car like he used to). He also told some stories that painted him out to be a pretty aggressive and toxic person. I put up a wall at that point and was not able to be myself around him, yet continued to date him for another couple months. He was so interesting and kept me on my toes. I also held onto hope that the guy from the beginning would come back, and he did at times. \n\nAt the end, I could not shake this feeling that he was trying to blackmail me or maybe even hurt me.

        "text": "Hey guys, just was hoping to get some advice. \n\nI got in a relationship with a guy who my phycologist believes to be a narcissist. This guy caught me at a very vulnerable time in my life, told me everything I wanted to hear and then destroyed and discarded me months latter. It was an extremely confusing time for me because this guy was extremely good to me until a few weeks prior to breaking up with me and it only got worse after the break up. \n\nIt‚Äôs been over 6 months since we broke up and I still can‚Äôt stop thinking about him.\nWe haven‚Äôt been in contact for almost 2 months now which is the longest it‚Äôs been and whilst I know this is the best for us, it still does hurt especially now that it feels final and I don‚Äôt think he will contact me ever again and I defiantly don‚Äôt want to contact him either. I‚Äôm not sure why it hurts so much after how he started to treat me and just coming to me for supply whenever he needed someone. \n\nI was hoping to get some advice on moving on from an emotionally abusive relationship and if anyone else has experienced this feeling of guilt for pulling away from a narc. There‚Äôs been many times where I‚Äôve even tried to ignore the abuse out of mind and look at the good things and question how we got in this position, but those thoughts never last long. \n\nWhilst I shouldn‚Äôt care what he does, I can‚Äôt help but feel sad of the thought of him moving on with his life and treating his next so much better then me.  \n\nI‚Äôm defiantly in a much better place now then what I was, but still frustrated that he has such an impact on my life still to this day and makes me fear getting in a logger relationship to be treated like this again. \n\n\nThanks :)",

You‚Äôre persistent, sometimes to your own demise. You view your time and energy as an investment and view walking away as a ‚Äúwaste‚Äù of your investment. \nIs this necessarily the truth? No, but it‚Äôs your truth. You‚Äôre hard on yourself. You stayed hoping things would improve the longer you held out, for reasons like 1. You really believed in them 2. Didn‚Äôt want to accept the truth because it felt like defeat 3. You loved them. \nYou also grew up thinking love and appreciation was something you always had to fight for. You grew up thinking one sided love and effort is normal. You convinced yourself there was no one out there better for you because you were comfortable settling with your current reality.\nAnd lastly? Abuse. Manipulation. They saw your value everyday and made it their mission to make sure you didn‚Äôt. They made you feel really good at first, only to then snatch the rug out from underneath your feet. Made you feel small everyday with attacks and criticism on your self esteem. \nThey got in your head and convinced you that you weren‚Äôt that special. Replaceable. That THEY were the prize. Made you feel like you couldn‚Äôt grow or prosper without them. \nOutside of abusive situations, we stay because we are taught it‚Äôs better to have somebody than nobody. We internalize this young. Prioritizing what we believe ‚Äúlove‚Äù to be. Feeling special or socially acceptable because we have a partner. That pressure makes people settle.\nIt makes them lose themselves. Makes them codependent. Makes them feel like they can‚Äôt go it alone. Well, you were different then. You valued different things then, that‚Äôs why you stayed. you had different beliefs. You‚Äôre awake now. You see relationships &amp; life for what it is.\nYou got wiser. Don‚Äôt feel ashamed for not knowing more. You were doing your best. Things are different now, be grateful. Be grateful you woke up. Your life isn‚Äôt over. There‚Äôs still so much more magic to create now that you‚Äôre free and mindful &amp; selective with your energy.\nIt takes everyone some time to find that real deep genuine self-love that keeps them from settling ever again. There‚Äôs so much unlearning and reprogramming to be done‚Ä¶ have patience. You‚Äôre getting there and that‚Äôs what matters. Look forward, not behind beloved. You‚Äôve got this.",

I always felt that he knew how to mess with and twist my mind in particularly nefarious ways.  \n\nSome of the things that are proving difficult to watch are; the cult leader making a big deal of about small things (a scratched pan). He would then blame others for doing it.  When the person told them that they didnt do it or didnt remember doing it, he would tell them he didn't believe them.  He would wear them down until they finally believed they did something wrong and would admit to the \"infraction.\" He also used sleep deprivation.  My NEx did all of that too. \n\nI want to watch the rest of the series because I always feel like there are things to be learned.  But, this is a tough one for me.  I'll probably have to spread out my viewings.\n\nThanks for the vent.",

At the age of 15 or so I realized (mostly from my older sister telling me how wrong all the treatment we had received was) that my parent (mother &amp; her abusive boyfriends) was treating me very poorly. After 15 or so I was just stonewalling daily but even that only got me so far. I still felt immense pain knowing I couldn't really be myself around them and the amount of screaming, throwing objects, I don't really want to think about it tbh.  \n\nAnyways I got a full time job at 18 and have been living by myself since basically December 2020. It's been almost 3 years and I still don't feel well. I am such a reserved person and I haven't made any real friends since I was a teenager. I always get ghosted by people and at this point I have stopped even caring about making friends in real life and just want to focus on myself. Is it normal to feel so reserved in your early 20s after being in an abusive situation for your entire life? Like I feel like I should care more about having friends and all that jazz but I just can't bring myself to care about social situations. I used to have alot of friends in high school but I moved far away from them all and now just don't give a crap. I feel like my body and mind just need away from people as a whole.",

        "text": "I‚Äôm 21 and I grew up in a narcissistic cult. I was my dad‚Äôs ‚Äúprecious little girl‚Äù (he was in love with me) and scapegoat.\n\nSo at 19, I get stuck at my grandparents because I spoke up about my dads abuse and he didn‚Äôt want me there anymore. Him and my grandparents have all controlled me together since I was a child and I was stuck and miserable. Nobody would help my my whole childhood and teen years because nobody would believe me‚Ä¶ Realized that my whole entire family are narcissists or something like that and are in a cult. Then came my savior‚Ä¶ an older woman who I fell instantly in love with. My grandparents started treating me worse and kicked me out. She told me to just go to her. She acted like she didn‚Äôt want me to stay at first but now I see that wasn‚Äôt really true. She started our relationship telling me so many amazing things about myself and I was on cloud 9. I didn‚Äôt see any of the red flags probably because none of it seemed too out of the ordinary for me with my past‚Ä¶\n\nShe started by telling me how into me she was, then saying she was too fucked up from her abusive exes to want to commit to me or be exclusive‚Ä¶ told me it was too early for that which it was, but I was living with her and we were acting like a couple every day and having sex. I thought she was crazy over me then she dropped the bomb that there was another girl she had been talking to on tinder that she met before me. I didn‚Äôt like that and I asked her to be exclusive with me while we were involved this way. She finally a bit later told me she really did want me but she was so scared. We became official and a few days later she told me one person might not be enough for her, that she might want several partners. Then, she let it be known that she still talks to her ex and kept telling me their messages and would never stop talking about her. She didn‚Äôt agree to block her for months and made me feel like shit for wanting her to. I fought and fought for her and we ended up in a serious relationship that now she says I forced her into. She got me fully dependent on her in every way especially financially. I thought things were perfect and planned to marry her for a year. Long story short, the relationship was horribly toxic but I believed every story she told me, I thought so just needed to be patient because of her past relationships and I made excuses every time to get myself to believe she loved me. \n\nI could write pages and pages but this is just a reddit post. I am so sad and broken. I exposed my dad recently and went no contact and started learning everything about narcissists. I‚Äôve had some moments before where I questioned her and tried to leave but she blackmailed or guilt tripped me into coming back. I realized all of this yesterday‚Ä¶ She listened to me telling her about all the abuse and my triggers and did those things on purpose. She told me to stop confusing her with my dad. Every time I questioned anything I was manipulated into believing I abused her and apologized. I literally got diagnosed with BPD and have been trying to ‚Äúbecome a better person‚Äù so I could be the best partner for her. I have been so confused about all the things she did to me (it would be a huge list) I lost touch of all reality. It‚Äôs a long story but things have been horrible and I thought it was all my fault or that I didn‚Äôt understand her enough. Also thought she was autistic lol‚Ä¶\n\nI came to this conclusion because the other night, she tried to triangulate me. My past trauma had been surfacing so much and I didn‚Äôt realize why until now. The triangulating brought me back to my dad when he would do that to me with my grandparents. She has made me think that I am so mentally unstable and messed up‚Ä¶ Last night it all hit me at once especially after i‚Äôve been feeling different for like a week after  she go even more violent with me than she ever had. When I realized I started violently shaking and freaking out. No idea how I convinced her to let me leave with a friend while I was crying like that and she didn‚Äôt question it. Now I‚Äôm here and all at once so suddenly I see everything and I feel so torn up, lost and used.\n\nAll of my stuff is still at her house including my cat. I am agonizing over how to deal with that. She is psychotic‚Ä¶ I witnessed her stalking her ex (not even the first one i mentioned but a whole other one) and still stayed with her like an idiot. I heard a lot of scary things from that ex when I contacted her once in one of my phases of questioning and trying to leave. She has been the same way to me. Regardless of all that stress, realizing that my darling, my baby girl, the one who has gotten me through all this with my family isn‚Äôt even real. After having to accept last month that my family was never real. Way too much. Four days ago I was trying to forget the previous incident because I love her so much and never want to leave her. Four days ago I was all over her like always and so happy to be with her. No matter how horribly she treated me, especially because i thought it was my fault. \n\nOvernight. Here I am in the home of an acquaintance I don‚Äôt know that well trying to figure out what do do with no money and never have been able to hold a job. I want the life back that I thought I had just a few days ago. I miss my baby girl, I love her with everything in me and I know it hurt the way I left. I had to trick her and she thought i‚Äôd be back in an hour. I want the sweet affectionate and loving lady of mine back that I fell asleep holding two days ago. I will never be able to do that again. I miss our home and our pets and everything we do together already. I could go back, but there‚Äôs no taking it back now after seeing so clearly. It‚Äôs gone. My life, the person I would have done anything with to be with forever. I have no one close to me and I‚Äôm so lonely and just want her to hold me and forget about everything I have realized. I hate sleeping without her and being alone with this pain all night. I wish my cat was here to sleep with me. I have never ever been so heartbroken and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Every single piece of me is breaking and painful.",

        "text": "  \n\nAre you unworthy or are you not enough? I have seen a lot of variations of those questions posted as well as , am I the toxic narcistic person . That is what I am going to talk about . First thing is this , you are worth, you not Toxic AF, and you are not the Narcastic person. And I have been guilty of thinking some of those. \n\nFirst I want to talk about , am I the toxic narc, This is the easiest question to answer so I am going to answer it first.\n\nTo be a ClusterB and NPD falls into that catergory you have to have no introspection what so ever. A person with NPD is not going to think to ask that question , (TW I am talking about unaware , aware NPD is totally different thing). An unaware NPD , is either going to deflect, I am the narc you are, or they are going to rage out, or they are going to ignore you and possibly leave you. Another thing , unaware NPD will not have enough self awareness to ask the question. \n\nAlso people get Toxic and reactive abuse mixed up. If you have enough of the gaslighting , cheating, lying , and abuse, and you start acting like them, You are not them and there is a difference. There are doing their toxic behavior to control you , and get the outcome that they want. You are doing your as a coping and defense mechanism. You would not be doing yours , if they were showing you love and respect on a regular basis. \n\nAnother reason why people are upset when they do reactive abuse, is because it usually is swift, and explodes like a bomb. This is your bodys way of built in defense from the abuse you suffered. \n\nAre you enough are you unworthy those are trickier statements. Empathetic people are super sensitive. First you are worthy and you are enough. Some times these feelings are projected from the NPD, You get a little glimpse of Mr or Mrs Charming they disappear and become monsters, When Mr or Mrs Charming disappears , you internalize it as a personal failure, maybe if I was this or maybe if I did this than Prince or Princess Charming would return. This kind of thinking leads us to getting more abused. And opens us up to things that we would never think about , Ie third party relationships . Third party can be sharing or back and forth. We blame everyone involved the other party , ourselves but we never blame the person that started it for fear that PC(short for Prince or Princess Charming ) will go somewhere else. \n\nWe also make the mistake of not recognizing that PC being with held from us is NOT a personal failure on our part, also if PC withholds affection , information, decent behavior , etc. People do not realize that PC is an illusion to get attention, validation , and reaction from you. They cant maintain the PC fa√ßade , this it is why people see less of PC and more of the monster. \n\nTrauma Bonds are designed to make you feel unworthy and doubt yourself. A lot people say I do not have no Trauma bond , I am fine. You can post whatever you want, However if you post conflicting posts, I will give an example and why of it is bad, you are still in the trauma bond and may need professional help to get out. \n\nExample of Conflicting post. \n\nMy Ex is a serial cheater, he beat me. Last week his son got sick , and he did not tell me, I love him so much. I know he is no good , But maybe If I give him more sex or apologize he will go back to being that wonderful man. I only block him on certain things. Eventually I am hoping he comes around.\n\nWhat is wrong with this post . \n\nPoster is not recognizing, Ex pathology. Cheating , physical abuse, and gaslighting, Ie withholding information about someone. Pathology like this will not change without therapy, Untreated these pathologies will proably get worst. \n\nPoster is doing double duty, taking all the blame of why relationship went south and false hope of fixing it by themselves.\n\nRelationships take two people Not one, if one person is doing all the work and the other person is like what can I get from you , you want me to change to make you better and stop abusing you , No thanks I am good it works for me. Massive Red flag.\n\nPartial blocking, and hoping for future , without them putting in the work , with you , it will not end well for you. \n\nUntil they GET help, it is unwise and foolish to live on false hope, Because you can be reabuse and retraumatized.",

It was a tough pill to swallow at first, but over the years of finally seeing it, I mourned that we would never have a mother/daughter relationship that could be healthy.\n\nI had a major brain surgery on 1/25 to remove a tumor from my brain and neck. She was not present, and the person who was my medical Champion was updating everyone during my 17 hour surgery. My mother ran a Facebook group to update everyone, and was reaching out to friends to see if they had heard anything, and complaining that updates were few and far between. Updates came every 3-4 hours, between three surgeons working to save my life.\n\nSurgery started Wednesday Morning, and ended Thursday Morning. I was placed on a ventilator to rest and recover for another day. My mother was upset that I didn‚Äôt contact her until Friday, and then upset that I didn‚Äôt want to FaceTime. I had a feeding tube, drains, and didn‚Äôt really feel like talking.\n\nFast forward to now, she‚Äôs having a major surgery on her heart in a few weeks.

I was made to feel guilty tonight that I can‚Äôt reschedule my appointment to attend hers, as if I don‚Äôt care about her well being. I do care, she‚Äôs my mom, but my appointment was scheduled prior to leaving my week long stay at the hospital.\n\nWe had minimal contact prior to me finding out I needed another surgery, and I think it‚Äôs time to reduce contact again. It‚Äôs carrying more stress than I can handle right now.\n\nSorry, just needed to vent.",

        "text": " 1. Your narc KNOWS what they are doing is bad. The fact that they can keep a mask on outside while carrying out abuse behind closed doors shows that they are perfectly capable of distinguishing the two behaviors. They also wouldn't love-bomb you if they couldn't distinguish. They choose to do the former bc they want to.\n\n2. Your narc does not WANT to see you succeed. This might be tough to swallow at first, but, have you noticed that the glass ceiling is always being raised higher? Even then, when they stir up chaos, drama, and hurt you (knowing perfectly well what they are doing) and try to \"control you\" in ways that actually backfire, doesn't it actually cause you fail? If you are with a  malignant narcissist, chances are, they are probably doing that on purpose to sabotage you. Nothing feeds a malignant narc's sadism more than seeing you \"try to do well\" to win their love/approval and then sabotaging you so that you \"fail\" to do so. Your emotional pain gives them narcissistic supply. If you reveal a passion to them, chances are, they WILL sabotage it. Again, nothing gives a malig narc more sadistic joy than to steal your joy.\n\n3. The last tough pill to swallow is that when they argue, they aren't actually trying to reach a resolution with you. Normal, healthy ppl argue to reach a resolution. However, for a malig narc, what they're looking for is chaos and drama. Seeing you emotionally dysregulated gives them narcissistic supply.\n\nThis was tough for me to swallow, as someone raised by a single malig narc mom, with generational abuse and a malig narc family on her entire side (money squandering, drinking issues, etc) and a borderline + sociopathic cousin (who literally committed a crime before). But you realize that they won't change and simply chose to be this way. You don't fall for them playing victim, if you know that they are AWARE of what they are doing. If you know this, you would LEAVE instead of \"working it out\".\n\nI still believe that there's more good in the world, and I was just \"raised\" by bad people. But I am slowly learning how to love and be my true authentic self, and not accepting any less from others. Surrounding myself with healthy ppl who love me for who I am, instead of continuing the cycle and attracting abusers who feel familiar to me.",

After that, the stalking and attacks began.\nAt first it was her stalking me from room to room, literally at any time I was in the house, beginning from the time I got up in the morning. I tested it out many times as I could not understand why a person would engage in such an activity or consider it worth their time. She used to engage in extreme passive aggressive activities such as slamming doors, throwing things on the floor or screeching chairs or other such things to make her point‚Ä¶this began from the day I moved in.\nIt has now progressed to the point where she has had someone take pictures of me, has people follow me around at the places I go to (gym and coffee house) and to continually stalk me around the house with her. She‚Äôs obsessed to the point of absurdity and what I would view as harm to herself. It‚Äôs amazing to me the amount of people she‚Äôs involved, including neighbours and what appears to be members of a spiritual church, cult or literal gang stalking organization.  I don‚Äôt know how many people actually understand that she is a covert narcissist, however i would be suprised if this did not occur to at least some of her flying monkeys‚Ä¶in any case, they are all complicit.\nI am wondering if anyone here has any advice for the interim? After her long campaign of abuse and harassment, my neighbour has realized I will not be moving and will herself be leaving as of march 31. Literally she may be the worst human I‚Äôve ever met..,just focusing on my mental health for the time being and trying to block her out but I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback.\n‚úåÔ∏èthanks all üåàüíï",

They purposely got exposed to COVID by my Naunt to prevent this. I masked up and waited at my nephew's mother's door for 20 minutes in the freezing cold, knocking. She never arrived to the door. I left the gifts. The *second* I left, she messaged me thanking me for them. I took that as a message that I am not welcome except as a gift delivery service, I am not allowed to see the kids, so I backed of and haven't given them anything since.\n\nA few days back, I realized I haven't seen content about my nephews on Facebook lately and went to go to their mother's page. Turns out, I was unfriended and on January 25th, she posted a paragraph-long rant aimed at people who never reach out about her kids and think that the only contribution to their lives is liking stuff on Facebook and how it makes her sick. This was very clearly aimed at me. I could tell because I went up to Rhode Island in January for a few days and posted my going back home photo on 1/23 and she unfriended me and posted that paragraph on 1/25.\n\nAnd, just like that, I'm done. You *cannot* send me a very clear message saying \"you're not welcome here\" and then expect me to reach out all the fucking time. I *do* care about those kids. I refuse to be that family member that only exists through gifts twice a year, but whenever they ask \"why does aunt Switched never talk to us\" she can spin a stupid answer or whatever she says. I really couldn't care less.\n\nThe responsibility of reaching out \"because *ffaaaaaammmmmmiiiiiillllllly*\" needs to get the fuck off me. We're turning 30 years old, she's been pulling this kind of vaguebook bullshit her entire life. I don't know if my dumbass Nparents did something to piss her off, if she's specifically upset I never reached out when I was up there, or what (communication is a hell of a skill, people!) I kinda can't care. My Nfamily and I are ***NOT*** a package deal.\n\nI blocked her and her friend who was also friends with me on Facebook and that's it. I'm done. Goodbye.",

This last month has been emotionally rough and unstable for me due to his constant mood swings and random outbursts, and always walking on eggshells. \n\nFirst it was good, like a dream come true, like a fairy tale. But now I see how he is. My friend warned me about him before. That he was a Narcissist. But I tried to overlook because I liked him. \n\nI haven't talked nor heard from him for 5 days now. First few days was hard for me since I really liked him.. communication slowly decreased with him,  but being surrounded by healthy people who care about me helps me feel positive vibes. I tried to heal our relationship but its better to distance myself from now on. \n\nI felt drained with him and didn't get the same amount of support unlike how I gave to him. It was all about him. Talked about him, his feelings, his goals, etc... Just about him. I never had the chance to open up fully because I never felt like he was interested. And I only talked long for one time and he didn't like it and used it against me. \n\nHe told me he just wanted me to shut up and listen and do what he tells me. \"Shut up shut up. I dont want to hear. You're too sentimental. You're a listener so you just listen. I dont want you to talk, I dont want you to think. I just want you to listen.\" I cried that time and begged to fix it. I stooped low. \nThen he apologized the next day like it was nothing. He didn't even care how I felt about it and he just kept on talking about his delusions like being on top, being the richest, etc...And he didn't like that I have bad days because it's not good for him. Always him. He even got mad that I had a bad dream, something I couldn't control, and asked me if a could dream of something positive that is relating to his future \"success\" or whatever he is trying to do. And he didn't want to hear that I was sad because my dog got sick. It says its affecting his energy. \n\nIt's so draining and lonely. \n\nNow its been days. Last message from him was him asking if we could talk. I told him I was busy. But I didn't want to hear any more of his grand dreams and grand goals. \nHe never messaged me after. \nI didn't bother messaging him anymore. \nI didn't bother being that supportive girl for him. I didn't bother boosting his ego anymore. \n\nI need my energy and positivity back. \nIm getting myself back. \nIm starting to feel like my old self. Free and positive and happy within. \n\nUnlike him, he is never happy with himself or what he does. He tries but he just doesn't get it. \n\nIm doing well. I'm proud of working it out by myself right now. I'm proud of protecting my heart and mind from people who drain my soul. \n\nI'm just sharing. \nI still feel bad and miss him but I deserve a healthy relationship, and he cannot give me that. I tried communicating but its like talking to a wall. \nHis energy is just draining me. It's so toxic. \nIm better off not hearing his constant complaints, his delusions of grandeur, and his ego. \n\n3-4 months of my time and energy and love wasted but I've learned how to be stronger in protecting myself. \n\nIm better off with just me right now without constantly walking on eggshells. \n\nIm doing well in healing on my own without this emotional vampire. \n\nCongratulations to me.",

The subtle underhanded criticisms, insults - things so small that you question if your reaction to them is even justified. Not too small though. Just small enough.

I know narcissists are expert manipulators and they go in your head, but trust me. You know what you are doing. \nEnablers and other people still in contact with the narcissist want you to explain why. They want you to do this because they want to judge and evaluate if you're right to do it, because they don't want you to go NC for personal reasons. Don't listen to them. You do not have to prove your trauma to anyone. You don't have to give them scientific, mesurable, exact situations that will trigger you over and over again just so they can be convinced. You do not have to convince anyone. You do what's the best for you. You know what is best for you. Don't listen to people that are not in your place and want to be a victim according to their own definition. Whatever happened, whatever how small, how big, how insignificant or serious it was, you did the right thing for yourself, by putting your mental health and yourself first.\nYou do not own anything to anyone. No explanations, no descriptions, no examples. Trust yourself. You did the right thing.",

        "text": "I dated my ex for 11 months, and currently 2 weeks out of relationships. I sort of knew from the beginning what I was signing up for, since he opened to me about his BPD mom's abuse, so I assumed that he might have some BPD tendencies. Later, after being pushed away, hoovered back, verbally and emotionally abused, I learned more about NPD. Needless to say, I believed that love could overcome everything, but in the end, he broke up with me for being not supportive enough.\n\nAnyway, 1 week after the breakup, one morning I felt as if I had awoken from a fever dream. I literally could not remember clearly the events of the last year. I know that I used to love our sex, and thought that it was the best thing ever, but I can't remember how it went now. I look at photos, and have flashback-like memories, but not a clear timeline. I believe it was because of constant cognitive dissonance, and that I was gradually becoming more and more tense and scared of both losing him and staying with him. It was easier to \"forget\"/ \"erase\" an instant of emotional abuse from my memory rather than try to argue and stand your ground, because by the end of the argument he most likely would just break up with me. \n\nAnd that left me wondering, if the narcissists are constantly living in this kind of dissonance/dissociation/FOG state (for instance, in my ex's case caused by severe abuse by his mother in childhood), that's why they can discard people so easy - they don't have clear memories of events. They gaslight, because they cannot see the objective reality. They basically can never ever leave this fever dream. What do you think?",

        "text": "Let me preface this by saying that while I realize I am still getting through the trauma bond, I am NOT willing to take back my ex narc. I‚Äôm simply curious. Part of me wants her new relationship to fail, and for her to come crawling back, just so I can reject her. I know it‚Äôs petty but let me have my fantasies. Anyway, I know that everyone is different and no one can know for sure, but I was hoping someone here might be able to tell if they think this discard is permanent, if the new supply will last, and if not, then maybe I can get an estimate on how long until I can expect before she might try to get me back. I‚Äôve seen just as many articles online that claim she could be back within months as I have seen ones that claim she will never return and I just want to know which sounds more likely.\n\nMy ex seems like a covert narcissist, very vulnerable and validation seeking. She became unhappy over the past year because I started holding her accountable for certain things. Up until this point I have been like her servant but we never argued or had any issues. She then formed a relationship with a coworker that just started at her job in December, and when I caught her texting him and discovered the affair, she left me for him. She said she is in love with him. She said she loves me too but it hasn‚Äôt been the same in a long time. She has moved in with him as of now. DDay was 2 weeks ago. Initially I lined for her and begged her to come back, but that only lasted a few days. Since that time I have accepted it and even have been completely understanding of her. I packed her things for her, told her that I forgive her and that I hope she will be happy. Since then I have been working on myself, which she has already noticed (going to the gym, having fun with friends, working on bettering my career).\n\nThere are some factors that make me think she is truly done with me and that I should never expect a hoover.\n\n1. She seems to really, really like this guy. Her text messages called him her soulmate, after knowing him for less that 2 months. He has a better body than me and apparently has so much in common with my ex.\n2. She told me blatantly that her feelings on me had been changing for a while and they never came back, though she still loves me in some way.\n3. I challenged her for the last few months on her behavior and the suspicions I had about her infidelity which were completely accurate. She believes this was mental abuse.\n4. I called her out for being a possible narcissist during the breakup.\n5. She lasted with me for nearly 15 years, so she obviously doesn‚Äôt have a problem staying with someone long term as long as it‚Äôs working.\n6. She is extremely prideful and might not try to come back even if she wanted to. Or she may believe that our situation is unsalvageable.\n7. She has been in minimal contact since the breakup, only texting me to discuss picking up her stuff, etc.\n\nThere are also a number of factors that make me think that she might not last long with this new guy, but I have no idea if these factors really mean much. I will list them here anyway.\n\n1. We lasted for almost a decade and a half without any issues. If she was devaluing me during this time I never noticed. I was her first boyfriend and lover (and yes I do know this for a fact).\n2. She doesn‚Äôt seem like a typical covert  narcissist, and possibly has a lot of BPD traits along with NPD. For instance, she is never mean on purpose, even during the breakup, and seems to genuinely show empathy in some cases. She seems as heartbroken as I am about all this and has been nothing but apologetic.\n3. The new supply is also a cheater and left his family for her. The ex and I don‚Äôt have kids but the new supply has several.\n4. They are dirt poor. They moved into a crappy apartment in the middle of nowhere and combined they make less than half of what I make alone. The financial struggles will be very real.\n5. She doesn‚Äôt drive and will depend on him for transportation everywhere.\n6. They work together and now they live together. They will be spending 100% of their time together from now on after barely getting to know each other.\n7. Her family and friends have shunned her. Everyone around her knows that she is in the wrong and I know for a fact that she is wracked with guilt.\n8. She has purposefully kept her rings and sentimental items, even the ones I asked for her to give back. She keeps making excuses for not finding them.\n9. After moving out she keeps remembering things she forgot and keeps wanting to come back to grab something that she left behind.\n10. The last time she was here she looked like she was going to cry. I got the distinct feeling that the grass wasn‚Äôt greener after all, but she stuck to her guns anyway. She did tell me how sorry she was that it happened this way, however.\n11. She had a good life with me and I provided everything she could ever want. She is definitely going through a bit of a shock with the drastic change in her environment and quality of life.\n12. She doesn‚Äôt have anyone else. She‚Äôs far, far away from her family. Doesn‚Äôt drive. Can‚Äôt live on her own. If the new guy goes south, she will have no options other than me, unless she finds a newer supply. \n13. She has no other real ex-supply‚Äôs other than a couple of online interactions with people very far away. I realized that she has always been scoping out new possibilities, as is the nature of a narcissist, but I can genuinely say that she has never gone as far as she has with this new guy before. When everything came out I went through all her shit and found some very old evidence but it never seemed to go anywhere for her.\n14. I am nearly positive that she is lying about this, but she still claims that she never got physical with him while we were still together. She even said they still hadn‚Äôt when she had moved out for the first week. I find this totally unbelievable but at the same time, why lie about this? She openly admitted everything else when I found the ‚Äúemotional affair‚Äù. The only reason I can think of is that she knows I would never take her back if so. I‚Äôve said as much in the past that physical cheating is something I could never come back from. \n15. I have a sneaking suspicion that the new supply isn‚Äôt an empath, but a narcissist himself. \n\nAlright so, that was a lot, but I just wanted to get all the facts out and see what y‚Äôall think based on this. I really just want to know what the odds are of her trying to come back or her new relationship blowing up fast. Either way would be cathartic for me.",

        "text": "My narc and I have been involved on/off for 3 years. Essentially, every time we are \"off\", it is when I'm getting ignored/stonewalled/silent treatment whatever you want to call it for attempting to hold him accountable for his sh\\*tty behavior in any way. The absolute *second* I call attention to any shady behavior, I'm \"dramatic\" and \"doing too much\" and \"causing unnecessary drama\". Any then I'm dropped almost immediately. He used to go back and forth with me, but now it's instant stonewalling. The last time this happened we went 8 months without speaking, after a huge blowout. I was absolutely certain we would never speak again. Then he came back into the picture, extremely randomly, about 4-5 months ago. Over that 8 months, I really started to heal. I foolishly let him back in when he came back a few months ago. I wish I never did. Because now, after a brief 4-5 month stint of entangling with him, we're back to instantaneous stonewalling because I called him out for something objectively sh\\*tty. We haven't spoken in a month.\n\nI so badly want to be free of this person. I have spent the last 3 weeks feeling actually at peace because of his absence, but this week I'm struggling. I hate how he treats me. Like I'm disposable. Like I'm an option. Like he doesn't care about me at all. \n\nAnd the thing is, I know that is exactly what I am to him. Supply. Supply that has been around long enough that his tricks don't work on me anymore, and my tolerance for his BS is essentially nonexistent. His mask fell off a long time ago. I know exactly who he is, and he knows it. And I think that's why I'm not \"top quality\" supply in his mind anymore....I know the pattern all too well, and I no longer see him as misunderstood, gentle, kind, or anything of the sort.\n\nI know he is terrible. I know he doesn't care about me...but I am attached. And gosh, I so badly want to be free from his shackles. I feel all the time like I am getting closer and closer to it.\n\nI have fallen into his trap over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. And he knows it. He knows he can treat me like sh\\*t and I'll still let him back in.\n\nI am moving across the country in 4 months. He knows this. I'm certain he'll come back. There's no way in hell I'll leave the state without him trying to weasel his way back in at least once more. I want to be strong enough to turn him down. This period of no-contact has really reinforced for me that my attachment towards him is nothing more than an addiction. I have no respect for him, I want him gone for good, yet I crave him so badly sometimes that my chest physically aches. \n\nI'm so tired of this hell.",
