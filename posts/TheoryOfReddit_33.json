        "text": "Conan's popular Youtube account, Team Coco, put out a new video today of their awkward, metrosexual associate producer \"Jordan Schlansky\" reviewing his Norelco body grooming device with Conan's signature deriding of him. It's a funny video, but why do I get the feeling bot manipulation is being used in both the submission, the upvotes, and the comments on reddit? Take a look at this comment section:\n\nArchive: http://archive.is/2XrTr\n\nOriginal: https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4bl9q8/jordan_schlanskys_product_review_philips_norelco/\n\nNot only are almost all of the comments lifted straight from YouTube's top comments, but one particular comment: \n\n&gt; \"Schlansky almost lose it at 2:36 lol\"\n\nWas posted 7 times by various reddit accounts, all of them many years old. Some of those accounts are even moderators of other subreddits. Also, that particular comment was upvoted about 6 times each. Here's a screenshot from earlier in the day when that was the top five comments, all identical. Notice the upvote scores:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LQUwz8M.png\n\nHow is this even possible? Are all of these accounts fake? Or are they real accounts that have been compromised? Are they all people who work in Conan's office? Or do people sell their Reddit accounts to marketers? There's no way 7 different people made that same weird YouTube comment. The \"2:36\" is a timestamp to a particular spot in the YouTube video, which when posted in the Youtube comment section works as a clickable link. But here on reddit, it does not link to that particular moment. So there's really no reason that popular YouTube comment should be on Reddit, much less upvoted, and yet it is.\n\nAnother top comment, which says:\n\n&gt;\"So Jordan Schlansky is the PE/\\KE of Team Coco.\"\n\nThat's currently the top rated comment on YouTube as seen by this screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/f2ANwZr.png because the person posting it is a popular YouTuber and his followers and supporters \"liked it\" it on YouTube. And yet, here it is on Reddit for some reason, from a totally unrelated account, most likely a bot, with a bunch of upvotes. Why? How?\n\nThe only reason I'm able to point this out is because this particular video didn't do that well on r/videos. So normally this initial boost of upvotes would not be visible once it made the front page and all of the top comments would be replaced by genuine ones. Whenever popular YouTube channels like h3h3productions, Team Coco, etc. make the front page of Reddit, did they get an initial boost from bot manipulation like this? Whereas, when you and I post a video on r/videos, no matter how good it is, it seems stuck in r/new and never gains more than one or two karma. Do you need bot manipulation in order to have a fighting chance of getting on the front page of default subreddits these days? And why does it seem like every single popular YouTuber who makes the front page of Reddit is utilizing this boost? \n\n",

        "text": "Hi there. So, I was listening to a recent episode of [The Hidden Brain podcast](http://www.npr.org/2016/03/14/470416797/even-astronauts-get-the-blues-or-why-boredom-drives-us-nuts) and they touched on an interesting subject: Boredom, and how it affects in-group/out-group perception and activity.\n\nAccording to[ a study by Wijnand A. P. van Tilburg](http://psp.sagepub.com/content/37/12/1679), who has a thing for studying how boredom affects the psyche, people who feel bored experience that their current situation is meaningless and are motivated to reestablish a sense of meaningfulness. This leads people to act out in ways that increase the disparity between ingroup and outgroup. For example:\n\nResearchers asked a group of Irish people to consider one of two hypothetical cases: 1) an Irishman beats up an Englishman or 2) an Englishman beats up an Irishman. They made some of the participants bored (by making them trace spirals on a piece of paper) before asking them to play judge. \n\nThey found that the bored volunteers assigned much longer jail sentences to the English villain and much shorter sentences to the Irish villain, and the non-bored volunteers assigned much shorter sentences to both.\n\nThis suggests that boredom encourages ingroup/outgroup, exclusionary behavior.\n\n\nMy theory is simple: People are on Reddit because they're bored. Therefore, they are more likely to try to make things more meaningful than they actually are by [generalizing entire groups of people](/r/european), or [trolling/agitating](/r/The_Donald), engaging in [ingroup/outgroup behavior](/r/shitredditsays), or [organizing themselves](/r/sandersforpresident) into action groups. They will also seek ingroup approval by, for example, submitting sympathetic posts like pictures of their dead dogs or /r/pics or pictures of their grandparents to /r/oldschoolcool etc. \n\nIt all stems from boredom and the unconscious/involuntary urge to make their lives more meaningful than they actually are. Redditors have no control over this. It's hard-wired into our brains.",

I have only been on reddit for 6 months, yet I am ranked 15th, while the top ranked person has 3,647 views, with this score being 6 times more than the 2nd ranked user and as such a quite random and strange figure, when compared to the rest. lI have come up with 4 different ways I think it is calculated but I am unsure which is correct. \n\n1) I thought that anyone could just search their username and it would count to number of times searched for but then I realised I have looked myself up way more times than the number in that category suggests, so I doubt that can be it.\n\n2) Does it work by IP address. So only one IP address could be added to the list? So even if 5 logged into 5 different accounts at the time I searched the same username on the same IP address, it would only count as 1.\n\n3) What account is logged into reddit at the time the username is searched? So even if 10 different accounts were using the same IP adress, as long as they were logged in separately when the same account was searched, that would add to the list.\n\n4) Same account, different IP address. So would logging into reddit at home, university, work computer, friends house etc count as 1 or in this scenario 4 searches?\nHope that made sense. \n\nCheers",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/4b4v4b/reposts_vs_new_posts_frontpage_visiblity/",
        "text": "Premise\n\nThe thought is, that one day in the future, if it hasn't happened already, is that the frontpage will be only reposts made up of non-time sensitive content (ie. not news, or time relevant posts).  New posts will have to compete for visibility with many many old posts, which makes new posts difficult to reach the audience they should have (unless they become reposts, which may or may not credit the original post).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA few terms:\n\n* Popular: people have seen it but like it so much they upvote it again, or people haven't seen it and like it so they upvote it, or people have seen it and don't like it or don't like reposts so they downvote it, or it gets downvoted by natural downvote methods (malevolent users, bots, etc.)\n* Time sensitive content: can be posted at any time of the day/week/month/year and still be considered relevant to the present.  News for example is typically time sensitive relating to the past day/week/month, but a meme about news can occur years after the actual event occurred, so the meme would be considered time insensitive.\n* New content: anything that hasn't been posted on reddit before.  This can include content posted to other sites, so long as it never has been shown on reddit.\n* Repost / old content: anything that has been posted to reddit regardless if the previous new content posted was popular or not.\n* Karma/upvote harvesting: the repost content doesn't matter.  The only thing that matters is the karma/upvotes.  The thought is that the vast majority of people who repost, don't repost so others can see the content, they do it so they can get karma/upvotes.  If people cared about reposting original content, then they'd indicate reposts as reposts and link to the original creator/post, and that rarely happens (but does happen).\n* Marketing accounts: used to spread their clients business through multiple accounts (not necessarily \"bots\", but people using different accounts for submissions and comments).  When such an account has been on reddit for a while and has numerous submissions/posts, it looks less like a \"marketing account\" and more like a real person.  You can sell your account to these companies which typically buy based on history length, karma count and time on reddit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhy?\n\nIf reposted content is popular enough to garner enough upvotes/karma, then it will be reposted to harvest the upvotes/karma.  This mentality or desire to gather upvotes/karma could have multiple factors, but I think the two biggest are a person feeling respected/popular in a social community, and the second being a person wanting to sell an account (higher post/karma = higher account worth), which means marketing companies have \"real accounts\" versus \"bot accounts\" to post their content with.\n\nIf we consider any new content being able to be converted to repost content and that repost content can be posted an over and over until it loses its popularity.  For every 1 piece of new content, you will have at least 1 repost but likely are to have more than 1 repost as time passes, such that repost content will always be available, and will quickly outgrow new content.\n\nIe. If we consider a period of time in which we have x new content posts.  These posts are all popular and are to be reposted in the future.  Each of these posts is then reposted so long as the previous repost was popular.  Therefore, x new posts turns into x+n reposts, where n is the number of times a repost is posted.  Eventually, there will be more reposts in circulation than new posts, as each new post will generate n reposts.\n\nHowever reposts aren't post all on the same day and are spread out over days/weeks/months, but will continue to gather popularity and continue to make it to the frontpage.  This allows new posts a chance to break the \"repost popularity barrier\" and appear on the frontpage.  If this occurs, then it adds significantly to the future repost count.  Some reposts are of content that wasn't as popular (not frontpage content) but gained popularity by reposting.  If we add this less-popular reposting content to the count, then you end up with 4 tiers:\n\n* Popular, reposted content: the upper class of reposts\n* Less popular, reposted content: the lower class of reposts\n* Popular, new content: the upper class of new posts\n* Less popular, new content: the lower class of new posts\n\nSince new content can only occur once, and reposts can occur numerous times, given any instantaneous point in time, you will have more reposts than new posts, so even the least popular repost has a chance at being more popular than the most popular new post due to the amount of visibility it has received.\n\nA new post only has a small time range to be seen and voted upon, but a repost has all the previous times it has been posted to be seen, and those people see it again and upvote it because they like it (or want others to see it too).  This means even the lowest class repost can gain more views/upvotes than the highest class new post.\n\nWe may not have seen the day where the above methodology occurs, but I believe it will occur in the future once the amount of reposts reaches a maximum peak of popular for each day.  If we say this peaks at y reposts per day, where y could be &gt;1000 different reposts, then x new posts will have to compete with y reposts for visibility.\n\nEventually, the frontpage will be unreachable for new posts because reposts will always be visible and will continue to gain votes.  The only \"frontpage\" new posts might see are on popular subs, which as mentioned above, will just contribute to the reposts on the frontpage.\n\nOvertime, reposts will lose popularity (as society/thoughts change on a subject), but lost reposts will just move to the bottom of the \"repost popularity stack\", making room for new popular repost content to take there place.\n\nA great example is humans on Earth.  We have seen the population grow because births are greater than deaths.  This will continue until we run out of resources to support the growth, which will then stagnant or decrease, but likely just plateau at some level.\n\nReposts are very similar as the amount of reposts in circulation is based on visibility and popularity on the frontpage.  While it could be possible for the frontpage to change every second with new upvoted reposts, it is unlikely to change much, so the visibility of a post on the frontpage is limited to the time decay of reddit's visibility algorithm.  Thus there is a theoretical limit on how many posts will reach the front page given at range of time.  Soooo reposts will reach a plateau of growth, limited by reddit itself.  Reposts will lose popularity overtime and will be replaced with new popular posts.  Just like someone that is old age will die, but is replaced with a new baby human... rinse/repeat.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nConclusion/TL;DR: In the future, the frontpage will only be reposts as the content they represent will continue to gather many upvotes which allows them to be reposted, and repeat until they are no longer popular, and replaced with a new repost that is popular.  New content will have a difficult time reaching the frontpage if reposts are continually being upvoted (thus the ratio of new posts to reposts will be really low, ie. 1:1000).\n\nSolution: Reddit checks their database to see if content has been reposted, based on some sort of score system, which relates to the popularity of previous posts and grades new reposts depending on their time/popularity on reddit.  So reposts are limited from being displayed on the frontpage if their score reaches a threshold, and are only shown on the sub they are posted in.  Thus new content isn't competing against continuously repeated old content for visibility.",

She would respond instantly if she only knew, but there is no way for her to know!  So now I must wait until she happens back. Forty more minutes pass before she does. She is now less enthusiastic and attentive too, but she clarifies with an answer.  But the situation returns to that previous state.  I don't know. Less interested with mind now on something else I return after two hours. My answer is much shorter, using less effort than would have been otherwise. Any follow up is hampered by the same problems...\n\nWhy on Earth does Reddit want to see us play this game?! I feel like it's likely to be intentional, because it would be easy to implement (well who knows on this scale, but the functionality is easy to build). \n\nIf you know or can speculate as to reasons why there are no email notifications (or even ajax notifications on a static page) please weigh in.

Whereas in the spirit of what reddit is about, I'd like to be able talk to people who think or believe differently than I do. When I take the time to write my comments, I want actual feedback, and assume the same of others. Wow, maybe one or both of us would learn something from a genuine exchange.\n\nAnonymous downvotes primarily serve the site's interest in algorithmic efficiency: there's a vested interest in making controversial or marginal views just disappear, instead of engaging social resources available to work through disagreements. That's a huge downside. Downvotes aren't supposed to be a popularity contest.\n\nOne might at first glance that anonymous downvotes provide a safe way for people to provide dissent, or something like that. It's a false argument, because legitimate dissent actually needs to express something and engage with the other.\n\nAn option for non-anonymous votes in subs might encourage better social accountability for users' choices. Just speaking hypothetically.\n\nThese are just a few issues that's occurred to me, that are preliminary and written down quickly as an argument, so please take my expressions with a grain of salt. I wanted to articulate a usage pattern that's bothered me for a while; my \"wish\" is not a literal wish! Please discuss!",

That's a broader definition that most, but I think there's a lot of overlap.\n\nMany unsavoury subreddits have popped up in the history of Reddit, including /r/creepshots, /r/jailbait, /r/thefappening. They attracted a larger userbase to Reddit, and I have a theory that there's overlap between the users who came for creepshots, jailbait and leaked celebrity nudes, and the kind of people you see on /r/fatpeoplehate, Voat, /r/the_donald and even /r/roastme. Some are hateful, some go on about safe spaces and SJWs, some are extremely politically right wing, and some are all three!\n\nAnother subreddit that I think attracted a lot of right-wingers is /r/cfb. College football is big in red states, and particularly rural areas of red states. In addition, BYU and Notre Dame are notoriously conservative schools. It doesn't sound farfetched to me that political conservatives came to Reddit through /r/cfb, and may have helped with the rise of /r/conservative and the \"reactionary right\".\n\nAnother alternative was the rise of KiA and TiA, where it was about ethics in game journalism. In fact, it could be that political conservatives came to Reddit through one of the unsavoury subreddits (or /r/cfb), but then developed more extreme political views due to exposure to KiA and TiA.\n\nWhat do you think?",

The mods responded that they couldn't and/or wouldn't implement my suggestions, so I've been playing around with RES trying to figure something out. \n\nI turned \"hard ignore\" on, which filters out all posts from users on your ignore list. I then ignored everyone who submitted a heavily pro-Sanders or anti-Clinton links, in addition to filtering out the Salon, Huffington Post, Common Dreams, and Mother Jones domains. Examples of the sort of posts I filtered are \"Sanders is this election's best advocate for internet freedom and access while Trump presents the largest threat\" and \"Clinton Gets an ‘F’ for Education Funding Claim\". \n\n[Here is what the front page of /r/politics looks like after \"hard ignoring\" about 20 users who submitted pro-Sanders/anti-Clinton links.](http://imgur.com/0F2M6Io) As you can see, it's much more informative and even-handed. \n\nThe only downside of this is that these users are on my ignore lists - I can still see (collapsed) posts from them, but their posts in all subreddits are not visible to me. Personally, I think this is an acceptable sacrifice. I'm a Sanders supporter, but I hate how some well-intentioned fellow supporters have made /r/politics into an extension of /r/SandersForPresident. The latter subreddit exists for a reason, as does /r/progressive. \n\nTL;DR using \"hard ignore\" greatly reduces the amount of biased links on the front page of /r/politics. ",

It does feel like smaller subs are favored but that's anecdotal and why I'm asking what others experiences are or what they know. It is not predictive (i.e. if I spend a lot of time on a particular sub it does not show me more of their content) though that would be cool, or better yet to be able to control it all together. For instance last week I may have been engaging a lot around a tv show I was (binge) watching but this week I'm more into a new game I got, I could go into settings and dial up or down the subs based on my interests at the time.\n\nNot sure I'm explaining it properly but hoping someone gets what I mean.

There might not be much new to say about Sanders himself by that point so I wouldn't be surprised if this manifests as mostly Hilary hate.\n\nIn the longer term, it seems unlikely that such a mobilised group would just disperse, but after the sustained levels of hate it also seems unlikely that they'll turn around and start supporting Hilary. It may be they give up on supporting anyone and become a kind of nihilistic anti-Hilary brigade out of spite, with some possibly migrating to Trump as the 'anti-establishment' alternative.\n\nAny thoughts?",

This thread is discussing whether or not the level of bigotry has changed, and why or why not. The fact that reddit has a bigot problem is obvious to anybody with a level head. With that being said, please stop arguing over whether or not /r/theredpill is misogynistic. It's a dead horse, and it's been discussed endlessly elsewhere. The answer is a resounding YES. It is misogynistic. I'm not going to explain why, because PLENTY of people have done it much better then I ever can. Please stay on topic. \n**/Edit**\n\nI'm not sure if there is actually a rise, or if I've just started noticing it more, but I think there's been a rise in bigotry and political sensationalism in all the major subreddits. I notice that even reddits like /r/technology and /r/science have posts with a political spin or angle on it. \n\nI've also noticed a lot more horribly racist and/or misogynistic comments. My theory is that this is a side effect of banning the major hate subreddits; ordinarily they would be confined to their \"racism hub\", but since that was removed, they've dispersed and that's what caused the rise. Alternatively, the rise may be due to another factor, and the existence of those subreddits was merely a symptom of that other factor. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

We've now gotten around to analyzing all the data, redesigning and relaunching the game. \n\nWe wrote a blog post with the main findings: https://medium.com/@gregstod/guess-the-karma-2-0-82a224a691f3#.emwaognme\n\nHere are the main points\n\n- People are not very good at this task. The average accuracy was 52.5%; when shown a pair of images, people would only guess the more popular one (measured by votes on reddit [upvotes - downvotes]) 52.5% of the time. \n\n- Accuracy increases as the difference in score of the images increases but not by much. When people see a pair of images that have a score of 10 and 9 respectively, they guess at 50%. When they see something like a score of 10,000 vs 10 they guess it right 60% of the time. \n\n- Spending more time on a question doesn't seem to improve accuracy. We were worried that lots of people were just randomly clicking but people spent an average of 10 seconds on each pair. Also, spending more time to submit a vote didn't increase the probability of being correct. \n\n\nWe were really surprised that people were pretty bad at this task (most of the participants came from Reddit). I guess I wanted to pose one of our hypotheses as a discussion point: \n\n&gt;  Does the lack of ability to accurately predict popularity from the image itself imply that something about Reddit popularity is really random? \n\n\nWe don't really know but we have been thinking about it. We redesigned the site a bit and launched a different set of questions to make sure that the results weren't driven by the experiment. We'd love to hear your thoughts!",

The way people always focus on disasters and crimes tends to make them cynical. And yet, people believe that they are seeing the way the world works, when they become news wonks.\n\nThe problem is this effect where a society dealing with its own problems halfway around the world has a certain context for that discussion, and those who get the news story by itself don't see that context.\n\nWhat I'm seeing on /r/news, /r/worldnews, and some other similar subreddits, is that there's always this default mode where mean/cynical people take over a topic and rule the roost. For example,  this has happened in recent months with a visceral hatred for the victims of the Syrian war, as they desperately try to make their way to a better life outside the war zone.\n\nFor over a decade, I have done my part to try to babysit discussions here at Reddit when I see this phenomenon happening. I come in and challenge everyone who's being mean, and I try to be nice to them, but also point out how they're being specious in their arguments. Meanwhile, I try to steer the conversation into a more constructive direction. When I do that, I see that immediately bunches of nice people start jumping into the conversation with constructive comments and ideas. These people just wouldn't choose to add in their ideas if they're going to be downvoted by a bunch of bigots or racists. There's this wonderful resource of readers on Reddit who can jump in and shift a discussion 180 degrees, in a heartbeat. If this is done consistently, the cynical brats can be vanquished from that topic over a week or two, and a whole new, refreshing frame of reference on the issue begins to embraced by Reddit, as a whole. This is thankless work, but it does seem to have some effect on the broader national discussion about the issue. This is because Reddit ranks among the [top 25 websites worldwide](https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2z5oze/til_reddit_is_now_ranked_by_traffic_in_the_top_25/). \n\nIf people don't do this kind of thing on these particular subreddits, I believe we'll just see that part of Reddit slowly become delegitimized in the eyes of the news wonks who visit. That's not a bad outcome, but if it happens, I wonder what we can do to create a new news link sharing website that doesn't fall into the same trap.\n",

They merely chose that major because they looked out into the world and learned that the really good software engineers can make 6 figures.\n\nNow consider the set of good programming tutors (some post in /r/cpp_questions) that are trying to offer tangible help and earn some karma in the process.\n\nGiven the reddit karma rules, there is absolutely no karma incentive to help a bad student. Here's why. If you (the good tutor) point out that the student is lazy or just asking the group to do the assignment, the bad student loses nothing by punishing your karma. The student can just keep posting and down-voting those who fail to help the bad student. If you decide to post the bulk of the assignment code to placate the infant student, you might get their up-vote but you'll alienate the other good tutors who lose nothing for down-voting you.\n\nThere is no downside for the bad student here assuming they care most about cheating the homework rather than karma. But there is nothing but downside for the good tutor. \n\nI am reminded of the final conclusion of WOPR, in the 80's film WarGames - WOPR proclaimed the Nash Equilibrium, which was - \"Not to play.\"\n\nThis is part of the reason the reddit karma system is game-theory blasphemy.\n",

This report presents new updated information about news consumption on the platform.\n\nAs someone currently writing a dissertation on breaking news reporting on reddit, I think this is a significant contribution to understanding news practices on reddit's platform. \n\nI'm also wondering what people think about their definition of \"news.\" As they ask in the survey:\n*Do you ever get news or news headlines on any of the following sites? Again, by news we mean information about events and issues that involve more than just your friends or family.*",

After a certain amount of time the value of a thread might not best derived from its upvote count because you've perhaps given most viewers that day the opportunity to upvote or downvote it as they see fit, but in subreddits where thread discussion is encouraged, it might be best after the first several hours or day or whatever to then base its page placement on whether the thread remains active. \n\nDoes this seem like something the community would value? Are people concerned that quality, active threads peter out too soon, or would this only serve to promote redundancy and spammy \"bump\"-style posts? Is there a way to factor out \"bump\" posts inside of a thread that could allow this sort of tweak to be a viable option?",

One of the comments reads\n&gt;and yet boys (in the UK at least) are not vaccinated, the stupid reasoning being that if the girls are vaccinated then the boys won't catch it either..... except if they have sex with someone who isn't vaccinated. The logic is just beyond belief. \n\n[Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/4726vm/hpv_sharply_reduced_in_teenage_girls_following/d09ru1n) and also [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/4726vm/hpv_sharply_reduced_in_teenage_girls_following/d0a9j5i), complete with the lack of capitalization to start the sentence and 4-dot ellipses.  \n\nI thought these might be a bot scraping popular comments from elsewhere (like the NYT comment section), but if that's the case I'd expect the \"and yet\" comment to appear in the /r/Science thread and it does not.

        "text": "I've been noticing more and more locked threads recently, particularly in tightly modded subs like the true____ subs, neutralpolitics, legaladvice, etc.\n\nAs a user, this is often very frustrating as I may have domain knowledge to contribute, or else have opened up a few tabs and am ready to make a well cited post, but have not realized the thread was locked.  Some CSS changes could certainly help with this issue, but I still feel that locking threads should be a last resort.\n\nWhile I understand the need for moderators to have this ability, I wonder whether it's being used too readily.  It seems suited mostly to brigading; where possible I'd rather see individual comments removed.  Because most locked threads are popular, it really puts the moderators at odds with the users, justified or not.  As a mechanism, it may invite conflict.\n\nI guess I have two points:\n\n* Can CSS changes be used to improve the user experience of locked threads?  It's very easy to overlook the header, instead getting straight into the comments.  Something visible throughout the page could be nice.\n\n* Does thread locking invite lazy moderation or invite conflict between users and moderators?",
