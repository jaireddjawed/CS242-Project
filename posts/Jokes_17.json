So he buys him a little toy tractor and Mikey is over the moon, takes the little tractor with him everywhere.\n\nComing up to Mikey's 6th birthday his dad asks him again what he would like. \"TRACTOR\" says Mikey. This kid really loves tractors so ok, another tractor toy. Mikey is over the moon, carries both of his tractors with him everywhere.\n\nHis 7th birthday is coming, dad comes along and asks what he wants. \"TRACTOR\". So dad rolls his eyes a little and decides to buy Mikey some clothes with tractors on them. Mikey loves them, wants to wear them all the time and still carries round his tractors everywhere.\n\n8th birthday, what does Mikey want? \"TRACTOR\". So his dad buys him a book about tractors. Loves it.\n\n9th birthday, new tractor clothes because the old ones don't fit any more. Thrilled.\n\n10th birthday, a tractor model for Mikey to build, he has the time of his life and displays it on his shelf next to his battered old toys.\n\nMikeys 11th birthday is coming up and his dad has an idea to buy Mikey a ride on a tractor down at a nearby farm. Mikey says thank you and seems like he's having a good time but his dad can see he's not as into it as he expected.\n\nComing up to Mikey's 12th birthday his dad asks him what he'd like. \"A playstation\" says Mikey. His dad is a bit surprised but it makes sense. So he buys him a playstation and a copy of Farming Simulator. Mikey loves it.\n\nFor his 13th birthday, Mikey asks for the new Call of Duty so he can play with his friends.\n\n14 he asks for a gaming headset.\n\n15, another new call of duty game\n\n16 he just wants cash for more games. And tells his dad he wants to be called Mike now.\n\n17 he wants cash again because he wants to take Stacy from his class on a date. So his dad gives him some advice about girls, takes him out to buy new clothes and sends him off to his date with money for a movie and for burgers after.\n\nThe date is going really well, Mike gets to second base in the back row of the theatre when people start screaming and panicking because the room is suddenly filling with smoke.\n\nMike doesn't panic though. He stands up and takes a huge breath in, sucking up all the smoke and clears the air so everyone can see their way to the exit. He walks over to the fire exit and blows all the smoke outside in one big breath.\n\n\"That's amazing\" says Stacy. \"How on earth did you do that?\"\n\n\"Oh it's easy\" says Mike, \"I'm an ex tractor fan.\"",

The driver, a man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer wrist watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, \"If I can tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?\" \n\nThe shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing sheep and replies, \"Okay.\" \n\nThe young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a NASA Website, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel tables filled with algorithms and pivot \ntables. He then prints out a 150-page report on his high-tech mini-printer, turns to the shepherd and says, ‘'You have exactly 1,586 sheep.\" \n\nThe shepherd cheers, \"That's correct, you can have your choicest sheep from the herd.\" \n\nThe young man takes one of the animals which he likes most and cute from the flock and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The shepherd looks at him and asks, \"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?\" \n\nThe young man laughed and answers, \"Yes, why not?\" \n\nThe shepherd says, \"You are an auditor.\" \n\n\"How did you know?\" asks the young man. \n\n\"Very simple,\" answers the shepherd. \n\n\" First, you came here without being wanted. Secondly, you charged me a fee to tell me something I already knew. Thirdly, you don't understand anything about my business... now can I have my DOG back?\"",
