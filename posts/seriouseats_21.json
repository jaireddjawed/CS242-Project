(So I genuinely don't understand how I didn't know there was a Serious Eats subreddit until today...)\n\nNow, currently, I live at home (job-hunting... plus, even with a job, this is New York), and while I don't keep kosher, my parents do. The site has a *lot* of recipes, especially recipes involving meat, that I'd love to make for the family, but I'd have to kosher them (remove dairy, substitute pork for something else, etc).\n\nOne thing I've discovered that I'm really bad at is substituting non-dairy \"milk\" beverages for milk (I learned this by attempting to make a non-dairy quiche... it turned into very wet scrambled eggs in a very burnt crust... and yes, I already know what I did wrong [liquid:egg ratio was... it was bad]). In some cases 1:1 works fine, but not in every case... *especially* not in cases where the *fat* in the milk is important...\n\nHere's one example... the [Chick-Fil-A Sandwich hack](https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/07/the-food-lab-how-to-make-a-chick-fil-a-sandwich-at-home.html#1232444). Would it be possible to make a kosher version of that (that is, there can't be a mixing of meat and dairy) that tastes at least *really close* to the original?\n\n(Incidentally, I'd love a continual Serious Eats feature where whomever's running it tries to make different recipes on the site kosher [or well... kosher style... no shellfish, pork, or mixing meat and dairy, basically] using science to come up with the best possible outcome... and also try to figure out the secret behind why *some* kosher versions of things, like kosher pizza, are just consistently horrid...)",

It offers two cooking methods: sous vide, and Dutch oven. Unfortunately I don't have a sous vide cooker, so I'll have to go with the Dutch oven method.\n\nAfter researching other Dutch oven corned beef recipes, however, something about Kenji's recipe struck me as odd. It says to cover the corned beef with water, bring to a simmer, and then transfer to a 200 degree oven for about 10 hours. However, all the other Dutch oven recipes I've found online say to just simmer for 2-3 hours. These wildly different cook times confuse me, so I'm not sure which way to go.\n\nCan someone shed some light on the two approaches? If you've tried either of them, how'd they turn out? Thanks!",

It says 22 ounces is about four cups of flour. Normally the weight I use from the back of the flour bag is 120g/cup, which works out to 480g for four cups. I plug the 22 ounces into google and convert to grams and it turns out that's 624g. Well no wonder it's so dry! That's 30% more flour!\n\nSo what's going on here? Is the recipe wrong or am I missing something? And can this dough be saved after its been rising for over an hour?",

        "text": "I think this appliance will be of interest to Serious Eats fan. Below is my impression of it.\n\nThe tasty one top is a plug in, one \"burner\" induction cook-top.  The base of the unit has a built in thermometer which can measure the temperature of the pan, and as well it comes with a plug in thermometer which can be inserted into the food or cooking liquid.  The cooktop connects via bluetooth to the tasty app, where the cooktop can be programmed and controlled.\n\nI bought the cooktop principally for sous vide and for frying.  The thermometer comes with a mount so it can be submerged in the pot and measure the temp of the water for sous vide or the temp of the oil for frying.  So far it's worked well for both applications.   In sous vide mode you set the temp and the length to cook, and it will bring the water to your chosen temp, then alert you when the timer runs out.  For frying you can just set the temp and it will hold it until you turn the cooktop off.  You can also just set the cooktop on, from a strength of 1-10, like a \"dumb\" cooktop.  The temperature probe can be always viewed in the app.\n\nFinally, the app has some special recipes which pair with the one top - the app will walk you through each prep and cooking step, and will control the cooktop as you go.  I've never tried this.  At least for now the recipe list isn't very long, and I prefer a bit more hands on approach.  \n\nPros:  \n\n- Can be used for sous vide + frying + regular cooking, for a price not much greater then a dedicated sous vide cooker.\n- App is easy to use.  \n- You can monitor the temperature and control the unit from your living room, etc.\n- Holds temperature accurately for sous vide (seems within +-1f with my informal testing).\n- Now I have a portable cooktop as well.\n\nCons:  \n\n- Runs off 15amp plug, so less power then a range or cooktop.  This was a problem when frying.  I couldn't add more then 3 meatballs to my oil (set to 350f) without the temp dropping faster then the cooktop could keep up.  \n- Outside of the tasty one top use, the Tasty app is annoying.  Worst is you're required to turn on notifications to connect to the one top, and Tasty sends a recipe notification every god damn day that I can't turn off.\n\nOverall I'm happy with the tasty one top.  I think for someone who wants to get into sous vide it's a nice combo machine which gives some extra use cases that you don't get with a one trick like the anova.  On the other hand the plug in limitation can hobble using it for other cooking styles.\n\nHope someone finds this helpful.  FYI I'm not in any way affiliated with Tasty, etc.    ",

My question is whether or not dry sherry will taste better than a Shaoxing **cooking** wine because from what I've read, the cooking wine is less awesome than a proper alcoholic Shaoxing wine that could only be sold at a liquor store, and most likely not at most US liquor stores.\n\nMy local chinese grocer does carry the [recommended brand by Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/04/chinese-pantry-essentials.html) (Pagoda brand) although I have no idea if it's salted or not.\n\nThoughts?",

As for the kitchenaid part, i keep it on setting 1 to get the dough all the same thickness then work down to a setting 3 with little issue. I think i use plenty of flour but at this point who knows.

But...  \n  The smoke made me cough a LOT, and even my wife in the other room coughed. I'm just curious what the cause was and if it's preventable. They didn't have arbol chilies so I got a bag of some kind of dried red Japanese pepper. I used 11 since I like my food spicy. It was a LITTLE spicier than I would have liked, so I'd maybe subtract 2 or 3 next time, but I definitely wouldn't want to go down to 6.  \n  Is it just the TYPE of pepper that made it so unmanageable, or is it just the nature of the dish? Would a wok have helped? I'd like to make it again, but it's honestly not worth it for me for the discomfort. We were coughing off and on for like the next hour.  ",

Why the whole hour? \n \nI would pre-heat for an hour if using my pizza stone, but this pizza is assembled in a cast iron skillet, and placed cold into the hot oven... So why pre-heat for a whole hour? \n \nIs this the best way to cook this pizza?",

        "text": "Hey,\n\nI finally got around to trying to make Serious Eats' [toasted cream](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/01/toasted-cream.html) recipe. I chose to use the baking soda and 2hrs pressure cooked in an instant pot on high - because it seemed like that would get the most striking results in the shortest time (go big or go home... right?)\n\nAll the descriptions throughout all the literature on this had me believing it would come out with a big creamy nutty browned butter flavour profile. What actually came out was a bit underwhelming; it sort of tasted *different*, but that's all I could really say, rather than being able to pin down any positive flavours from it. I wouldn't call it any of the above. Any of the typical fresh sweetness in the cream was gone. I struggled to find anything to use this for; I added it to a pan sauce and it only seemed to have negative effects on the flavour. I tried adding some to garlic and herb sauteed mushrooms but it didn't really work with those flavours either. As per the photography in the recipe I added some to some black coffee and was just left with the taste of service station coffee with UHT cream.\n\nActually, thinking about it... is that what I've basically made? UHT cream? Because if that's all it is I can buy that from the supermarket in a carton next time, at a fraction of the price of fresh cream, and save myself the effort.\n\nUnless I'm doing something really wrong?\n\nIs it possible to pressure cook for longer than 2hrs to intensify the flavours? Or does the baking soda have a negative effect on the flavour - should I try it without? (I've had poor results actually with adding baking soda to caramelising onions, it helps with the browning but does have a weird sort of \"chemically\" effect on the flavour that I've never been able to pin down using words)\n\nOr does the sous vide version lead to a superior flavour?\n\nOr was I just expecting too much?!\n\nAlso has anyone found any ideal applications for this? I've got most of a pint of the stuff left in the fridge to use... 🤔\n\nThanks :)",

I could still taste the hot sauce but probably over half of it was pooled at the bottom of the bowl and it wasn't as spicy as I would expect with that sauce. Any ideas for what I did wrong or how I can get it to stick better?",
