This raises the question of whether the model's inability to solve logical problems is rooted in its lack of the ability to count, and thus is missing a necessary feedback loop.\n\nIt is capable of generating a range of numbers that mimic counting, but it does not possess a declarative memory that would allow it to save, recall and increment numbers, indicating that it may not possess the capacity for true counting.\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, what implications does this have on the relationship between language, logic, and counting?\n\n**If you haven't heard of GPT:**\n\nGPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a type of machine learning model that uses a neural network to generate natural language text. The model is \"pre-trained\" on a large dataset of text, which allows it to learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases.\n\nWhen given a prompt, GPT uses this pre-trained knowledge to generate text that is coherent and similar to the text in the dataset it was trained on. Essentially, it works by taking the input prompt and predicting the next word in the sequence, then repeating the process until a coherent response is generated.\n\nOne of the key features of GPT is its ability to pay attention to context. This means that when it generates text, it takes into account the words and phrases that come before and after the text it is generating. This allows it to generate text that is more coherent and makes more sense in the context it is being used.\n\n*Disclaimer: the above text has been generated using GPT based on my requirements.*",

But to say the universe itself _is_ a mathematical in structure, and furthermore, that _all_ computable and coherent mathematical structures _also_ have a physical existence seems just so obviously wrong, because mathematical objects are nothing more or less than ideas, which are simply a different _type_ of thing than physical objects. \n\nPreviously I had simply dismissed the whole idea as logically flawed and erroneous for the above reasons, but today PBS Spacetime did a video about it (https://youtu.be/F__elfR3w8c) and made it sound at least semi-reasonable.  They compared it to Plato's forms, and I initially had the same in objection to that  idea, but I actually asked about it on here previously and was told that Plato didn't mean the forms had _physical_ existence, which seems to me a fundamental difference between the forms and Tegmark's claims.  Even so, PBS Spacetime are a respected and well-regarded physics education channel, not crackpots, so now I'm wondering if I've been overly dismissive of the idea.  Even so, they aren't philosophers and have occasionally put forward some rather questionable ideas in the philosophy of physics (though they're usually pretty good about being upfront when they're discussing a speculative and/or questionable idea).

I am also not particularly well read (I struggle with attention) and a large part of my views have been formed listening to various podcasts while working and watching YouTube videos.\n\n\nI am trying to read more and develop my viewpoint as for some reason trying to have a somewhat cogent moral position has become very important to me. \n\n\nI am open to any and all criticism and suggestions for reading, watching, listening. I hope this isn't too general but I am just a relatively uneducated person trying to see what's out there. Also if you feel I have not outlined anything correctly please let me know, that's part of why I posted because I'm not sure I understand some things correctly!\n\n\nMy current views are as follows:\n\n\nWhile it seems clear to me that for an overall societal approach the basic tenet of consequentialist moral philosophy must be applied, in practice it is not a full-spectrum solution. \n\nMy sense is that our morals ultimately come from our brains, our evolutionary development as humans. Moving into the future they become perhaps less relevant, hence the need for a largely rational, consequentialist approach. However in more personal situations it must be accepted in my view that humans will act according to their \"moral sense\" - coming from a combination of nature and nurture (like many things I guess). I guess many moral decisions must be made on a case by case basis due to these two factors sometimes being in conflict. I don't know if this makes me a pragmatic moralist?\n\nI am also somewhat swayed by Peter Singers consequentialist argument (roughly as follows):\n\n- certain hypothetical rebuttals of the \"repugnant conclusion\" (i.e harvesting the one person's organs to save many, pushing the baby in front of traffic to save people from being hit by a bus) do not hold water as a society in which these actions were morally acceptable would create such fear and suffering that it would reduce overall well-being.",

It seems like's Spinoza's God except continuously moving through history, rather then it being static. \nSchopenhauer who was quite abusive towards Hegel said that his philosophy was a \"monstrous amplification of the ontological arguement\", as he said that Causality is a priori as the \"understanding\" must be detect a change in the sense-organ in comparison to Kant's understanding where we must think through the 12 categories. I agree with Schopenhauer that causality is a priori, since perception cannot just be given to us in the Kantian sense; but as reading Hegel is quite tedious, is it true that he reuses the cosmological arguement?",

This is where I'm starting to think that all those toxic  positivity and optimism bias are just a bunch of BS or nonsense, which  is unrealistic, and people just ignore or deny the cold, harsh reality  of life.\n\nWhich again reminds me back of Murphy's law. \"Anything that can go wrong  will go wrong\". I wonder if this is also true and also apply to  everyday life as well? From my own personal life's experiences, at least  this quote seems to be much more realistic. It portrays the harsh  reality of life, at least in my case. Some people in this world have  'bad lucks' so much, that they have a hard life, or a sad, depressing  life. That's just the reality.\n\nWhat do you think? Hope to hear the responses and thoughtful discussions.\n\n(Sorry if my English is not good, as I'm from Indonesia, so English is not my first language)",

One stating that we would marry the wrong person because we will love the wrong things that are unnatural and very selective. The writers for these series heavily reference kierkegaard on love ( wich he view that had its full purity in the Christian idea of love) and anxiety towards ones ultimate purpose. \nOther approaches I’ve looked at are poets but I felt this showed more of a romanticism that philosophical and ethically speaking that alienated a lot of other factors and where to personal. \n\nBut I was wondering what the fundamentals approach would be to this with psychology and theological spheres of influence as well. To be noted, I’m as starting on platos idea of love and what it means to love a person and be loved. \n\nWith the school of life videos he heavily states that we as a society it is inevitable that we will marry the right person, that the standards for marriage are too selective. Other videos suggested dating withing your range. But I wondered what determined the worth of range in this aspect. How is love and worthiness exchanged? Can it be forced on direction over another? Are we in a caste system of determinable love? Can people change their personalities/ or maybe ratios of self to move up and down this exchange system to find or gain the love most desireable?\n\nIf someone could point this in the criteria of both men and women of varying ages…? \n\nOther ideas of purposely choosing someone who might just fit the idea of your personal love but to get to this conclusion of finding someone good enough…people had to go through painful loves that were often destructive. \n\nAre their many other authors and books that focused not only on the modern psychology of love, relationships of varying degrees and isolation and loneliness/ alienation and how they ultimately affect our love language and understanding.",

If God is omniscient, then God knows when evil exists.\n4. If God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to eliminate all evil.\n5. Evil exists.\n6. If evil exists and God exists, then either God doesn’t have the power to eliminate all evil, or doesn’t know when evil exists, or doesn’t have the desire to eliminate all evil.\n7. Therefore, God doesn’t exist.\n\nDoes the idea that God will eventually make all of creation perfect, sometime in the future, provides an adequate response to the problem of evil? This idea is found in some religions (apparently Zoroastrianism) and some ancient formulations of Christian theology (most notably in Origen and Gregory of Nyssa).\n\nIt would seem to answer the objection that God, being omnipotent and desiring evil not to exist will accomplish that, just not right now, eliminating the apparent contradictions highlighted by premise 6.\n\nOne particular rebuttal I can think of to this proposal is that present and past evils already existing would mean that God cannot eliminate *all* evil. But could it be argued, on the other hand, that universal restoration implies that past evils will be addressed through some form of cosmic justice and thus ultimately eliminated?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the classic problem of evil through the prism of Apocatastasis?

        "text": "Of course, ethics and morality are subjective (at least for the most part). In both scenarios, the person continues to do said actions. In the scenario where they change their moral code to line up with what they are doing, they are not changing it for everyone else (rules for thee but not for me).\n\nOn 1 hand, I think going against your moral and ethics code willingly (or your society or cultures) can be a sign of psychological problems, and if it was something relatively benign it can cause a lot of self hate and guilt (maybe a religious figure who preaches against self pleasure but engages in it themselves). I respect the honesty and consistency here though. Some might question a persons ability to break their own moral code.\n\nOn the other hand, we are a moral creature, but I see more hypocrisy in shifting your goal post. Perhaps in both cases, the person is a hypocrite, but I respect someone who says, \"No, what I am doing/did is bad\" rather than grasp at straws as to why it is okay for them. They are hobest but in a sense also immoral in their own eyes.\n\nI realize if it is something benign, people might have their whole moral compass change to think the action itself isn't that bad. I think that is a normal part of human development but not part of the scenario I lay out.\n\nExamples: someone thinks a certain type of music is sinful to listen to. They either shift their goal post morally to see themselves listening to it, purely out of enjoyment, as being acceptable but not for anyone else. Or they engage in the action as a sort of guilty pleasure.\n\nAnother more extreme example: a murderer who either thinks they did wrong by murdering, or somehow tries to justify why their victims needed to die. No doubt this would play in their prison sentence as the 1st scnario shows remourse and moral values more in line with society.\n\nWhat is better if your eyes? At a societal level but also for someone you know personally? I would think on a personal and societal level, I would prefer if someone realized and accepted that they break their own ethical and moral code. I would think it would be easier to rehabilitate them on a societal level, but I also prefer an honest friend who doesn't shift their goal post and see themselves as always in the right, even if they continue to do things they think are wrong.\n\nTLDR: title sums up the question. Paragraphs provide some of my reasoning in each case and a couple of examples. In the case where someone shifts their moral compass, they are only doing it for themselves and nobody else.",

My argument against determinism is not necessarily incompatible with it, but it should at least be counter-intuitive. Here it is. \n\nIn a deterministic world, how is it that I can plan, anticipate something?  For instance, I can decide to go to Japan in one year and buy tickets today.  There is every reason to think that I will indeed go to Japan in a year.  In my case, every time I planned a trip it always ended up taking place on the date I had planned it. I don't think there are much reason to think that the trip won't happen even though there is always a risk that something will happen just before. \n\nLet's say the trip to Japan eventually happened. In a non-deterministic, it wouldn't be surprising : I just used my free will (classic free will definition, not compatibilist) to make whatever I thought one year ago. But in a deterministic world, it means that I've pretty much predicted the future. Yet, I did not use any complex physical equations to try to predict the state of the atoms of my body in a year (that would be impossible anyway). I shoudn't be able to think the state of the atoms that far in time right ? If I was materialist I would even ask : how is it that the state of my atoms one year before the trip created in me a subjective experience consistent with what indeed happened a year later (going to Japan) ? \n\nI wanted to develop even more but I didn't want to sound confusing. \n\nWhat do you guys think ?",

I have discovered that phenomenology in a Husserlian mode and semiotics in a Peircean mode are thoroughgoing in their anti-psychologism. Anti-psychologism came up in my readings in phil math years ago, but it was peripheral to my interests at the time. I'd like to repair my neglect of the topic. I'm specifically interested in any good historical and critical assessments of anti-pychologism which have been published since Peirce, Frege, and Husserl were writing.\n\nShorter writings preferred. I just want to get a quick n dirty sense for what anti-psychologism is about, its historical scope and impact, etc., before I approach phenomenology and semiotics.",

        "text": "I know there are different schools of determinism so I don't know which one will apply but let's just say the proposition is... \"everything\" is known/determined but \"only\" in a causal space. \"Only\" in a causal space implying the possibly of things outside causality....like maybe indeterminism, concrete properties, something underlying, fundamental, or everything is the present(time is an abstraction/illusion). Idk.\n\nNow assuming everything is determined in a causal space does this imply there are no concrete properties within a causal space? Like is it valid to think that if something was truly concrete then it would have causal power or that it can't be determined...like it transcends causality... because if something is truly concrete then it just \"is\"... can't be caused into existence? Therefore, would that imply everything within a causal space is infinitely abstract? Like all properties have properties within them... And you can just keep reducing/dividing infinitely? Sounds like nihilism(no inherent meaning in anything)...like we create or negotiate our own meaning. Would this therefore imply infinite regress... just infinite past and future? And then would this entail that  everything is really just the \"present\"? Like if I take everything in this causal space from past to future and put it in a box does that make it all just one singular present moment? Time/everything being an illusion? Is that concrete or fundamental?\n\nI'm also here to talk about the limits or what is not within a causal space. Where is quantum mechanics in a causal space? Or is it separate? Does QM imply indeterminism? Is indeterminism fundamental or concrete? Does it imply concrete properties? Is there indeterminism and determinism?\n\nAlso, Is causality limited by the speed of light? Can causal influences transcend the limit of speed? Or is that a contradiction. Similarly...can concrete properties be caused or is determinism only limited within a abstract space?\n\nSorry for all these questions and my repetitiveness!",

The following question came up in tutorial and I'm  wondering if my reasoning is correct or if I'm just confusing the  students.\n\nThe question is : \"Can there be a valid argument whose premises are all necessary truths, and whose conclusion is contingent?\"\n\nClaim: No such sentence exists.\n\nProof:  Call the conclusion A and the premises B1...Bn. By validity we know  that there is no case in which, if all Bi's are true, that the  conclusion is false. We know that all the premises are necessarily true,  therefore the conclusion, A is true. The Bi's being necessary truths  also means that there is no truth evaluation of the Bi's other than them  being all true, meaning that the truth evaluation of A will also always  be true. Therefore A is a necessary truth.\n\nSince A is a necessary truth, it cannot be contingent.\n\nThe  problem I have with this question is that it's essentially asking if  this proto-theory of TFL is consistent which is big question. Anyway,  just wanted to know if this reasoning works!\n\n(Also for the mathies out there, I have a math background if you want to get technical. That's another thing that bothers me about this proof, I feel like there's not enough foundation to give a 'proper' proof but maybe i'm just crazy)\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I know that AI generated art is a long way off replacing human artists (and I'm still not clear if it ever will) but is there a theoretical point at which the power of AI art becomes bad for society?\n\nThe camera is one invention that seems relevant here. There was a point in which art was mostly valued for its realism and then the camera was invented. Over time there was a shift away from realism in art. It would be foolish to claim that the camera lead to the death of art, but for those artists who made their career in realistic painting, it very well may have lead to the deaths of their careers.\n\nThe camera lead to the birth of other new artforms of course: most obviously photography. Photography has its own techniques to master, but with the ease of the technology, the artistic skill shifts away from technical craftsmanship towards the skill of a curator. A good photographer is one who has an eye for selecting the best images.\n\nAll well and good. The camera was invented and people still made art. But let's imagine some other technologies, ones that might disrupt the art world more significantly. \n\n1. At the touch of a button, an AI can produce a convincing new novel in the style of any given author.\n2. An AI can generate a fun computer game, from scratch, complete with art, animation and sound.\n3. An AI can generate an emotionally stirring symphony, or any other complex piece of instrumental music.\n4. An AI can generate a Television show with complex themes and characters.\n\nNow, as a consumer this sounds very exciting. We might have access to more content! For an artist, they might be able to create what they envision more quickly. One could argue that for every AI generated symphony created there would still have to be someone evaluating it and judging it in comparison to other AI generated symphonies. There would still be an artistic process of selecting the best one, much like a photographer. Right?\n\nOkay, but what happens if even this artistic process is invalidated? What if the AI becomes more proficient than humans at evaluating one AI generated symphony over another? Why would anyone devote a year of their life to write a novel or a symphony, when AI could easily generate and select the best one for them?\n\nNow, this might all seem very hypothetical, but what I'm concerned about is the movement away from humans as active creators of art, to humans as passive consumers of art. Wouldn't it be sad if there were less jobs in the arts industry? 10 years ago, I would have said that menial labor jobs were more at risk of being made redundant by technology in the future, but now I'm not so sure. Shouldn't we be hoping instead for a future in which AI does our menial labor for us while we spend most of our time making art, not the other way around?",

Authors that feel violated by this use refer to metaphors like blending their work like a puree, or shredding it for a collage, but the actual process is much more subtle and hard to intuit. A network built to emulate this grey mass we have between the ears is actually minimally influenced by every piece of data presented to it, then the final product is frozen and packaged for use.\n\nUsers quickly discovered that they could ask the final AI to emulate certain artists and styles, like bringing back Cézanne for a painting of a dog drinking a milkshake, or emulating Kafka's style to discuss the absurdity of the DMV. It also opens the unethical possibility of imitating living artists' styles to impersonate them, or the more acceptable use of mixing different styles like paint to create new things, like an almost photorealistic, somewhat airbrushed style with anime influences that has become associated with AI art recently. It is possible that AI prompting will evolve into something closer to engineering, with procedures and protocols to ensure quality and security, but right now there is an almost shamanic quality to it, with practicioners exchanging recipes and magic words found by trial and error to elicit good results.\n\nWhich bring us back to the question. Is this a tech bro version of the Jungian Collective? A repository of amalgamated wisdom we pull from to answer our questions with something that may not be entirely accurate, but that sure sounds plausible? And as a bonus question, could this be a form of immortality?

        "text": "I'm going to casually reconstruct a testimony I'd like help interpreting. It comes out of Watts *et al*. (2017) \"Patients’ Accounts of Increased ‘Connectedness’ and ‘Acceptance’ After Psilocybin for Treatment-Resistant Depression\" for those interested (great read). It goes like this:\n\nSo there's this woman who has been seriously depressed for a long time. Anti-depressants, therapy: nothing has helped. She goes into this psychedelic therapy trial. Before taking the dose, she sees some orchids. She \"knows intellectually\" that the orchids are beautiful, but she does not experience them *as* beautiful. They're just some flowers, whatever. Then she takes the dose. During and after her trip, she says that she properly experiences the orchids as beautiful, and is moved by their beauty. A year later, a lot of her depressive symptoms have returned. But she insists: the orchids are still beautiful. Their beauty still reaches her. That's what sticks.\n\nI tend to come at things like this from phenomenology (I think Heidegger would do well here), but am also super interested in the aesthetics angle. Open to whatever you might have to say, though. Let a hundred flowers bloom...\n\nAlso, I once saw a quote attributed to Plato that went something like this: \"Beauty stains the soul no matter what depths it sinks to\". Have never found the source for it. So bonus points if you know.\n\nMany thanks. Peace.",

At first, I assumed the answer to be whatever I need - something necessary to function or live, but are our needs not solely based on what we want? A person only takes the necessary steps to live, because they want to live. There are also many (too many) examples of people that did/do not want to live, and so they do not. Putting their wants before their needs - maybe this is why suicide is considered selfish by some?\n\nBut if we are all driven by our wants, are we not all selfish in nature?\n\nSorry if I'm asking too many questions.

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI was reading Martin Peterson's \"An Introduction to Decision Theory\" textbook and I saw the following definition of strong dominance.\n\n\"Strong Dominance stipulates that for an alternative to be more rational than another, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, its outcomes under all states must be at least as good as those of the other alternative. Secondly, there must also be at least one state under which the outcome is strictly better than that of the other alternative.\"\n\nFrom my previous econ and computer science courses, I learned that if there is a state where action a and action b produce the same outcome, one strategy cannot be strongly (strictly) dominating the other one. It can only weakly dominate the other one. However, the above excerpt seems to be saying otherwise. Can someone clarify this?",

I realise this is basically most of philosophy, so you can just recommend your favourite bits of philosophy or things that you think would be helpful for writing a book. Even something like topics to look up on Stanford Encyclopedia would be great.\nIntros and overviews would help the most, but feel free to also recommend primary works and university textbooks, especially for the things you think could be most valuable. Although I think I want more of a \"wide\" knowledge rather than \"deep\".\n\nI've got a list of potential topics to read about, but I'm not very educated on philosophy and I was hoping you could share yout opinion on what I should add to this list and what I should remove. I probably won't be able to read all of it, so the list could probably use some shortening.\n\nMy list so far:\n-Plato and an overview of ancient philosphy\n-overview of Medieval philosophy\n-something on Descartes\n-Kant, Hegel, maybe Fichte and some overview type of book on German Idealism\n-some secondary works on Nietzsche, maybe also On the Genealogy of Morality\n-Bataille\n-other German philosophers like Heidegger and Schopenhauer\n-Rick Roderick's lectures on 20th century philosophy \"Self under Siege\", maybe some other of his lectures\n-find some overview book on existentialism\n-secondary works on modernism, structuralism and 20th century philosophy in general\n-post-structuralism and postmodernism (Todd May's Intro to Deleuze and something about Baudrillard, Derrida and Foucault), might focus on deconstructionism in particular\n-something on Adorno, Mark Fisher, maybe some Umberto Eco",

I love philosophy, but I admit that I never read nearly as much as I should have and only focused on writing essays to pass my classes. Thus, I have a very sporadic knowledge of philosophical topics. For example, I can very clearly understand and explain Nietzsche's idea of the Übermensch vs Kierkegaard's Knight of Faith, as I wrote extensively on it, meanwhile I couldn't tell you much more about the two individuals, or even existentialism as a whole. What I'm really looking to do is gain a fresh understanding of philosophy as a whole and fill in the gaps of my learning, I just don't know a good place to start. Do any of you have recommendations for specific books or topics that would help me get started? Thank you.\nTLDR: Looking for advice on gaining a basis of knowledge in philosophy.",
