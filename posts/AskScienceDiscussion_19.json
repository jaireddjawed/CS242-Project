We have got an idea of what we want, but not how to get there. It takes place in a future where much of Earth has been covered by water. I have been thinking of a way to do this for hours now. I've tried [Googling](https://www.google.com/search?q=How+could+you+add+a+large+amount+of+water+to+the+Earth%3F&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS813US813&amp;oq=How+could+you+add+a+large+amount+of+water+to+the+Earth%3F&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.17052j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) this question and it comes to nothing. I came up with the idea of comets but they seem unrealistic as a large amount of them would have to actually collide with Earth. There are two factors I can see in that, one being them actually hitting Earth, uncommon, and two, them falling out of the Oort Cloud or the Kuiper Belt, also uncommon. I don't know if this would make any sense.\n\nIf anyone has an answer **backed by science** then I would be very thankful.

        "text": "A bit background on this question. I originally asked it in r/worldbuilding and got several answers, but I still don't understand the resulting paradox. So excuse me for my sci-fi themed question, but I need to know what will happen.\n\nFirst, my brief understanding of physics. Einstein's Law of General Relativity defines Time and Space as one. Which means that Space will affect Time and vice versa. This concept is taken to an extreme inside the event horizon of a black hole, where your time to fall into the blackhole becomes infinity for an outside eye. That means other people never saw you reached the blackhole.\n\nNow, this is where I come in. In my universe, teleportation is possible AT ANY SCALE. That means people can teleport a cat, a planet, or a blackhole even (bear with me).\n\nThe question is what will happen to the Space-Time when an object as big as a black hole disappears entirely?\n\nBlack hole bends Space-Time into a steep curvature. Let's assume that the Space-Time Continuum returns to its normal flat surface. Then person A jumps into a blackhole, while person B watch from distance. On normal circumstance in person B eyes, his friend never reaches the blackhole. Then suddenly, someone teleports the blackhole away and person A is left behind.\n\nTime will snap back to normal. But, what does person A and B see during that snap to normal? Wouldn't that create a paradox?\n\nUnder normal circumstances, as person A falls down for 10 seconds, he will see the entire history of the universe unfolds. The moment he reaches the event horizon will be the end of time, since relative from B, he will reach it at infinity time.\n\nDuring that time, even a millisecond will mean a million years has flashed in front of his eyes. Then SNAP!\n\nOn your assumption, A returns to normal time and meets B, surviving to tell the vision of the future in front of his eyes. BUT, during the fall, he saw in the future that B finally went back to their ship, leave him, and never comes back for a million years. Which never happens, since he is now with B.\n\nLet's try to resolve this paradox by making a perfect circle:\n\nDuring that fall, A must witness himself free as the black hole teleports and meeting B. Since there is only one blackhole, that means he should be free too. If he does, then he's free before the first 10 seconds of his fall!\n\nThis is confusing...\n\nThe second explanation is that he jumps into the future by millions of years. But during that jump, the blackhole will have been teleported, so that is impossible...\n\n",

Typically, I've heard that a sufficiently large nuclear exchange could lead to the dimming of sunlight, with temperatures decreasing at least 1C. But, that year's El Nino caused temperatures to *increase*, and also led to increased rainfall and volatile hurricane seasons in the Pacific.\n\nWhat impacts would this particularly strong El Nino have in the midst of a nuclear conflict? Would the increased rainfall dissipate fallout in affected areas? Would the nuclear detonations be enough to cause disruptions to weather patterns, and counter-act the El Nino itself? ",

        "text": "According to the 2015 review [The Flaws and Human Harms of Animal Experimentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594046/):\n\n&gt;The unreliability of animal experimentation across a wide range of areas undermines scientific arguments in favor of the practice‚Ä¶ animal experimentation often significantly harms humans through misleading safety studies, potential abandonment of effective therapeutics, and direction of resources away from more effective testing methods‚Ä¶\n\n&gt;Because much pharmaceutical [data is] publicly unavailable, it is difficult to know the number of missed opportunities due to misleading animal experiments. However, of every 5,000‚Äì10,000 potential drugs investigated [through animal experiments], only about 5 proceed to Phase 1 clinical [human] trials [a 99.9% failure rate].\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 review [Can Animal Models of Disease Reliably Inform Human Studies?](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000245):\n\n&gt;The value of animal experiments for predicting the effectiveness of treatment strategies in clinical trials has remained controversial, mainly because of a recurrent failure of interventions apparently promising in animal models to translate to the clinic‚Ä¶ [this] failure may be explained in part by methodological flaws in animal studies, leading to systematic bias and thereby to inadequate data and incorrect conclusions‚Ä¶\n\n&gt;In fact, clinical trials are essential because animal studies do not predict with sufficient certainty what will happen in humans.\n\n\n\nFinally, according to a 2004 review [Where is the evidence that animal research benefits humans?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC351856/):\n\n&gt;Much animal research into potential treatments for humans is wasted because it is poorly conducted and not evaluated through systematic reviews.\n\n&gt;Clinicians and the public [believe] that animal research has contributed to the treatment of human disease, yet little evidence is available to support this view. Few methods exist for evaluating the clinical relevance or importance of basic animal research‚Ä¶\n\n&gt;Despite the lack of systematic evidence for its effectiveness, basic animal research in the United Kingdom receives much more funding than clinical research‚Ä¶ The contribution of animal studies to clinical medicine requires urgent formal evaluation.\n\n[Rest deleted on mod's request]",

A further question, could these things start to interact, evolve, and develop a sort of consciousness. Lastly he branched off and proposed that if this was the case, there may be a possibility that our entire universe may be governed under some sort of defined rules that, between the beginning of the universe and today, somehow shaped our physics.
