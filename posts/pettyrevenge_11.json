        "text": "So this just happened but it’s been about 5days since it started. A few days ago we see the neighbor try and run a dog over in his car from our bedroom window.I thought what the fuck… and went on with life. Day later we see him grab his adult pit bull by his neck and drag him inside while kicking a baby puppy blue healer off his porch. So the other day me and my wife were out back smoking while our 3 boys played in the front yard. Randomly this guy from across our field and the street comes outta his house kicking his pit bull out the door yelling. Then comes the puppy getting kicked outta the house. Well all the yelling cause me and the wife to look up from our phones over across the way. Well… that pissed him off cause then he started yelling at us that he was gunna come over and knock my fucking head in. Whatever. Everyone in Texas has a gun on the other side of every door in there house that don’t have kids. (Mines safely locked away, but thumb print fast) try and knock my head in. So he went back inside and we smoked another cigarette for shits and giggles. When the wife was done she went back inside. I finished mine, got up opened my door and stood there looking at his house from across my field for about a min. That pissed him off cause outta the house he comes flying down the porch and to the edge of his yard yelling about how he was gunna fuckin kill me and this and that. Never left his yard. I stood there watching with a shit eating grin to my self. He must have gotten bored cause he went back to his tormented shell of a life and disappeared back inside. So today I went to work and got a message that crazy tryed to run over the puppy when he got home. Well we give our leftover scraps to the stray dogs during the colder days and months to help and not waste. Cue the revenge. Puppy’s been smelling the food out there and comming to help himself. Since I worked a half day today as it’s like 25 degrees I came home and seen puppy waltzing across the field to look for food. So instead of going in through my back door I walked the house and called for the puppy over my shoulder as I went to the front door. Slowly he followed. Iam around my house calling for puppy quietly to come here and he followed me. He didn’t let me pet him at first, he was scared. When he did let me touch him he was all wet and almost frozen. Now he’s got a loving home with3 boys to love him and his name is nibbler. Wife just named him lol",

        "text": "I'm not a member of this sub, but my partner is and they encouraged me to put this up here since y'all may appreciate it. \n\nSo, we live on a residential street, but that street is one of the main entry/exit points to the neighborhood with a lighted intersection at a main street, so there is heavier traffic on our road than in other parts of the neighborhood, and people using it are often pretty dickish about the use of shared space. People often speed, run stop signs, and blow down the street despite speed bumps and the presence of children. It's stupid, and dangerous, and when out walking my dog we just wave everyone by. Our neighborhood has multiple schools, and kids all over the place at all times of day, elderly folks out for a stroll, dog walkers, cyclists.......people doing people things in their neighborhood. \n\nMy main method of transportation is by bike, and let me tell you, these folks who don't understand that you drive differently in a neighborhood than you do on a main road or freeway have a real hard time with that despite being on, again, a residential street. \n\nBut my neighborhood, she has my back. About a block and a half from my house there is a vicious dip. Like this thing will fuck your car up, bad, unless you go over it in a lifted truck or are absolutely crawling. Like, barely moving. This dip is also difficult to see, and gauge the severity of, and usually people aren't paying attention. If you don't live here, you may not know about it, or underestimate it, and we hear the crunch of bumpers and the scrape of undercarriages all the time, followed quickly by the brakes of people who weren't focused on the road. The intersection where this dip is also only has two stop signs, for cross traffic to the dip, letting the dip do the work of slowing traffic down like a yield sign.\n\nToday, like many other days, I was coming home from the store, and a car pulled up behind me. I was riding center lane because there were people working between two parked cars that I could see and hear, but the driver behind me couldn't. My presence in the middle of the street really fucked them right off, and they started gunning their engine, rather than waiting for me to clear the parked cars. I glanced behind me, saw the gesticulations, and sped up. I hit that dip going at least 15 mph (fast for a bike, but well below speed limits for a residential area). If I stand up on my pedals and use my knees and elbows to absorb the shock, it's actually not a big deal for me to hit this dip going fast. In fact, I rarely slow down for it, though don't often intentionally speed up. Unless the driver behind me is acting like they have no sense in, once again, a residential neighborhood. \n\nNow this car and I are on a journey together that will not end well for one of us. I speed up, and I imagine they feel good that I got the message and am fleeing, fear in my little heart, at the might of their vehicle (which was a nice ass car. A Jaguar. I almost felt bad. Almost). I hit the dip, as usual, and kept going. About two seconds later they hit the dip. The sound of scraping plastic, grating metal, and the bounce of their entire car smacking the asphalt took all my rage at their entitlement and turned it to pretty smoke that was carried away with the breeze. I felt lighter. Immediately following this episode, I did what I always intended to do, and moved to the right where there were no cars or people and let them pass. The speed at which they went over the remaining speed bumps was comical. Like a child tip-toeing past the room of sleeping parents to steal a cookie in the dead of night. \n\nThis is not the first time I've done this. It won't be the last. I've also been a helpful fairy; when I see a car coming too fast, I wave them down. If they are behind me and have been keeping a respectful distance, I slow to make them slow, saving the underside of their car. I'm not only a siren, luring drivers into the depths of this dip. But so help me, every time a driver puts me, or someone else in danger, I will sing the siren song of the dip as loudly as I can, and watch them dash themselves upon it.",

        "text": "Context:\nI work in a multinational company regulated by entities such as the FDA, WHO and others. In 2021 and the first 8 months of 2022 my job consisted of writing protocols and executing them to finally produce reports to qualify materials and equipment. These types of documents require multiple people with different expertise to review and approve. This whole process can take several months. Most of the time the same person will start the project from scratch and finalize it because knowledge transfer on this type of work is feasible, but time-consuming. Sometimes in the middle of 2022 I became tired of this type of work and wanted to try a more hands-on job, which was easily achievable within the same company. I even stayed in the same department, but not under the same boss. So in September I switched and made sure I didn't let my old boss high and dry by saying I would continue 4 or 5 projects I had already started. She asked me to stay on her team multiple times, but I was ready for a change. By continuing a couple projects I could be mutated faster, and it would leave some time for my old boss to find a replacement. I absolutely love my new job, team and boss. The cherry on top is the 15-20% pay increase which came with it. So I continue my life with my new job and a couple of projects from my old position and answer questions from my old team pretty much every week.\n\n\n\nThe knife in the back:\nAt the end of 2022 comes performance reviews, and to be honest I am not expecting a pay increase at all because of my fresh new job. My current Boss confirmed however that he is happy with my work and wants to give me a raise anyway. Fast-forward to the beginning of 2023, my Boss convokes me and announces that I've been placed on the naughty list. From all employees of my job type\\class I had been placed on the 5% underachievers by my old boss, referencing only my old position. These bosses are obligated to find underachievers and give them a lower pay increase than other employees, so they can give a higher pay raise to the 5% overachiever. My Boss explains that he couldn't do anything because it comes from my old Boss, which had me working for her for most of 2022. I mean, I knew I was not the best or the fastest, but I worked hard and constantly tried to make the right decision even if it took more time. Also, why the hell would my old boss want me to continue to work for her if I am literally in the group of 5% stupid employees. Anyway, like I said, the low pay increase doesn't bother me that much since I already had my big bump. The thing that makes my blood boil is that this notch on my employee record will stay there forever, even if I changed job in the same company.\n\n\n\nPetty me:\nI really don't know what my old Boss was thinking by doing this since I am still piloting 2 of the 4 or 5 projects I kept under my belt to soften the blow of me leaving her team. These two last projects are on the verge of being closed up, 3 people out of 4 gave me the go for approbation and the fourth person wants me to clarify a technicality in my report. To be clear, I can't, and I wouldn't destroy any work I already did on these projects because it would be highly unethical, and maybe even illegal. However, I can refuse to sign a document because I am not comfortable to do so, especially if I am not confident with my skills on a subject. Sooooooooooooooo... I am now not confident in anything I did since I'm an underachiever, so I removed my name as an author to all ongoing documents. At this moment I am waiting to see what she'll do to complete these projects",

        "text": "Years ago I worked for a state agency that saw me drive in different directions every day. The contract went through a regional agency but I worked directly for the state, per the contract. As such, the director of the regional agency was not my boss and his only responsibility was to make sure I got my paycheck, including expenses. Things went swimmingly for the first year until the director retired and they moved the deputy director, who was a known micromanaging d-bag, into his slot. Well, the new director started trying to give me orders, to which I said, \"Umm...yeah, no. Doesn't work that way - read the contract.” This pissed him off to no end, as I had my office in the building and I was the only person he couldn't say boo to. Plus, I was really good at my job and the state was very pleased with how things were going. Thus, no entertaining contract renegotiating with the regional agency. \n\nWell, my job was pretty dynamic insomuch as I'd be blowing in and out all day and every time I saw the new regional director, he'd glare at me. When we were in meetings together, he'd seethe if I took the floor and explained what was going on in the field. This was necessary information that everybody in the meeting needed, so he just had to take it. I could tell he was calculating a way to gain some leverage over me. I'm chuckling now thinking about how much I innocently pissed this dude off. At any rate, somewhere along the line he realized he had to sign off on my expenses and decided to take a deep dive into them. So one day, he shows up at my office and says, \"You need to come with me.\" I'm a little taken aback and decide, \"WTH, just follow this guy and see what he wants.\" He ushers me into his office and tells me to have a seat - and leaves his office door open so that everybody in the vicinity can hear what's about to happen.\n\nHe has my expenses for the past month spread across his desk. \"You're saying you went from A to B and that's how many miles you drove? Then from C to D and E and back to C?\" He said it loudly, basically accusing me of padding my miles, so theft. So I flip my shit right there. \"You're calling me a LIAR???\" I bellowed. He did not expect that. Frankly, neither did I. I was just so furious that anyone would suggest I’d do such a thing. So I said, “Wait right here” and stormed out to my jeep and grabbed my gazetteer (this was five years before Google Maps was a thing), stomped back to his office – by now everyone was tuned it – and slapped it down on his desk. Then I proceeded to show him how I use back roads to save tons of time. He maintained that that was not appropriate and I should go the direct route and it would be faster anyway. I was through with his shit at that point and said, “Take it up with my supervisor” – a guy he would never fuck with. We left it at that and, if memory serves, never spoke another word to each other.\n\nCue accidental revenge. There was a meeting on the seacoast, an hour or so away, and we both needed to be there and it happened that we got into our respective vehicles at the same time.  He was travelling with a coworker, whom I liked. He pulled out ahead of me and I basically followed him for about ten minutes and then hit the back roads that, by this point, I knew like the locals. When they finally arrived, I asked his coworker, “Ohh, did you guys stop for gas or something.” “No straight through. Why, how long have you been here?” I smiled, looking at the regional director and said, “Fifteen minutes.”",

        "text": " \n\nI  (37 F) am a photographer who specializes in creative  portraiture and have been fortunate to be pretty successful in my career. \n\nIn  early 2021 I worked with a local burlesque performer (who I fill refer to as Jane) and we hit it off really well. We had several mutual friends  and acquaintances and by the end of the shoot wondered how we had gone  this long without working with one another. The photos turned out  beautiful and once they had been edited I had shared them to a local  networking group for models and photographers. This particular group was  created by a friend of mine, specifically for AFAB (assigned female at  birth) people and trans women to have a safe place to come to and  network on projects, work, etc.\n\nThe  photos went over really well, until someone new to the group (who I  will call Natalie) decided to start making negative comments about my  model Jane. In short, she began to slut shame Jane and went on for a  good bit about some nonsense involving a boy they both knew. Overall, it  was just really inappropriate and unnecessary commentary that really  shouldn't have been part of a group centered around modeling,  photography, hair and makeup.  I made a point of replying to this person  and telling them in no uncertain terms that their rantings had no place  in the group and that their personal beef with the model really  shouldn't be a topic of discussion in the photography group. There was a  little bit of back in forth, with Natalie increasingly throwing insults  at me, which I took with a grain of salt, before the admin of the group  stepped in an removed her from the group.\n\nI  did not know this at the time, but the only reason Natalie had been  added to the group, is because she had runway experience and the group  was hosting a workshop for members that were interested. After this  incident, Natalie was fired from the workshop. I didn't really think  much of the whole situation after that until my bestie messaged me,  asking how I knew Natalie. I told her I didn't and gave her a rundown of  the previous situation. Apparently Natalie had taken the time to  dedicate an insanely long social media post about myself and Jane. Specifically  how she was going to make sure I never got any work in our city again and that I was just a big ole C U Next Tuesday. Honestly, I had a pretty  good laugh about it.\n\nIn  an effort to kinda poke fun at the situation and make a point that this  particular word doesn't bother me in the least, I decided to do some  self portraits where I painted the big ole \"C\" word all over my face  neck and chest. I made funny faces, flipped off the camera, stuck my  tongue out etc. After all was said and done, I made the photo my profile  picture on social media. It blew up. People really gravitated to the  idea of it.  So, I decided to turn it into a special. For the month of  April I would offer a discounted portrait session where the client would  choose a word they feel has affected them in one way or another, have  it painted all over them and in essence reclaim power over that negative  word. They could do it however they felt they needed to. If they needed  to be mad, get mad. If they needed to cry, cry. If they wanted to make  funny faces, have at it. I'm here for it all. One thing I have always  striven for as a photographer is creating a safe and welcoming  environment for anyone who comes to my studio.\n\nWell, it blew up and I suddenly found myself overbooked for April and  many more messaging me wanting to participate. So, I decided to extend  the special and just see what happens. Everyone had their own story  behind these words and honestly, with some, it took everything in me not  to break down bawling right then and there. It's amazing how much power  one singular word can hold over us. Some people have been carrying this  weight for decades and it turned out to be an incredibly cathartic  experience for several people. It was also gaining a fair amount of  attention on social media. People were responding really well to the message behind it.\n\nSometime  in May, a local news publication reached out and asked if I'd be  willing to talk about the series. I agreed and answered some questions,  told a relatively condensed version of what sparked the series etc. This  was followed by two other publications reaching out, interested in the  story.  I decided at that time to talk with a local gallery that I have a  close relationship with, about setting up a solo exhibit later in the  year and they were really excited about it. We decided to set it up for  early Sept and it would run for two weeks in the gallery and I got to  work setting up an opening night event. I also asked that those who were  comfortable doing so, share the story behind their word, where it would  be placed next to their photo in the gallery.\n\nFor  opening night, I was able to gather some of the best local performers  so we could do a show in conjunction with the gallery event. It was an  incredible, diverse cast of burlesque, sideshow and drag performers,  including Jane, who had also participated in the photo series. We  actually bonded over the whole situation and are now very close friends.  The show drew in a crowd of more than 200 people, before the gallery had to cut off ticket sales and we were at capacity for Covid social  distancing purposes. For the second half of the show, each performer did  a piece in relation to the whole theme of the series. A portion of all  sales went to a local organization for at risk teens and young adults in  the LGBTQ+ and allied communities that has a large focus on mental  health. I was called on stage a couple of times where I babbled  incoherently for a little while before shakily handing the mic back to  the hosts of the show and scuttling off stage like the neurotic goblin I  am. Public speaking is not my strong suit.\n\nFor the exhibit itself, as people walk through the gallery, they see the negative words and the  stories behind them. The name of the series is called Sticks and Stones  and in the center of the main room I had smooth river stones where  people could write their own negative word on one side of the stone and carry it with them through the rest of the exhibit. I was a bit busy  with helping backstage, so I wasn't able to really see any reactions  first hand, but I was told by a few people that the reactions were very  positive, with some attendees having an emotional reaction. And then  there was the final room.\n\nNow,  what the gallery attendees were not aware of was that there was a  second part to the series. In fact, even the participants weren't aware  until they arrived at my studio for their shoot. I also made a point of  making sure it was kept hush hush for the time being. After doing photos  with their negative word, they would choose a positive word that they  would like to replace it with. We would pick a spot on their face, neck, or chest to wipe away part of the negative word and paint on the  positive word in bright red paint. In the final room the walls were  covered with the positive word photos. Smiling faces of the participants  taking power back over these words that had held so much power over  them for so long. There was also another table with red sharpies, where  attendees could write their own positive word on the other side of the  rock and they could choose to take the stone with them, or leave it in a  basket on the table. I still have the stones people left with their own  words on it and keep it in a special place in my home. I've been told  by several people who attended that they decided to keep their stone as a  memento of the show. I also had a great surprise while at a convention in the next state over, where one of the attendees I randomly chatted with had seen my series and she also happened to be from an entirely different country.  It was truly one of those \"small world\" situations. \n\nFrom  April to Sept of 2021, roughly 80 people participated in the photo  series and it is the highlight of my career as a photographer thus far.  My clientele base has expanded and I have a great reputation as a  photographer in my city. All because someone tried to slut shame my model turned friend and called me the \"C\" word while vowing to ruin my  career and reputation as a photographer. I have never been busier and to  my knowledge, \"Natalie\" hasn't been able to find any modeling work since.",

He also does this in the shower, leaving little globs of snot on the bottom of the tub.\n\nI've asked him several times to stop or at least clean it up. He doesn't listen. Tells me if I have a problem with it to clean it up myself.\n\nSo I've been using his toothbrush to clean up his loogies. I don't wash it off afterward, I just run a piece of toilet paper over it to make it look clean.

Bryan was a decent room mate up until his girlfriend broke up with him. At that point he got fired from his job, and he began slacking on bills and rent. Every time a bill or the beginning of the month turned up, I'd have to cover it and he would always claim to get me back later. He would even steal my food. He never asked permission to eat something of mine. He never did chores and he blasted music. I tried to empathize and reason with him, but nothing ever changed. \n\nWell one day I learned he had been texting underage girls. I lost it. I demanded he move out but he refused. I tried talking to my landlord but he said he couldn't kick him out unless he agreed to sign off the lease. So from that point on I started removing things from the house that he didn't pay for like food, laundry detergent, towels, and toilet paper. I tried everything possible to make him want to leave. I even disconnected the WIFI.\n\nOne day he went to the bathroom while I was at work. #2 to be specific. He didn't have toilet paper. He went and used paper towels which caused him to clog the toilet and leave it for me to discover later when I needed to go #2.  I had to go! I went ahead and unclogged the toilet, did my business, then took the plunger and covered it with my poo. I went to his room and threw the plunger on to his bed. i may have rolled it around a little bit too.\n\nfunny thing is he put the plunger on my door, but he never cleaned his sheets. He probably thought it was his own poo. I just got fed up with him persisting to stay and having to live in misery. The kind of misery where I had to plunge the poop of a person like him.",

I came through a contract, let’s call my direct employer, BigA.\n\nBigA observed more holidays than Horizon, so per our contract we had to work those days for Horizon and then could use them towards PTO later. \nAt the end of the year I had a 12 day trip planned that was a pretty big deal. I was ready to quit if my Horizon boss didn’t approve, but he had no issues.\n\nI used all my saved up PTO, followed the instructions from BigA’s HR to get the codes for using those holiday days towards PTO so I don’t have to take as many unpaid days.\n\nHorizon boss sends the confirmation that I did work those days. I forward to my BigA manager, for his confirmation as well so I can forward to HR. BigA manager says “assume you didn’t work those days and we’re good here.”\n\nI was 22, it was my first big job, and people were easily replaceable. I was super pissed but too scared to tell HR.\n\nFast forward to the next calendar year. Was taking a weekend trip for a family wedding and needed the Friday off. The procedure was to email the request to my Horizon boss and CC BigA manager, then put the hours in the BigA timesheet portal accordingly.\n\nI “forgot” to cc BigA manager, and figured if Horizon boss cared enough he’d cc him in his own response. He didn’t notice and gave me the approval. So off I went on my trip without BigA knowing I had taken the day off. Clocked the hours and let BigA “assume I worked those days.”\n\nAnd did so for every other day I took off for the next year until I left Horizon. Got paid prorated for my saved up PTO by BigA.\n\nPetty maybe isn’t the word for the revenge, but revenge nonetheless.",

I had never seen them and they had influenced my life so much so I dropped around 3k on a credit card, took time off work and traveled half across the country to see them without blinking an eye. I was so excited, and my boyfriend was so excited for me. We got to the venue super early and stood out front so we could be near the stage and we were. What I didnt expect was that quite a few people there were really against a straight couple being there ( their own inaccurate assumptions...even though it should not be an issue either way it even funnier that they were wrong) I was the main target, apparantly I had  betrayed my gender by being straight ( ha) and bringing my sins to this show and they were not shy about letting me know.   I was trying to have a good time but a few of these people were really making it hard. The show was getting pretty rowdy and being so close to the front I could see security pulling people out of the crowd and through a side door toward flashing blue lights and I wanted no part of that so I ignored alot of insults, peope saying  I dont know shit about this band, hair pulls, name calling, kicks  etc but this one girl....I guess she figured she was a powerful witch and could get away with anything she wanted. She started pulling my hair and hanging on to my head like I was Rapunzel and trying to choke me. She was trying to leg sweep me and pull me to the ground. She was saying things like \"I am not of this world\" and \"I will end you\"  It was relentless. Im really strong so I was able to hold my own without throwing a punch and getting arrested but finally, I just didnt wanna be there anymore. The show was still about 30 minutes from over and I wanted to leave, but I didnt want to leave defeated. So when she grabbed my hair again ( maybe the 20th time) instead of pulling away I twisted into her, my face was right near her chest and she was wearing a very low tank top. I grabbed her around the arms and waist with one arm while I stuck the fingers of my other hand down my throat to make myself vomit right down the front of her shirt while I looked into her eyes. I was pretty dehydrated from being there for so long so there was quite a bit of dry heaving before I was able to produce. The look of horror in her eyes told me I won this fight. She was too shocked and disgusted to react instantly so I stood straight up smiled and shoved her toward the front, propelling my self away from the stage to make my exit. I wrote a cool song about it later that I had fun playing at a lot of shows.  So even though the show was really disappointing in a lot of ways, at least I got a hilarious memory and a cool song so it wasnt a waste of money or time. A weird win, but a win.",

        "text": "So I went to visit my mum yesterday and she told me this story.\n\nMy brother (9m) likes to play with other boys on the block, they usually play soccer or bike races outside and Fortnite or FIFA 22 online, all this during the afternoons/evenings after they're done with homework. They can be pretty loud, but they're ages 8-12. \n\nThe neighborhood my mum lives in has something similar to an HOA (they have a representative and they have to pay fees, mostly for security and surveillance even though it's very safe) and the rep is friends with my grandma who also lives there. \n\nSo on a Thursday the rep calls my mom to tell her that someone complained that the kids were being too loud and it was too late for them to be alone outside, mind you it was like 7:30pm, they don't have school the next day, the street is pretty illuminated and has cameras basically on every light post (also, the neighborhood is pretty much gated all around). My mum calmy told rep to ask the person complaining to call her directly because she was actually outside speaking with the other kids' parents as they were watching them and this is a family-friendly neighborhood. Rep started getting defensive and said that she didn't want to cause conflicts and making up excuses and that was that. Later on, rep was chit-chatting with my grandma and said her nephew (who lives a few houses from my mum's) was having trouble with work because \"there's too much noise outside\", so mum knew that he was the one complaining.\n\nThing is, he's basically fresh out of college, which means that he hosts parties from Thursday to Saturday or just blasts his stereo while drinking alone until 4-5 in the morning when he passes out drunk. Kinda hypocritical if you ask me\n\nCue my mum asking the boys to play right in front of his house and yell as loud as they can. My brother's curfew is 8pm so he can get a good night's sleep, but my mum (and the others' parents) extended it to 10pm because they didn't have school the next day anyway. The dude never complained again, but my mum did report him every time his speaker was on after midnight. He eventually stopped except for a party here and there and all was well. The end.",

        "text": "Well here's one. I had a manager in a produce dept I worked. This guy was something else, had been there since he was a young guy, and was \"large and in charge\" and got away with a lot of BS. He was a workplace bully,and really had a target on me, but would also lay it on others, getting the young kids who worked there to be \"{his little slaves, I work 'em hard\" were his words once!\n\nI have many many stories of that department/store I could write a book, but I'll cut to the chase!\n\nOne day, on one of his tirades against management because they told him to do his job, he was venting at me. He was threatening to quit, calling his boss all sorts of nasty, and being a shithead... He says to me, \"I am just going to pull the wrong pallet, and hurt my back! I'[ll get you to fill out the report, and I'm out of here!!\" Now, I was enjoying seeing him melt down, but when he said that, I just went along with him, empathy, sympathy, apathy and all the lip service...\n\nBut, I knew him, his games and I kept what he said in my mind. I also went to the Management upstairs, and asked to be taken off the First Aid duty sheet, I told them that due to all the calls I was handling, I needed a break for a bit, and let the younger guys get some action.. (I was Level 3 with experience, so everyone would bypass other F.A.'s who had Level 1 and call me... which really pissed my manager off!! (Produce manager would come down to first aid room, barge in and demand I get back to the floor, all while I'm wrapping a cut hand from Deli dept).\n\nNow, being off the roster meant that I was under no obligation to render any aid, and I couldn't tell the big boss about his plan, because the boss would not back me up.... If it was any catastrophe, or serious injury I would jump in regardless of roster status. I'm a jerk, not an A-hole!\n\nSome months after, I came in for my closing shift, around noon. Mr manager comes to me, all sad and doe-eyed...\"I hurt my back this morning, and I need your help, can you write up a report!\"...He tells me that he (surprise!!) pulled a pallet, and hurt his back.. at 7:30 that morning. A golden gift was given to me that day!! I told him I was sorry, I was off the duty roster, and he would need to call one of the other attendants...Also, I reminded him that he should have reported it right after it happened, and that could influence a denial of any claims!!!!\n\nWell, I heard him sputter, and I saw that look on his face... I can't describe it, but it was like he had been deflated...utterly deflated that he couldn't get a visit from the \"compensation fairy\"!!! I had a great rest of day, and down the road I would make subtle remarks of how it was a shame he still had to come in to work!!!\n\nIt was a shame to have to be so underhanded and sneaky, but that was the way it was in that small town. The only grocery store too, so kinda hard to get \"true justice\"!! Had I done what he wanted, I could have lost my certification, gotten fired, and maybe even charged... This guy really wanted to cause me trouble, so I had to always cover my ass, and our big boss didn't care about anything except a cheeseburger...\n\nI know this has been long winded, my first real post, but I greatly enjoyed that moment, and will remember it with a smile!\n\nI was told that this was in the wrong sub...So I moved it here, and did a bit of editing...Posted to other sub too",

        "text": "So tbh not the best story on this sub but it's mine.\n\nSo this happened about over a year ago now. But I used to live with my abusive/neglectful Mother who has BPD and co-dependence issues . As such It's been my job sense I was like 9 to take care of her, my little brother, and dog.\n\nBy time I was 12 I completely gave up on life and thought it was a mislabel hell hole. In 2019 my mom moved us Me {16f} and {15m} into a hotel room and shoved everything we owned into a storage. Due to bad planning we moved by ourselves (me and brother) the whole apartment in a hurricane. We only had 3 days to do it, but the apparent let us stay another 3 out of pity. Lots of yelling and exestuation later we arrive to the hotel. \n\nTurns out me and my bro didn't pack toothbrushes in our suitcases. Out if 1) panic and 2) Being told that we were only going to stay for 3 days. It ended up being 6 months!\n\nAt some point my little bro was done! He and my mom got into a massive drag out fight. He then moved out with my dad and he basically had to leave everything but the clothes on his back.. I stayed longer under the illusion that things could change if I put in enough love. \n\nAfter I turn 17 tho I decided that enough was enough and decided to move in with my dad too. Now for the petty part. I promised to stay in till I was 18. But I had a plan: I was going to take as much stuff with me as I could. \n\nSo I started to funnel as much stuff to my dad and bro as I  could.  I took movies and things my bother couldn't take with him.  Things I wasn't supposed to take but did anyway. Tbh she'll probably never notice as she was/still is a hoarder and has like 3 storages worth of stuff.  But I grabbed those movies and as much stuff for my brothers I could. \n\nAnd as petty and insignificant as it was I'm proud of it. I have that movie collection still. It's out in the open and she's come over but she never noticed it.",

On the night I moved in the power was out for a repair. I was showing my then fiance the place with my phone flashlight. My neighbor then stood outside the door with a gun waiting for us to come out. He thought we were homeless. He tried to be nice at first but in a really creepy way. He would watch me shovel the snow and comment and how petite my roommate and I are (I definitely am not). He would ask my then fiance which one of us he had sex with. Our neighbor would also complain about the criminals that our other neighbors had over. (They are just bikers and not white) Eventually he got upset that we fed the birds and called code enforcement saying we had a nice infestation. We gladly let an inspector come and see that there was not a problem. He has called our landlord several times to complain about random stuff. This include the snow on the sidewalk that we didn't shovel when we were out of town. One of the craziest things he did was pound on our door yelling at us when the garbage truck missed his can. He wants us to move out. \n\nToday, I have reached a breaking point. My roommates fiance was over and briefly parked in front of his house. The neighbor doesn't even park there. He then stood by their car until my roommate and her fiance went to leave and screamed and cussed them out.\n\nWe have had to call the cops once, so if he comes to our property again they can arrest him for trespassing. How else can I get this guy to leave us alone? I'm all if a little (or alot) pettiness.",

        "text": "I needed to run to an outdoor shopping center on my lunch break the other day for some things. A couple years ago an In-N-Out was put in which was a big deal here and the lines were of course insane. Even now they will spill out onto the streets. Ever since they opened though, In-N-Out has had an established way to enter the line with cars waiting in the center lane to turn left to prevent people from holding up traffic by just stopping to turn right or to try to drive straight across traffic from the other side of the street, which is where I was shopping.\n\nAs I’m getting in my car I see an unusually long line down at the stop sign. Now, this shopping center has heavily designed traffic directions and you need to pick the right one to make sure you’re not forced into leaving the wrong direction at the exits. So I had to go up and wait. \n\nSomehow the car at the front is still there but now there’s only 2 cars behind them. As I pull up the SUV directly behind pulls up onto the curb to go around the front car and then the next one back turns around to find another way.\n\nI’m unsure what’s happening so I pull up and see that directly across from us the In-N-Out line has reached the street, there are cars to my left in the left turn lane lining up as they are accustomed to, waiting to turn into the driveway when there’s room to do so, and then there is this piece of shit in front of me. Kids in the back, passenger in the front, their elbow resting on their door as if they have all the time in the world and are completely oblivious to the traffic jam they are causing.\n\nI’m baffled and can feel the rage in my chest start to spread up the back of my neck. I am waiting for over a minute as all these openings in traffic come and go and still they do not move or even seek to be paying attention. I cannot believe someone could be such a self centered prick to continue to casually sit and wait when there is obviously not a way for them to cross as there is already a long line waiting and traffic is fairly busy in both directions. Just completely oblivious to the cars behind them struggling to find a way out of the situation.\n\nI’m too close to pull out, there are cars behind me blocking me in, and I’m also just not about letting this assclown keep this up. I’m sure my dash cam caught some really obnoxious  “are you serious!???’s” and “MOVE your ASS!’s” from me in that moment.\n\nI could see the lady at the front of the line looking over at them making a face similar to how I was feeling and from what I could see looking through their back windshield, they were posted up and very comfortable trying to wait it out until someone felt forced to let them cut ahead of them in line. \n\nI resorted to the only thing I could do, short of getting out of my car and embarrassing myself worse. I laid on the horn and I didn’t let off. It was so loud and unending and it was actually not easy to keep it going longer than a few seconds without letting off. If you’re ever in this situation be prepared to keep a lot of even pressure on that bitch and use two hands. \n\nWe are right in front of a Chipotle, there’s shoppers and cars and businesses all over on either side during the lunch hour. Everyone is stopping and their heads are turning, the people waiting in their cars for In-N-Out are all staring at the lead car now and some are laughing. I’m still seeing red.\n\nAfter about *12 seconds*… which is an absolute eternity when you’re drawing so much annoying attention to yourself, I see the driver in front of me start to panic looking all around and suddenly turn their blinker on and pull out to find the end of the line and drive off. I see a couple smiles as I turn the other way to leave but I’m too tunnel visioned to enjoy any embarrassment that might have finally occurred to them. \n\nMoral of the story: don’t be the guy stuck waiting for someone else to get their head out of their ass. It’s probably not gonna happen organically",

        "text": "When I started baking and selling cookies, I had a customer, “Karen”, who ordered x30 cookies. \n\nShe wanted 2 designs : x15 to be bowties and the other x15 to be in the shape of a 1.\n\nAfter working hard on them and being pretty pleased with how they turned out, I packaged them in a box and placed a tiny 3cm sticker on the lid with the wording “thank you” on it. \n\nKaren collected and then messaged me later saying how displeased she was with half the designs. I was confused and asked her why, to which she explained she didn’t like how it looked and she overdramatized the whole thing saying it was so bad she couldn’t give them to KIDS. She tried accusing me of scamming her because I gave her the box with a sticker that ‘sealed’ the lid so she couldn’t open and see them. Smh. \n\nI was quite hurt but I apologized and offered a refund, but she wanted me to remake half the order and send it to her within a *few hours*. I politely explained to her that I could only do the refund and she said she will come and collect the refund and return half the order.\nShe sent her husband to collect the money instead.\nShe did not return half the order. \nI had to call her to ask her about the cookies because she wasnt answering her messages and she explained that she was busy making a cake and would return the cookies the next morning.\n\nI told her it was alright and that she could keep the cookies and again apologised for the disappointment and hope she enjoys the cookies regardless. She felt very shameful and apologies for her behaviour and mentioned that her drama was not necessary. \n**Blocked**",

        "text": "I was a quiet kid and rather shy back in the day, especially in primary school. I was still somehow friends with the popular girls but after a few years of friendship one of the girls started to bully me even when the other girls stood up for me. She was blatantly obvious in her dislike. (SIDE BAR:- I was also one of the only darker skinned kids in the school as I’m Filipino Australian and the girls were very White), she called me all sorts of things and tried to exclude me from group activities. She called me chocolate once and to this day I still don’t understand how that’s an insult when most folks love chocolate.\n\nHere’s my very simple and petty revenge…\n\nWhen I got my license at 18 years old, after having had my learners permit for 2 years - my sister wanted me to drive her to the local Macca’s ‘cause that’s all she could think to go once I got my license. We ordered food, paid and went to drive to pick up… lo and behold, it’s my bully at the third window! She doesn’t recognise me but I sure as fuck recognise her even though there was a huge noticeable change to her. She very bubbly informing me that it’ll be a while and to park at the bay and she’ll take the food to the us once it’s ready.\n\nMy kid sister and I were waiting for a few minutes when I see her approaching the car and very happily says, “Here’s your order guys… I’m so sorry about the wait!” \n\nI would often tell the worker it’s no worries, i’m happy to wait as I’m not an arsehole to hospitality workers, and hate seeing when others are; but this was just the perfect chance to get back at my bully. Instead of thanking her, I replied, “don’t worry, *Nat*, you’ll lose it!” Her face went through all the motions… “how does she know my name? Why is she talking about my weight? I’m going to cry. OMG, I KNOW HER!”\n\nWhen I saw the recognition on her face, I told her it was great to see her again and drove off with a smile on my face.",

        "text": "Okay so I don’t use this app often so idk the censorship rules. So excused the title. Also not as cool as everyone else’s stories on here so I’m sorry lol. \n\nAnyways i’m 20 years old and this is my first apartment. when I first moved in here the upstairs neighbors were really quiet. I knew they were up there because I heard them have sex the first night I was here and the name on the mailbox never changed so I’m assuming that maybe someone moved in or something. Around April the stomping began. I kept quiet about it bc I was thinking maybe it was kids or a dog but nope it’s a 50 year old man stomping like that. So I started taking videos and I complained to the landlord and her lazy ass didn’t say anything so it continued. I started growing more and more irritated bc it would happen while I’m doing homework, during online job interviews, when I had migraines, I had a friend over, and when I was trying to make an audition tape for this job at the local theater as apart of the ensemble (I didn’t submit it bc of the stomping in the background). I started banging my broom and playing loud music but I don’t want to annoy my other neighbors so I decided to write a letter. \n\nI was anxious bc I don’t like confrontation but this was the last thing I could do before I go absolutely berserk bc this time they woke me up at 3 am and it took me a while to be able to go back to sleep at 5 am. I admit it did sound very passive aggressive, but in my defense I was running off of five hours sleep because they woke me up again at 7 AM and I couldn’t go back to sleep. They still stomp. So I decided to wait. I didn’t know exactly when was going to be a good time but I was going to wait. I prayed that the guy would stub his toe in the meantime and tonight I got my chance. \n\nI got up to use the bathroom and passed by my bedroom and heard some squeaking. I put my ear up to the wall to make sure it was my upstairs neighbors and not the ones next to me. It was. So I took my phone and played the first non sexy song (Sign of the Times by Harry Styles) I saw and got on my bed and started banging on the ceiling with my phone pressed against the ceiling singing to the top of my lungs all 5 mins and 41 seconds. It was the best 5 mins and 41 seconds of my life. The best part of all of this is they haven’t had sex in MONTHS! So yeah no happy ending for him tonight. I feel bad for the lady but he really only last 10 minutes so it wouldn’t be any different for her. \n\nI felt like these would be important details. Yes I’m 20 but very anti social. The only people who come over are my 2 friends and it’s never at the same time. So with that being said I don’t have parties I am the only black person living in this part of our building and I don’t like to draw attention to myself. My tv volume is never over 20 and the only time I blast music is when I’m in the shower and washing dishes and then I turn it down when Im done. I come from a very quiet home, it’s so quiet I feel like I have to whisper. I learnt to respect older people and I don’t really like doing any of this but the guy is racist as well as a stomper. So no I swear I’m not loud and I’ve never received any complaints except that one time when there was a 🍃 smell coming from my apartment months prior and that was the only time. Im a social smoker.",

        "text": "This was a long time ago but I remember it like it was yesterday. I worked in the regional branch of a bank and was in loans. The district manager had to move the head lender into our branch for observation because he had four processors quit on him within six months. So I was number five. This guy was HATED at our bank… he treated fellow workers incredibly disrespectfully and was a flaming racist ( one of his rants… not kidding) was that the bleeping Jews stole Passover from the Christian’s). So also not so bright.\n\nWell my district manager ended up loving him and he lived to drive me crazy. \n\nOne day he had this obnoxious singing tie that he played. I obviously cringed so he decided to play it over. And over. And over. In between customers. In between phone calls.  And smiled huge because he knew I was absolutely silently seething. So I finally decided I had enough. I told him if he could go the rest of the day without playing it? I would buy him a case of literally any case of beer of his  choosing. Anything.\n\nHe immediately jumped on it and then spent the rest of the day musing out loud about what the most expensive beer was…max number of bottles… all the different ways he could gouge me the most… while laughing like it was the funniest thing ever. I silently took it and didn’t say a single word… no matter how outrageous his comments.  His constant… constant at my expense comments. After six and a half straight hours of this.. the clock finally hit end of day. \n\nAt that point he jumped up and started telling me what he had decided his beer of choice would be. \n\nTo which I replied… “ April’s Fools”. \n\nTo say he was angry is an understatement. He didn’t speak to me for a month. ( which was awesome). The district manager was equally enraged. Everyone else high fived me for weeks… \n\nI ended up quitting not too long after but I will admit it was sooo satisfying.  Petty? Yes. But so deserved.",

As I pull in, I see that the pump is still in the gas tank, the clip thing has disengaged so that automatic pumping has stopped and there's no one to be seen. Maybe they stepped inside for a receipt or a lotto ticket. Ok whatever. Dude casually strolls over whilst on his phone like he's the CEO of the gas station, not a worry in the world. He leisurely returns the pump, secures his gas cap and I'm all like \"great, let's get this going.\" Instead of entering his car to gtfo, he then proceeds to walk past my car...to the sidewalk...to the intersection...WHERE HE PROCEEDS TO CROSS AND GO INTO THE FUCKING CANNABIS STORE!!! WTF!!!?!? \n\nI'm flabbergasted and can barely process what I'm seeing, when I turn back and catch the eyes of the woman pumping on the other side of our lane. We both have BIG WTF-DID-WE-JUST-WITNESS EYES as I roll my window down and she totally confirmed it, DUDE WENT TO THE WEED STORE WITHOUT MOVING HIS EFFING VEHICLE FROM THE LANE. (WHO IN THE FUCKING FUCK DOES THAT??!?! UGHHH!!!)  The lady was done, she advised I pull in behind her so I could do my thing and can get on with my life. \n\nSo I'm pumping my gas and FUMING at the audacity of this I'm-the-main-character dude. I considered spitting on his car (ew), in my head I rehearsed my speech of shame upon his return, I thought about leaving a note, I considered all the things. As I finished pumping my gas, dude is still no where to be seen I did the only thing I could think of in those final moments; I put the flosspick that I had been using to dislodge my breakfast from my teeth and jammed it between the window and the door on the driver's side. I felt that it wasn't destructive or as gross as spitting (maybe only eversoslightly less gross anyway), he would find it immediately (it was bright green) and most importantly, I would feel better. \n\nI pulled out before he landed at his car so I didn't see his reaction but I definitely felt better after my petty revenge. Then I drove like a bat outta hell so he couldn't catch up to me. \n\nMoral of this story: DON'T BE A DICK",

        "text": "So right before Black Friday last year, I ordered a center channel speaker from a website that used to have a very good reputation, but has since been bought by a foreign company and is now still riding on the old reputation, but from what I’ve read (and experienced) has awful customer service.  The speaker was $349 when I bought it, but there was a special logo on the page that stated that if the price went down for Black Friday, I would receive the difference in price.  I was feeling trigger happy so I bought the speaker.  Sure enough, a couple of days later, the price went down to $199.  \n\nI clicked on the customer service page to see what I needed to do to get my partial refund, and the site stated that it would happen automatically, but it might take 4-6 weeks for the money to be refunded.  With the holidays coming up, and my adhd flaring, I decided to do nothing and wait for my money to eventually come back.  I’ve checked every week or so since then, but no refund has been issued.  Today I was dealing with a bunch of other stuff and in the mood to get stuff done, so I decided to contact customer support and figure out where my $150 was.  I was told by the chat rep that there was nothing they could do, because their policy was that you had to request a refund within 14 days in order to price match.  I looked on their site, and while that is the current stated policy, I am sure of what I read before, that they said they would automatically refund my money, but that it would take longer than 14 days.  I did what I was told to do, and got screwed because of it.  Or so they wanted me to believe.  \n\nTurns out there are two things working in my favor.  Number one, they have an extended return period for the holiday season, so while I have been enjoying my speaker for the better part of almost 3 months now, I still have a full 11 days of time left to send it back and get a full refund.  I decide I’m definitely doing that, even though I’m happy with the speaker and annoyed at the prospect of having to cram it back in the box with all the styrofoam and packaging materials.  I’ll just return it and buy something else, or maybe even the same speaker from a different site.  I go and check google to see if there are any current sales and…yep.  Turns out the site I bought it for actually is selling it for $195.  With free shipping.  \n\nHmmm….So you’re telling me I can order another speaker for $155 less than I paid for the other one, have it delivered in 4 days, and then start a return for the first one and get my money back AND you have to pay for the shipping cost of a 40 lb speaker both ways across the United States?  Yep, should have just gave me back my $150, because this is gonna cost you a little extra, plus shipping.  Twice.  Also, I don’t have to hassle with boxing up my old speaker, I can just send them back the 2nd one and they’ll never be able to tell the difference.  If I’m feeling extra petty, I might just cut open the new box so they won’t be able to sell it as unopened.  We’ll see how I’m feeling when it gets here.",

        "text": "This happened nearly a year ago, but it still brings a smile to my face when I remember it.\n\nI had just given my mother a lift to the train station. Just to give you all a bit of context: the entrance to this station is right on the road and there is no space to pull up outside without blocking the traffic, so if you want to drop someone off at the station you have to come off the road and drive into the entrance of the station's car park. The little stretch of road between the main road and the car park of entrance is wide enough that not only can you stop there to let someone out without blocking cars coming in or out of the car park, but also wide enough to allow you to turn around and go back to the main road without having to go into the car park. If you do go into the car park, you have to go the whole way around to get to the exit again.\n\nAnyway, I had stopped just outside the car park to let my mother out of the car when a red sports car comes in from the main road and drives up (quite fast) so that it's right behind my car. The driver then proceeds to honk his horn and I figure that he wants to go into the car park so I reach my arm out the window and signal at him to go past (FYI I already had my hazard lights on). He continues to honk at me. There is no one behind him and there's enough space behind him that if he were to reverse a little, he would have enough space to go around me. There is also no one coming from the opposite direction, although even if there were he would still have space to go around me.\n\nSo I tell my mother to get out quickly and we say a quick goodbye, so that I can get out of this guy's way. This guy is so close to me, however, that I cannot turn around without making a several-point turn to do so, which would take ages and block traffic in both directions. So instead I drive forward into the car park and drive all around it to get back to the exit.\n\nAs I go into the car park I notice he wasn't following me, although he had stopped honking. As I come out again I see him still parking there, but there is another person getting into his car. So he didn't want to get into the car park, he just wanted to stop where I had stopped. Now, he could have easily picked up someone from where he had previously been, and the person he was picking up didn't need help getting into the car. So why did he honk like that? Who knows, but I was feeling annoyed with him for honking like that and being so rude.\n\nSo I drive past and towards the road, waiting for a gap to pull out. As I am waiting, I see the red sports car turn around and come up behind me again. I can also see from his indicators that he wants to go in the same direction as me. I see my opportunity for revenge...\n\nI eventually pull out into the main road when a large gap becomes available (I let a few smaller spaces go past) and the red sports car follows me out, and is the car immediately behind me. Now, the road in question has a speed limit of 40mph. However, there are no speed cameras on the road and no one walks along that bit of it, so people usually drive a bit faster than the limit (nothing crazy, maximum 50ish mph). Today, however, I am feeling particularly law-abiding, so I decide to drive at around 30mph. The guy in the red sports car immediately starts honking again, but this time I decide to ignore him. And as my luck would have it, there is a steady stream of cars coming in the other direction, so he cannot overtake. I slow down to 25mph, then 20. I can see in my rearview mirror the guy in the red sports car has his head out of the window and is clearly looking into the distance to see how far back the line of cars coming towards us goes. Eventually the stream of cars fades out and there is no one coming in the other direction. The red sports car indicates and begins to pull out so that he can overtake me.\n\nThat's when I put my foot down on the accelerator and speed up.\n\nThe red sports car is driving down the middle of the road for a few seconds as the driver tries to work out if he has enough time to overtake me, as I am now a good 100 metres away. He decides against it as another car coming towards us appears ahead and he swerves back into our lane. I immediately put my foot on the break and the speedometer drops down to 60 to 25 mph pretty quickly.\n\nThe stretch of road between the station and where I turn off to go home is about 4-5 miles and usually takes less than 10 minutes to cover, but on this day it took almost 15 minutes. For the rest of the journey, the red sports car drove very close to the middle of the road, had his indicators on and kept trying to pull out so he could overtake me. And every time (I think it happened 4 times in total), I would accelerate as soon as he had the space to overtake. When did eventually turn off the road, I could see the red sports car go whizzing past me, finally free to go at his own choice of speed.\n\nI know it was petty as hell, but I have no regrets and given the chance, I would do the exact same thing again.",

        "text": "I got an option to buy a house but still had until June on my apartment. When I gave notice, I shorted the notice (60 days required), figuring they could turn over and rent the apartment sooner. Then I asked if they could give me a break on that 27 days or on the lease buyout, which was in the contract I signed. After being a long-time resident 6 years total, They said, \"Sorry, nothing we can do. If we did it for you, we would have to do it for everyone.\"\nSo I have 30 days to pay the equivalent of 3 months' worth of rent. \nThe other thing the complex did while I was there that I admit increased the level of petty I'm using is one time a rent check got misplaced in the mail. They hung a pay or vacate notice on my door open face without so much as a call. \nNow the petty. \nUsing the online bill pay at my bank, I will be sending them random check amounts over the next 4 weeks. Ten scheduled so far.\nOn Valentines 3 checks ending in $###.01 $###.02 &amp; $###.04. The missing .03 will be a mental itch that never gets scratched. I figure it will just tie up and irritate the office staff because they will have to manually process each check. And I'm leaving myself enough leeway if a check gets lost in the mail I have time to reissue it.\n\nOpinion; too petty?",

        "text": "It's a long but sweet first petty post.\n\nIt was November in the early 90's and my partner and I started getting phone calls asking if we had the newly released video game console. We would just say that they had a wrong number and hang up. \n\nIt started with one every few days then ramped up to multiple times a day - then we were like, wtf? \n\nSo we looked in the phone book (yep, way before Google) and saw that our phone number was similar to a new chain store that also sold video game consoles. The only difference was that our phone number had a one and theirs had seven. But the way the phone book font was, the serif (the little hook at the edge the digit or letter) made the numbers look similar.\n\nThe number was already printed in the phone book, so we thought we had no recourse.\n\nWe didn't want to be rude to these people who made an honest mistake, so when someone would call asking about the console, we just let them know they had a wrong number and gave the person the correct number to call.\n\nAt this point, everyone had been politely disappointed when they called us, but we gave the correct number, so we never heard from that person again.\n\nQueue to the Kevin (male version of a Karen) calling... again we answered politely saying it's a wrong number and gave the Kevin the correct number, so he hung up. \n\nThen that same Kevin called back a second time, we once again politely said that it was a wrong number but this time it quickly prompted a toddler screaming outburst! He said that we were holding back information and it would be our fault that Christmas was ruined for his kids!!\n\nWe just hung up on him but that made us mad. We finally had enough, so we plotted our revenge.\n\nThe next person that called we said, \"yes, sorry, it is this store, we have those consoles available! If you come right now you'll get $50 off!\" \n\nWe did this over 2 or 3 days. \n\nThen those phone calls stopped.\n\nHeh 😈.",

        "text": "I work in a lovely office, part of a larger organisation. Just before Christmas we were told there would be some refurbishment going on, so we'd have to share with the office next door to us temporarily. No problems, we can work with that.\n\nHowever, as always, there are little things that wind up other folks that aren't used to your work style.\n\nThis other office had a shared \"log\" that they used to update regularly, as in multiple times an hour. They were very used to calling out \"anybody in the log?\" before they went in to update it, as part of their office culture. It didn't bother us to begin with, but after a while it was a little distracting. We asked politely if they'd mind using Slack or Teams or Skype etc - we didn't use a log but we also didn't shout across the office and it was irritating when we were on calls with customers (this other team was internal-facing only) and the customers would hear someone shouting in the background.\n\nThey agreed, but nothing changed. A few times an hour we'd hear \"ANYBODY IN THE LOG?\" shouted by someone on their side of the office.\n\nThis is Petty Revenge; we worked well with these guys and it was just a clash of working cultures. Nobody harboured any ill feelings.\n\nBut, what did we do? Every now and then, we also called out \"OI, WHO'S IN THE LOG?\" and they'd all scrabble to check their computers to see if they were in it.\n\nThis happened a number of times, they knew we were winding them up but they were duty bound to check if they'd left their log open.\n\nIt came to a head one morning, 9am, they're all huddled around the central stand up table for their morning meeting, and someone from our side calls out \"WHO'S LEFT THE LOG OPEN?\"\n\nThey all scatter, check they're not in their log, then reconvene and throw daggers at us, who are laughing. Someone calls out \"dance, puppets\", we enjoy more laughs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR, we wind up some shared office folks.",
