        "text": "Hi All, this seems like a great space! I'm aware this is people's \\[often very expensive\\] time I'm asking for, so thank you in advance. Dimensions are all of course super tentative. I decided to keep as much of this in metric as possible for all the reasons people like metric.\n\nI'm designing a wheelchair for myself, hopefully for others, because more work has been done for dune buggies and for tote goats to make them awesome in the last too many decades than for wheelchairs that would be reachable for the GENERAL public, not a military contractor or a disabled person with an adequately popular crowd fund.  The mediocre/piss-poor CAD and anything I have the executive function to record will be \"open source.\" Definitely DO NOT want to start a business. Definitely WILL overpay a unionized fab shop for the frame work on my own chair.\n\nThere is a British dude in a wheelchair with a website who goes on a pretty good rant about all the completely unnecessary deficiencies in power chairs, but his behavior would definitely violate this sub's rules and alienate a bunch of people, so I won't link him and you'll have to find him on your own. His thoughts in large part powered the ideas to this project. Maybe in the interest of ethics I'll source him in documentation, but with an addendum like \"but personally, \\*\\*\\*\\* you, man. I think \\[unrelated rant\\] and long live \\[rant\\] and free \\[rant\\] and down with \\[more rant content\\].\"\n\nSome of the power and motor and even steering issues are either worked out or close: Rear-drive differential steering that can corner at speed (well... I found a decently reviewed paper documenting this task for robotics with some maths I can put into Python), using Ackerman-style dampers on the front casters to prevent excessive caster shimmy, multi-linkage rear suspension, and a redundant and serviceable battery array, tentatively powering two 750-1000 W, 36 V, brushless hub motors controlled with pulse width modulation. An electrical engineering friend is building the batteries for me.\n\nThe fun/stupid part: I want the wheelbase extendable. And I want to be able to raise and lower the center of gravity.  I'm looking at limiting the whole thing to about 600mm long, to be able to extend out to 850mm or 900mm. The seat I want to give a range between 350mm off the floor, from the bottom of the wheels, to maybe 750mm.\n\nImagine a 'polite, conventional wheelchair' mode, where the thing has the user at 450mm off the floor and the chair at 600mm, and the range of the throttle doesn't go beyond like 15KPH. Then imagine a stupid mode, the wheelbase fully extended and the user as low to the ground as possible. There's more stability so those motors can be better exploited. I've seen enough power scooters going slowly down the sidewalk (or scarier, the road) to the store or whatever to have decided that we need more horsepower.\n\nBrings us to the ***QUESTION*** (in caps because this is a wall of text; sorry): I know I can put a high-torque linear actuator inside a steel rectangular pipe, held at the base by a bolt through the pipe and held at the extending end by a bolt through a larger pipe. You get a telescoping effect. I know there are Drawn over Mandrel options, mostly with aluminum alloys, but I also know you can just grind off the weld seams and the pipes will telescope really nicely. But it needs to be painted because it's going to be in the elements. From a metal fab point of view (if there is anyone reading this who does fabrication), should I plan on just grinding down the smaller tube to the point that a good enough paint job can be applied to it? Are there better ways of telescoping my wheelchair frame?\n\nMaybe it's a lawsuit waiting to happen, but in the short term it is my hobby and I'm using it to cope with eventually needing a power chair. Maybe some fellow foolish disableds can follow me down into this chasm. LOL.",

For example, 2 wires from the positive terminal of my power source to either end of the top plate, and 2 wires from the negative source to either end of the bottom plate. \n\nI understand that a circuit connected to only one side of a terminal will do nothing because there is no potential.difference. does this same theory work in a situation such as a capacitor?\n\nTIA",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a maker trying to create an interactive dance floor composed of square tiles (roughly 25x25cm). Each tile has a translucent surface on top, which is above a thin square frame which houses the light element inside. Each tile should be sensitive to pressure (when somebody steps on it) and should be sensitive in all it's surface, inclusing it's corners. This sensing mechanism should be very robust and as cheap as possible since it's going to be replicated many times.\n\nI have done extensive research and designed many prototypes but I haven't found a satisfying solution. I would love to hear fresh ideas on this topic because I am a bit stuck at the moment.\n\nThe sensing elements can be placed in the thin square frame or alternatively the frame can be placed above a solid square which then would be above the sensing element (which in this case could have any shape that fits in the square), but the sensor element in the frame is preferable as it makes everything more compact.\n\nI have tried the following sensing strategies:\n\n1. Capacitive sensors: too unreliable and the readout is more complicated than desirable.\n2. Piezoelectric materials such as velostat: also unreliable in my experience, as the resistance drifts over time. Also it's hard to get even pressure accross (I made a sensor in the same of a square frame).\n3. Mechanical contact switch using compliant 3D design: this is my current candidate solution at this time but I have not managed to be reliable enough. I have designed a frame which is printed in PLA and using copper tape the circuit is closed once vertical pressure is applied. However it is also unreliable as the copper tape connections are difficult to get right (some get loose over time). Also I am not convinced on the long term performance on the PLA under this kind of stress. Apparently I cannot share images but I could share some of my designs.\n\nThese are the strategies I have tried, I have also though about using micro switches or similar in combination with a 3d printed compliant frame but I am afraid the travel distance of the switch would be too much (ideally the tile should not move more than 1-2 mm once stepped on).\n\nI have also seen some device called ribbon switches which I guess could work but the price is out of our range, perhaps it could be possible to 3d print a similar sensor.\n\nAnyways I would love to see if anybody has any fresh ideas, thanks!",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI moved into a house a little over 6 months ago that has a stair case from the garage into the basement. A month or two after moving in I noticed some cracks in the retaining wall that runs adjacent to that stair case. There is a horizontal crack running the length of the wall just below the level of the garage floor. The horizontal crack is just over 1/16” wide at the widest section. There are also some hairline vertical cracks which run from the horizontal crack all the way down to the slab at the base of the stairs. As you’ll see in the pictures below, the horizontal crack seems to continue out onto the slab of the garage floor. The horizontal crack does not appear to continue into the basement.\n\nHere’s pictures of the cracks, along with a picture of the house drawing to help you gain perspective: https://imgur.com/a/U7sOjHb\n\nThe cracks have really been stressing me out since I found them, so I have been monitoring them for movement. As far as I can tell with a tape measure, the cracks have not moved since I have owned the house. The house was built around 2000, so the cracks could potentially be over 20 years old, but I have no idea when they formed.\n\nI contacted a licensed PE, and his opinion was that the cracks should be monitored for movement but don’t necessarily require immediate attention. I have struggled to find any other PEs in my area who do this type of work (I have found plenty of foundation repair companies, but none of them are licensed PEs) to get a second opinion.\n\nIs there anybody out there more experienced than me who has any insight on the severity of these cracks? My current plan is to address the cracks to prevent any further movement. My simplest idea is removing the top course to gain access to the cells of the cinder blocks, then dropping rebar in each cell and filling with grout. My most complex idea would be devising a plan to post-tension the CMU wall. However, I fear that any reinforcement method I pursue would only be effective at preventing the growth of the horizontal crack, as I have no way of orienting any rebar perpendicular to the vertical cracks. I also fear that strengthening this retaining wall may somehow result in the soil pressure damaging the adjacent house foundation walls.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The cleanliness, safety, and health hazards (especially with my current employer) are having me wanting to get out of this industry as soon as I can.\n\nI had a process engineering co-op with a mobile gas detector manufacturer (weird industry for a chemE to work, but it was the only place I could get last minute when I knew I had to fill a semester that I would've had to do part-time). I worked it that fall semester, and was asked to stay and work part-time while taking some classes in the following spring semester. Sadly, covid cut that short. The company had to cut all of their part-time employees, which included co-ops and interns.\n\nEver since then I have compared my other internship and my jobs I have work to my co-op. Even some job descriptions I have been critical of looking for similarities to my co-op. This being said, I really want to get back into some kind of electronics manufacturing. Plus it seems like there's a bunch of opportunities for this industry in Pittsburgh. \n\n(I want to bring up that I have experience in both process and quality engineering. I have done a lot of work in lean manufacturing and Six Sigma at my co-op and current position. I would like to find a role that involves these in the electronic industry.)\n\nWhat certifications do you suggest getting to help get back into the electronics industry? Is there any other suggestions that will help? I really don't want to go back to school.\n\nI really appreciate any feedback!",

Unfortunately there is no mechanical engineering department, so I cant ask them. I am good with the math (up to a certain point, somewhere around optics and quantum mechanics) but I really want to make stuff. I have seen many conflicting things about what a mechanical engineer does: some say it is an office job where you design products, which will be made by a machinist, some sources I have seen say that the mechanical engineer makes the prototypes, and some say that a ME can't do machining due to the difference in skills. The broad responses definitely have to do with the fact that it is a broad field. I really just don't want to be stuck in an office, I want to do stuff with my hands.\n\nI have seen some things on the internet that say it will take 1 or 2 years to get a bachelors in physics if you have a bachelors in ME, but nothing the other way around except something about getting a masters in ME by taking some remedial courses and then actually doing the masters program. \n\nWhat should I do? Is my idea of mechanical engineering flawed in some way?",

I’ve spent most of my time doing research about what my options are.\n\nFor starters, I have maintained a 4.0 GPA for three years and have gotten “Outstanding” and “Above Expectations” from my university and employers, so please don’t call me lazy when I say I have been DREADING an office job, or working 8/hr a day for 5 days a week in general.\n\nI love engineering, I really do, and I LOVE the challenge. I want a job that is flexible hours, I have ADHD and I really don’t understand why I must be in an office for 8 hours if I’m done my job in 4? The whole thing just seems silly to me. Point is, I’m looking for a challenging career that is project based and/or with flexible hours/hybrid/remote that actually makes a difference. \n\nI recently came across Design Engineering, and I am SO happy. It ticks all my boxes! It’s creative, fluid, challenging…oh my god! So for any Design Engineers out there: how do you feel about your job? What is it like? Any advice?\n\n\nAny other mechanical engineers/engineers with ADHD that love their jobs: what do you do?\n\n\nThank you guys, I’m really just looking for some advice without being labelled as lazy, because I’m trying really hard but this office 9-5 structure is eating at me when we are light on projects. I’m really panicking about graduation and would honestly appreciate any advice!",

The candy kit from the manufacturer comes with a small room temp cold trap. I know vacuum ovens and microwave vacuum ovens are used to make fruit chips and alike I just can't find much info on it. Obviously the vapor must be stopped before it reaches the pump. If I run a cryo cold trap of sufficient size with desiccant with the vac oven can I dry products with a high moisture content? Also if I run a home freezer constantly I can achieve -30c, is this cold enough for a cold trap for a freeze dryer or vac oven? I know many are -40 or colder but I would like to avoid dry ice, liquid nitrogen or muti compressor systems. I'm working on a Muti chamber dehydrator to dry things quick where I have a area that's already dry and added an enclosure with desiccant with the dehydrator within the enclosure. Anyone have any out of the box ideas here I'm open. Freeze dryers are costly and reasonably complicated to build. I am looking for ways to dry fruits and delicate liquids with as little change to the product as possible in an affordable way. Thanks so much!",

But when it comes to molecules and then assembled items, I need to be hand waving this.  What's a good rule of thumb I can use to hand wave things like this.\n\nIt doesn't need to be perfect... It's just there's time when ships overhead due to using too much energy, taking laser hits, flying too close to heat sources(like sun or explosions), thruster malfunctions...   When the ship's cargo gets too hot, I want the inventory to change state, possibly filling your ship with gas,or maybe just catching on fire if the combustion temp is low(which also provides more heat and could cause a chain reaction fire).\n\nIt's quite boring to database this stuff and since it is a game, it doesn't have to be too accurate.  I might manually type in numbers for elements, but for assembled components like electronics or space age materials, I'd rather one size fits all check box it.   \n\nAny suggestions for what 'One Size Fits All' data selections could be:\n\nLike Wood:\nflamabilitySolid = 620K;\ndensitySolid: 0.65 g cm^3\n\nIRON:\n        flamabilityGas = 0;\n        flamabilityLiquid = 0;\n        flamabilitySolid = 0;\n        densitySolid = 7.874 g cm^3;\n        densityLiquid = 6.900 g cm^3;\n        tempGasK = 1811 K;\n        tempLiquidK = 3134 K;\n\nThe game will have hundreds of thousands of items, so generic check boxes of similar properties will be good.  Do you have ideas of 'one size fits all' generic boxes of similar properties would be?  \"Electronics\", \"Metal parts\", \"Space Age parts\", \"foodstuffs\".... Or is there a good formula for alloys n stuff? Good charts to follow online?\n\nThanks,\nJim",

I would like to build my own [gadget wall](https://share.icloud.com/photos/052QRBJIqlDUp8bseqdVEuBEA) for my toddler.\n\nI’m thinking a wall mounted MDF or Plywood piece, with a bunch of little LED buttons, handles, switches, and other doodads, possibly powered by an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Although I’m not sure I want the thing to make a lot of noice other than mechanical.\n\nSo my question is, how do I go about this? Should I visit an auto mechanic to see if they have a trash heap of electronics? Should I go on eBay? Did someone else already make one and is selling a kit? Is there an Instructables, I’m not sure what exactly to search for here.\n\nI’d like to make it without breaking the bank, it doesn’t need to be too fancy, just some tactile buttons and of course one overly complicated launch rocker switch with at least two protective covers so he doesn’t [start WWIII accidentally](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk-kbjw0Y8U).",

So please let me know if any such device is already available in the market and how I can customize it to reduce the weight and remove the extra things. \n\nThanks in advance and really looking for all of your opinions.",
