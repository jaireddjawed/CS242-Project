        "text": "I (29M) have been with my girlfriend (25f) for about 2years. Most of our relationship has been in long distance -1.5 years to be more accurate, while she has been going to university. We live 5hr flight away.   \n\nI have always had problem with her friendship with guys but worked on solutions. This is because her friends in the closest friends group had a history of sleeping together. Besides, she also had slept with one her friends from the same friend group. She agreed to be seeing them in group settings and only when the guy friends in the group are the ones she never had a sexual past with or she and the guy friend never had a “thing” for each other. The completely platonic ones.     \n\nA year ago I found out she still had the the people she slept with regularly and recently before we got into a relationship on social media. And with one, she was also reacting to their pictures. We had a fight about this and she agreed to block anyone she had sexual past with from social media.     \n\nBeing in distance and having to work on trust, we decided to end the relationship 8 months ago but then got back together 3 months later when she came for a visit.     \n\nShe graduates 2 months from now but wants to stay away 4 months longer to figure out settling back in where we first met. So I gave her a visit recently while she had a break.    \n\nDuring my visit I decided to check her phone because I felt she was hiding stuff from me. I found out she had slept with also another guy from her friend group 4 years before we met. The one she likes the most out of her guy friends. He has also been my gf sister’s boyfriend for the past year.     \n\nI also found out 1 month after our breakup, she started talking with a guy she met on social media and regularly slept with recently before we met. One who she blocked while we were together.  I found out she kept some guys who flirted with her on social media while we were together. And some of the guy friends she had me believed never had thing for her, and she wanted to still hangout with, clearly wanted to have something more based on their messages.     \n\nI feel betrayed.    \n\nShould we be together?\n\nTDLR; my girlfriend and been together for about 2 years, most of which in distance. I recently discovered she lied about her friendship with her guy friends.",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I have always had this problem of not being able to connect emotionally. For some background we’ve been friends for 8 years, but got together around a year and a half ago. Romantic relationships are very different from friendships. I’m not sure if this is common, but growing up it seemed as if we had opposite traumas. His family dynamic was very explosive emotionally, his mother has BPD and he was the “favorite child” a lot of his life growing up. He had a lot of freedom and rarely got scolded for his actions, but many of the fights in his life have always escalated from 0-100 very quickly, and because of it he’s developed narcissistic tendencies (NPD traits). Growing up, I was very controlled and was raised Christian Baptist (trauma). I didn’t have freedom at all and I had to make up lies that I was studying at school or working in order to hang out with friends. Despite my accomplishments, I rarely got emotional support and remember crying as a child because my parents never said “I love you” leading me to develop borderline tendencies (BPD traits). \n\nOf course, I took responsibility for my outward expression and am currently on medication and attending therapy. However this morning i texted my boyfriend about a recent incident where he got so angry I came to his apt at 1am (hysterically) crying about how he cheated on me. I’m not proud of it, and he still says I’m trying to guilt him and that he should at least be able to get a night’s rest as he deserves the human right no matter what happens. It escalated and eventually got to an “uncontrollable point” where he held me down and spit on my face twice, and we’re currently still dealing with the legal repercussions. Despite all this, I know that people make mistakes and he has expressed his regret in doing so, but I told him moving forward I wouldn’t be able to stop crying so he could process his emotions due to being overwhelmed. He told me he was willing to compromise— that he would be okay with providing me emotional support given that I give him 5 minutes to just stop crying and give him time. He told me to ask my therapist about this to show me it was valid. \n\nI feel that when I’m distressed, which I would be over him engaging in sexual talk with strangers on Tinder, I need him to be there to comfort me. I explained that when I’m feeling down, I really do need my partner to be there for me right in that moment; That is an emotional need for me. However he explains his emotional needs require that I give him 5 minutes to process mine and his emotions, and then he’d be able to provide. If I don’t give him time, he says that he might reach a state of uncontrollable emotion that causes more damage than consolation due to being overwhelmed. I know that is valid and reasonable, but I also know that in those moments I will feel neglected emotionally. I want this relationship to work out and I love him so much, but it seems like we are emotionally incompatible at our core. Any genuine advice would be appreciated. \n\nTLDR: Boyfriend and I are emotionally incompatible, I love him very much and want it to work out. Looking for ways to move forward healthily that doesn’t undermine both our emotional needs.",

A few days after we broke up up she expressed her unhappiness we me that I stopped texting her, saying I went AWOL on her. \n\nOn my birthday two weeks ago. She called me to wish me happy birthday, then she suddenly said she has to go. I said bye and then she dropped the phone. A few minutes later she was texting me about how 'rude' I am for ending the conversation early while she was still speaking. \n\nToday she texted me to come to the mall to pick up the birthday present she got for me that she was supposed to give to me while we were dating. \nI'm recovering from this relationship so it was tough for me to make eye contact with her during our 5 minute encounter.

She then got upset that I had a problem with it saying I have I problem with all of her straight dude online friends( which I don't) and I have no reason to not trust her \n\napparently that guy isn't pansexual like he said he is gay and the bad relationship he was in was with a dude. Apparently she ment it in a joking manner and since I never voiced my opinion she never defended me and the reason he didn't say he was gay was because he didn't want me to get weirded out by flirting with me. And the falling asleep thing I guess she seen it as a friendly gesture and wanted to be there for him during his break up\n\nWe finally had an adult conversation about it and she offered to block him and the rest of her online friends because he was in all their chats and stuff and I told her fine but the second I get the vibe from him he and all of them are gone if that's what it takes. And we agreed to put it behind us. Thing is she still seems mad and she will complain about me bothering her when she is playing which apparently is something I need to work on but she was literally complaining about me bothering her and getting her killed when she asked me to get money from her and get a covid test at a specific time and I did just that but I guess I bothered her? \n\nAlso the drinking thing was at the beginning of the new year I've been sober since the first it was the third time in the relationship I've done this and she hasn't said I love you all year which is understandable building back trust takes time and the ball is in her court with it all I can do is the work which I've been doing.( And no I'm not turning back to it in a worse case scenario I did that for me not her.)\n\nNow how things are is I guess I have to sit quiet while I hear her giggle and laugh and literally had a sore throat with me for all night and morning and thought she need to go to the ER for strep or it was covid to laughing yelling and got her voice back almost completely and have a complete change of attitude.\nSo I guess the advice I'm looking for is should I press harder, voice my opinion or am I wrong and these people are just her homies and she is just mad at me and I need to keep doing the work?\n\nTL;DR my fiance almost fell asleep with a dude she just met online on the phone and we talked about it but I think she is still upset and I think that her online friends are now against me so idk if the issue is really resolved.",

My mum and my son (long story, child from a previous relationship) live in another county and this weekend after 4 months they came to visit me. \n\nMy dad lives in the same city as me however whenever I’ve tried to arrange an informal meeting she didn’t like the idea.\n\nThis weekend on the back of what happened with my dad, and also it’d be the first time she could have the chance to meet my child I’ve told her if she wanted to come to meet them, I’ve told her no pressure if you don’t feel like it it’s ok and she was like straight: NO, I don’t feel comfortable, although she was like say hi to your mum and son. \n\nI am not going to force it as not everyone reacts to these things the same way, for me it wasn’t an issue meeting her family it was actually a pleasure and I took it as she’s serious about me however not being able to do the same makes me wonder if she’s doing this because she will disappoint me at some point? Or something bad. \n\nIs it a red flag? \n\nTDLR; family came to visit I invited my gf for an informal meet up however she declined. Is it a bad sign?",

My mental health has not been the best and I have been feeling very anxious, stressed and I think I might have high functioning depression (I don't know if that's a real thing or not).\nI usually don't talk about how I feel because I am trying to deal with it myself or usually I talk about it In therapy but my ex managed to traumatize me so much that it actually pulled me out of therapy.\n\nNow I have also lost a lot of good friends for the past years due to living in different countries all around the world. So I have been quite lonely lately and my best friend was the only person who remained in my life but for some reason, she has been very passive and not responsive to my \" calls for help\".\nFor example I call her or text her crying, having a meltdown, I feel anxious, depressed, scared of evrything, having really horrible intrusive thoughts, etc. *if it's in texts, she sees my messages and reacts to them with 🫠😣😟🙄\nor she leaves me on delivered and manages to talk about something else. \n\n** if we are on the phone and I start talking about feeing lonely and not myself lately, etc.. she says nothing and Intrerupts me because *her bf just liked another girls picture on Instagram * or she changes the subject into something related to her, or someone else is calling and she hangs up.. or she gets very passive aggressive about it, getting annoyed with how I feel saying things like\n* again I have to hear you say you hate yourself*\n\nNow this does not happen every single time and of course she was there for me in some times when I needed her but for the past year or more, it has happened often enough to make me question our friendship.\n\n**now last week, she managed to ignore my very long messages where I was talking about my mental health and I somewhat confronted her about it saying that is very unpleasant when she does not engage in conversation when I am reaching out for help and she got annoyed, saying it's not true and she does not have the time to talk about these things and it is not her fault. \n\n**she said she will get back to me with some answers when she has time.\nit's been a week now and she hasn't said a word**\n\nIt really hurts me to see that she got so buthurt when I tried to express how she makes me feel.\n\nTL;DR : she is though very selfish and I don’t want to put with it anymore but I also don’t want to lose her because I love her regardless.",

We are both long distance and live about 4 hours from each other, she's in college and I'm working and we talk everyday and facetime. The first time that we hung out I invited her to come to my town and she drove all the way down to see me which was a big commitment since it was a long drive and so we hung out and had fun, we were going to different places, getting food, playing games and then later in the evening my other friend invited us to go to his place where there was my brother and their co worker friend all hanging out. So I drove us over to his place and we were watching TV and talking, my date and me were holding hands. My friend and date talked for a little bit, didn't think much of it, then he showed her his music he works on that I'm a part of since we're in a band together. Later after we left to go drop her off at the hotel she said she had a good time and my friends are cool when I asked what she thought of them. After we parted ways, I saw later on our band Instagram page that she had followed the band, and she also follows my friends personal IG page as well, I just thought it was weird because they didn't really even talk that much and she's already following him. I didn't bring it up and just kept dating her as usual. Then the next time we hung out, we did an escape room together with some of my other friends, my one friend is single and we were all in my car driving to the escape room talking and listening to music, and we did the escape room which was fun and after we got out of the room the staff member there asked to take a picture of all of us together which we did and we stood next to each other, my brother and his girlfriend stood next to each other, but then my girlfriend stood close to my friend on the opposite side of the picture instead of standing next to me in the picture who was standing all the way to the left, right next to my brother and I thought that was weird too and it bothered me because why wouldn't she stand next to her boyfriend in the picture if we're together and why would she instead choose to stand next to my friend in the photo? I don't know if she's trying to make me jealous or what but I don't like it and think its a bit weird they don't even know each other, I'm not sure if I can trust her but I want to and everything else seems to be going well.\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend followed my friends Instagram and likes his pictures and stood next to my friend in group photo instead of standing next to me.",

        "text": "\nI was 17 when I met my best friend. He and I are now both 27 years old (both cis men). Live in the US. \n\nSince we became friends, we were always super affectionate with each other. We’d see each other pretty much everyday or at least talk everyday, and would behave very differently than the ‘usual’ guy friendship. This has been going strong since we were 17. During those 9 years, we’ve both lived somewhat separate lives I.e. both had relationships, both had different careers etc. We are each others constant. We could be away from each other for months (as we were at college) and still see each other as our other halves. \n\nWe have always said we love and care deeply about one another. We’re not shy from being affectionate with each other. If we’re in the car sometimes we’ll stroke each others hands or interlock our fingers for a few moments. Sometimes If we watch a film or something one of us will lay our legs on the other persons lap or at the very least have our feet or legs touching. He’s never been afraid to show me affection despite him being a straight man and me a gay man. For us it’s a natural thing that isn’t forced.\n\nHowever… this is where it starts to get muddy. \n\nThere have been many, many events which have made me raise my eyebrow about how he feels about me since we were teenagers. \nTo save you from eye strain I’m going to list them so you get the idea…\n\nWe agreed to send each other a nude when we were like 20 (can’t recall context) I can honestly say I completely forgot about this until HE brought it up over some (heavy) drinks in front of some friends a few months ago.\n\nOver the years on more occasions than I can count he would jokingly ask me ‘what would you say if I told you I was in love with you?’ Or make statements like ‘imagine if we  fell in love.’ \n\nOn several occasions we’ve spooned and cuddled in bed pretty much in just our underwear.\n\nWhen he’s drunk he’s obsessed with telling me how much he loves me and will hold my hand or link my arm. However will tell me I’m his best friend. When we’re in the car sometimes we’ll stroke each others hands or interlock fingers.\n\nHe’s sometimes kissed me on the head/ forehead in public when we’re out for drinks with friends.\n\nWhen we’re drunk his eyes will steer towards my groin area. For example we go to the bathroom together and I catch him looking at me and he will sometimes make comments about my privates etc, and on more then one occasion we’ve both jokingly touched each other (consensually of course).\n\nHe’ll sometimes go into kiss me and then pull away last minute (after drinks)\n\nTells me and others that he and I are soul mates.\n\nOn a few occasions would change in front of me (naked) and I would catch his eyes looking at me almost as if he wanted me too see.\n\nSome other intimate stuff (not sex) that I can confidently say is not ‘normal’ for two friends. \n\nI even have had his parents tell me that they wish he would be with someone like me and trying to slyly find out if we are. I get his family friends interrogate me about our relationship asking if we’re more than friends. And lastly, a LOT of people ask me if he’s gay and assume that he might be. Of course I stand to his defence and let them know that he’s told me he’s straight. \n\nThis is a relationship which I cannot lose. We mean the absolute world to each other and we both say we cannot imagine a life without each other in it. \n\nHowever this is incredibly confusing and emotionally draining for me. I don’t want our relationship to change, but I’ve found that as our relationship becomes more intense, perhaps I’m low-key developing feelings for him. I feel as if I am in a romantic relationship just without the kissing and sex… I mean we send each other good morning love you texts every morning ffs. \n\nHe occasionally goes on dates with girls and it makes me feel really deflated and sad; almost like I feel I’m being cheated on when I’m not even in a relationship! Hahah. \n\nHe’s quite a masculine guy on the outside, but with me he acts completely different. Most of his friends are typical sports beer birds kinda guys. He’s completely comfortable in his own skin with me and acts a lot more feminine and vulnerable compared to when we’re with our friends. \n\nI feel like maybe there could be an elephant in the room, but he affirms that he is straight and gets quite defensive/upset with people when they ask or assume he’s gay. He will often comment about girls he finds attractive and will often go above and beyond to let our friends know that he is due to go on a date with a girl. I have previously told him that if he was ever conflicted about himself he could talk to me, and he knows this. I just feel as if Im stuck waiting in case the ‘what if’ situation becomes a reality. I’m not interested in seeing anyone else romantically because I’ve become so sucked into this. For me it just feels like it’s one sided because he’s going on dates (well within his right to do so as after all, we’re not in a relationship.)\n\nCan I politely request that all responses to this are respectful and kind. I know there may be some eye rolls but this situation really does have me by the throat and is affecting me emotionally. I feel like I don’t want to have an open conversation with him about this in the fear it will freak him out. The way we act around each other has become so normalised over the last decade that it’s not as if he’s done or said something out of the blue which would prompt me to bring it up. \n\nAm I going crazy, or do you think that he’s just not quite ready to have the honest conversation with himself about his sexuality?\n\nTL;DR: Straight best friend giving serious mixed signals or I’m misreading the situation entirely.",

He puts his things round my house and I wanna take it down. He leaves rubbish and things on my bedroom floor for days until I say something. He always making the same jokes and I'm bored of it.

        "text": "I come from different backgrounds with my bf. I’m Asian and he’s European. We’ve been together for more than a year. \n\nHe’s a hardworking individual, works two projects and many hours on weekdays. He works out everyday, and is recently on a salad diet for a few weeks. \n\nI work on the weekends and some weekdays. I also have a second ad hoc part time job which I do from time to time. In comparison to his work schedule, mine is more relaxed. I spend the weekdays with him when I have lesser workload/ off days. While I’m there, I workout in the gym for an hour every morning with him. In the evening, I study on Duolingo for 1-2hours. The rest of the time, I either do some work or scroll Facebook/IG/ watch videos on YouTube or Netflix to unwind.\n\nApparently, he thinks I spend too much time on my phone reading crap. Even though I gym and take on language learning , I’m still deemed to be wasting time. He said I should read more news and do more meaningful things. My news source comes from Facebook (news pages) but of course on Facebook I read entertainment news too. He thinks entertainment news are negative and gossipy, and I’ll end up being negative and depressed. I feel very blindsided; I did not think when I share interesting news (be it actual news or entertainment news) with him, he’d use it against me to criticize me. \n\nI retorted by saying he spends his leisure time watching movie critics on YouTube that talks very negatively. I did not judge his preference of videos and way to spend his leisure time so why was he doing it to me. He was flustered and tried to convince me that the movie critic was not all negative, though in the end he conceded that there were negative ones. \n\nI was very annoyed because he’s judging the way I spend my leisure time. I actually feel proud of myself going to the gym few times a week while I’m there at his place and also using my free time to learn another language but I’m only being highlighted for my flaws and it didn’t feel good. I told him to keep his opinions to himself and he knew I wasn’t happy and tried to soften the atmosphere. \n\nHowever we haven’t talked to each other all day and I think he’s also annoyed that I was annoyed yesterday. Am I justified to feel irritated? I feel like I can never live up to his expectations of me. \n\nAlso to add, just because I visit him on my off days, in comparison to his work schedule, I’m definitely more free than him. He seems to have this sense of himself working really hard and me lazing around. While he’s a motivated individual, I don’t interfere with how he spends his weekend off days. I just think he is very harsh on me and just judges me on everything. \n\nTLDR: bf judges me for using social media too much though he does too and is a very critical person.",

        "text": "I (F32) have been living overseas for almost 13 years, originally came here to study but then I met my husband (M39). That’s when I decided to stick around and apply for a permanent visa. We currently work and live in Australia. I am from Indonesia and he is from New Zealand.\n\nThe older I get, the more I realised I wanted to be closer to my family ie. Mum, dad, my sister and all my cousins I am fairly close with. I get to visit them at least once a year, and if time and money permits my immediate family will come visit me here.\n\nWe have a 1.5 year old daughter together and we have zero support system here. yes I have a few friends but they are not one I can always come to for when I am at a vulnerable stage. I feel comfortable being vulnerable with my family.\n\nI have been struggling mentally and nothing here makes me happy anymore for a few years now. There is nothing keeping me here, other than work and my husband/child. I have been wanting to come home for ages, but my husband doesn’t because he hates the city where I am from. He has been there before a few times on a holiday, I have to be honest I am not the best tour guide so I may have not left him anything nice that would make him want to come back… but it was not my intention.\n\nI wanted us to give it a try for at least a year and see how it goes. I feel like holidaying vs living are very different. He would be a foreigner in my country, but I will to the best of my ability help him get on his feet. This would include work, networking, anything he needs really. I work in an office full time whereas he does casual work, and because he doesn’t have any qualifications (education), I know it would be a challenge for him to get a job. But I know it’s not impossible.\n\nOur relationship has been put to one of the hardest tests I must say, as he mentioned that he’s happy to just stay in Australia while I go home with our daughter. He suggests I can come visit him here or vice versa, but that he will not live in my hometown knowing how much he hates it. He feels pressured and told me that I’m not giving him any options as our “happy medium”. He feels that I make it sound like packing your bag and go is an easy thing to do. I know it’s not, but every single discussion we have turns into an argument.\n\nI understand I’m not really giving him any other options and that I am being very selfish now, but the last thing I want is to separate from him because I love him so much and I feel that this is a cause worth fighting for.\n\nWe have considered Bali as our happy medium that might be come accommodating to him (lots of expats etc) but unfortunately even with that option, he is still very reluctant. The house in Australia will still be available for us to come back to if it does not work out. He does want our daughter to go to school here, which I am fine with. But it’s still years away so it is in my agenda but not the priority.\n\nWhat would you have done… if you have experienced the same struggle, how did you resolve it? Do you think this is the beginning of the end? I’m so torn and helpless. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I will fail. But I hate it here very much I just want to go…\n\nTLDR: I want to come home indefinitely to be closer to my family and want him to be part of it. But he doesn’t want to cause he hates the city and that he is convinced he will be miserable",

        "text": "My partner and I have been together for somewhat over 2 years. We have been living long distance, so we only see each other every 2 weeks (that is the routine usually, we meet on the weekend then). Sometimes less (once every 3-4 weekends)…He‘s trying to make art in his studio, he comes from a wealthy family so all he can do is focus on making art with all the tools and machines he could buy. The thing is though, that in somewhat over 2 years, he has not proceeded towards working on art. He always finds a new project to start, which has nothing to do with his actual goal. I‘m afraid that he‘s just avoiding working on making art because he‘s been alone since he graduated from art school and is anxious to get back into that world. \n\nSo the only time where we can see each other (since I am working in my family’s business and studying) is when I can take some days off, but he said we can’t meet up during the week or it will fck with his schedule. I agreed even though I am sad we only see each other every few weekends then. Now I have a month off of work, and he knew that I was planning to stay with him at least during a week, at HIS place. I said if it doesn’t work I will leave, I thought it would be nice to falls sleep in the evening and during the day we both try to work (he in his studio and me on some assignments for uni). He just doesn’t want me to come and said it won’t work, that it will just be too distracting and put him out of schedule. \n\nNow I can’t help but feel upset about it, in one year this is the only time where we can spend some time together, where I!!! have time to visit him so we both can be productive, since he complained about how he cannot be productive when he visits me. It frustrates me that he claims to know even though he can’t know and we haven’t tried being productive together. Besides that, if he was actually making art I would get it, but for 2 years he has been working on new projects all the time, that don’t directly contribute to his goal of making great art. I feel like he punishes our relationship for him not being where he wants to be. And I have to accept it. He becomes frustrated of his own behaviour too, but he would never admit that he‘s avoiding it. I know he takes his goal seriously, as in that is the most important thing in his life, and I respect that, but I have goals too which he doesn’t seem to be taking seriously. He basically tells me I‘m not determined enough if I have time to be so invested in a relationship. I went against a lot of my boundaries to respect his space and his goals and behaviour. I‘m afraid I‘m wasting my time for him to one day say „there is no space for you anymore“ or I get blamed for him being too distracted.\n\n\n\nTL;DR! My partner complains about not being able to be productive when visiting me, but doesn’t allow me to visit him so we both can be productive.",

        "text": "We didnt date that long, only about 2 months. But he was perfect to me and I really loved him. We were great for a few weeks til I let the L word slip one night, then had an anxiety attack the next day about how fast we were moving. I have kids and he lived an hour away, so we only saw each other once a week. It hit me that I might not be able to make it work given that dynamic, and we were going way faster than I thought we would be. But I fell for him so fast. I told him I dont think I was ready for a relationship that day, that I need to take care of my children first and know what it was like to be alone for a while. \n\nHe was really hurt, but the next day said we could take a step back, give each other space and meet again on our date night the next week to see if we could start over and go slower, or if I wanted to end things altogether. I wracked my brain all week about how we could realistically make it work, but came to the conclusion we should probably just say goodbye, I wasnt in the right mental state for an LTR. But when I saw him and he hugged me, I just melted and remembered how much I love him and told him we could start over. That was 2 weeks ago, and the last time I ever saw him. We texted back and forth like usual, flirting, and had our date planned for the following week.\n\nThen a few days later at work one night, he sent me a super flirty text that reminded me I cant really go slow with him, I was going to fall for him all over again and I still wasnt ready. Through sheer bad luck and dumb decision making on my end, an old fling texted me that same night asking me to get a drink.. and we slept together. Bf knew something was up when I didnt text him all night and ignored his call... and texted me in the morning asking \"how my date was\". I wasnt ready to hurt him and tell him what had happened, so I blew up at him. Looking back I dont know why and I cant believe how mean I was. I told him that I had repeatedly told him I wasnt ready, to stop texting me, and that I was glad I could finally just tell him it was over. We fought for a bit so I blocked his number.\n\nI felt bad so later that night I unblocked him. He was obviously hurt, lashed out and we fought again and both said really hurtful things. Until I broke down into tears and just told him what had happened. I could feel his heart breaking over text. We had a heart to heart for those next few hours, telling each other what we meant and how we still love each other and will miss each other, but that it was probably best if neither of us talked again after that night. I told him I realized that as soon as it was over with the other guy, I knew that we wouldve made it work... but it was too late. He was so caring and supportive through everything; and I threw it away. We said our final I love yous and goodbyes, and I blocked and deleted his number to start a healing process for both of us.\n\nWe didnt talk at all for 2 days, til I got a random text from one of his friends cussing me out, swearing at me and telling me how much I messed with him and hurt him. I said I hope he finds happiness with someone else and ignored the rest. I didnt think anything else of it, until a few nights after that the same friend texted me again saying he was gone; she called his phone after he hadnt answered for over 12 hours and his mom picked up and told her what happened. That he had shot himself through his own heart. The friend said he had been suffering from BPD and had issues already, but that me cheating was what finally sent him over the edge. That I threw away such a kind person for meaningless sex... and she was right. I hurt someone who loved me with all their heart that in the last minutes of their entire life their thoughts were of me hurting and betraying them.\n\nI have never cheated on anyone ever, and the fact that I could do it to someone that loved me as much as he did scares me about myself. The fact I might have hurt a soul so badly they felt the only escape from the pain was to take their own life is eating me alive. I know I made mistakes and no one deserves what I did but I dont know who else to talk to about this.  \n\n\nTl;dr: Broke the heart of the potential love of my life, and he took his own life because of it",

I may as well give up and save myself the time and trouble. I don’t feel like being compared or having to worry about it. I’m also upset that almost everyone else has got to have fun except me. I’m tired of being made fun of for being a virgin. This relationship was pretty much over the moment she told me that.

We’re not fighting over it but I am explaining myself to a wall. \n\nI asked my partner to be home before 4AM, and he fucked my request off. context below.\n\nI’ve been in a 3 year relationship, i’m moving and we’re splitting up because of it, and I want to enjoy my last week with my partner. We live together. (me, 22f, him, 27m.)\n\nHe wanted to go out tonight, so fine. I wanted to spend time with him, he doesnt want to — whatever. Picking my battles (but totally bummed)! Because of moving, we shut off my wifi, so I’m bored as hell, and have been since the beginning of the month anytime i’m home alone. My friends are all busy tonight, so I’m stuck alone with nothing to do. I’ve read all my books, played all my games, watched all the dvds. Just phonelocked and bedlocked. Not fun.\n\nHe does drugs when he parties — whatever, I do too. Just something to keep in mind rn. \n\nHe’s drinking, partying it up, comedy show with his guy friends, and that’s totally fine, but he tends to come home coked out of his mind at 6am on these nights, and thats not the vibe I want/need right before I move after a chill lonely day. So, I tried to find a middle ground, and asked for him to be home by 4 and not super drugged out. It drives me nuts when he’s super high, just comes home, fucks me and knocks out in a 15min span. He knows this, we’ve discussed it before.\n\n\ntl;dr: If your partner asked you to be home at a decent hour after a long night of partying, keep in mind I’m moving in a week, would you abide by that, and would it piss you off? Is it okay that I requested this?",

My last relationship before her was five years of toxic that ended almost two years before meeting her.\n\nI think I'm broken because I went from extremely caring and loving to talk to her to an empty feeling. It started when I didn't want to take calls anymore and making excuses, and now I notice myself pushing off planned time together. She's extremely sweet, kind, caring, completely nontoxic. She gives me space as I need it, she understands what's important to me, and respects my boundaries. I keep thinking well maybe my brain doesn't want to commit because how it's been hurt in the past, but I don't think it's fair to her for me to act like this.\n\nAs I said, she's caring, respects boundaries, very attractive, engaging. Perhaps it's the habit of being clingy that scares me? The messaging my friends when I can't talk, the I love yous, the I miss yous, the five minutes of snapchat when I get to watching them at the end of the day. I know most of these are positive cause they show she's thinking of me, but the more it happens the more withdrawn I get. Add that to general differences such as ultimately we like completely different environments. She'd rather have California weather, I like cold like Canada. I want to see snow, she doesn't. She wants kids, but I don't unless financially we are able to support the kid(s). \n\nAnd I would hate to break her heart. She is genuinely kind and caring. So very flirty and sweet. But I don't think I'm healed enough from the past nor do I think we're the right kind of fit for each other.\n\nWhat do I do? \n\nTLDR: I'm having doubts about my relationship but I don't know if I should end it or give it a try",

The stress from our job had been building up, our house was a mess and we were eating like shit. You could say we were down in the dumps. \nI wake up to find people sending me a post from Facebook of my boyfriend. Another girl was saying that she met up with this under a fake name. I asked him he just kept denying so I finally contacted her. Her friend met him in the exact location he was a couple of weeks ago (which is by the way very small place). I confront him about it and he admits to it. It takes me a lot of prodding but he finally says “yes I slept with her”. At this point I’m hysterical, and crying. I call in sick to work. While I’m on the phone with my boss, he tries to run out the door shouting he’s going to end it all. I stop him only to find a loaded gun in his pocket. I disarm it and force him to get in a vehicle and I drive him to the hospital. \n\nHe’s safe now and everyone is okay. But I found out last night it was more than once he cheated. He’s lied so much I can only believe that it’s more than the 4 he told me in the last 3 years. I’m conflicted on how I feel. Is it even possible for me to stay? Should I bolt after I know he is mentally ill and rebuild my life. I still love him and this hurts, but can I blame the whole situation on him being unstable and move on in a relationship with him? \n\nTLDR: my boyfriend tried to commit suicide after I found out he cheated multiple times  and trying to figure out if I should stay in this relationship.",

I have been worried my boyfriend has been cheating on me for a while after a few incidents regarding him hiding stuff and things not really adding up but i won’t go too much in depth. Anyway, i add him on a fake discord account and he messages saying hi. We have a conversation that progressively leads into sending selfies of each other ( i used a fake image ), and then him complimenting the catfish account. I flirted with him for a while and he seemed flirty back but seemed to drop hints that he knew what was going on, like i asked if he was single and he said i know who this is then when i acted confused said you seem like someone i know. He was also calling my phone and messaging me on my actual account randomly so i feel he was trying to see what i was doing. Anyways, on the fake account things progress to asking for his instagram handle. He states he doesn’t have instagram when he does. Then i asked for his snap which he gave out very willingly. We continued to message over discord and things turned into extremely flirty messages, and then when i asked if he traded nudes he said do you. He ended up sending nudes. After that, i looked at his profile as he has his first and last name linked to his Spotify that is be displayed on his account. I said his full name to which he replies “aha i knew it was you Amelia”. I said huh i was looking at your Spotify. He then quickly removed the Spotify from his account and deleted the nude he sent. Maybe i’m overthinking but does it at all seem like he was unsure it was me and wanted to double check before he continued with this fake acc? He never brought it up till i did by saying out of the blue “ it was me” with no other context and he said “i knew it was, i wanted you to admit it”. I love him and want to trust him with all i have in me, but i just can’t tell if some of these things are red flags. I am in his insta bio which makes me wonder why he said he didn’t have insta if he knew it was me. I also am not sure why he wouldn’t just shut down the convo instead of creating extra suspicions.\n\nTL;DR: I 18F catfished my 23M bf to see if he would cheat and i don’t know whether i should be suspicious of his response or not.",

He acts like he doesn’t really like me. We talk often, go out, have sex nearly as much as couples do. We got into an argument over something stupid weeks ago and as a result he gave me a 9 day silent treatment. On the 7th day my ex hit me up and I caught up with him. I originally stopped talking to my ex as respect for this guy. But since he ignored me for a long time I thought he ghosted me and wasn’t coming back so I started talking to my ex. Not to get back together just to have someone to talk to. After the 9th day he came back and we continued whatever it is we have. He’s learned that I’ve been talking to my ex and can’t stand it. Although we aren’t dating, Im nothing but truthful to him. He is assuming I’m sleeping with my ex regardless what I tell him and meeting up with him. My ex has been talking about meeting up but I’ve been declining him. I haven’t seen my ex in person since last year. I’m not interested either but me talking to him makes me feel like my options are open because this guy can’t make up his mind what he wants from me. He’s already made up his mind that he’s going to let me get back with my ex and leave me alone for good because of that’s what I want but it’s really not. I feel like I created unnecessary drama. What do I do?\n\n\ntl;dr: I reconnected with an ex while this guy I was seeing was giving me the silent treatment for 9 days. I thought he ghosted me so I started talking to my ex and now he is upset about it..",

        "text": "I am a male who plays an online social setting like game for about a year now. I have met a lot of people on it and have generally had a good time. About half a year ago I met this girl on said game who I became friends with. This was more than just friends because we would frequently call for hours whole playing another video game since we had gaming consoles. She lives across the world from me but timezones aren't a problem because I ruined my sleep schedule to be able to call her for hours in the night. Since we called a lot and we're generally flirty with eachother, we had grown a reputation of liking eachother amongst our friend group and people persuaded me to ask her to be my girlfriend. After some weeks of being dumb struck in love, I asked her to be my online girlfriend and after she thought it was a joke and gossiped about it, she said yes. Things seemed great since we already talked a lot and liked eachother it felt so what would be the issue? Won't we just like eachtoehr more and be even closer now? That's what I was thinking but recently it has gone down hill in my opinion. I noticed this blemish when I was roasted by a mutual that my girlfriend never says she loves me at all. This is true and I soon noticed she was never really loving towards me at all. It was mainly me being sweet towards her and her being kinda disgusted about it in a way. She never reciprocated lovng me and I am noticing this now. She is also not really nice in general, having her humor telling me to go die whenever I jokingly jab her for something. She also gets upset over things sometimes and will ignore me for a day and then come back to texting me the next acting like Nothing hapend or telling me I upset her. I realized that I am gaining nothing out of this other than pain and worry that I am messing it up in some way. I feel like she doesn't love me at all. I don't want to say this to her for fear that she might either brush it off, attack me, leave me, or slowly stop talkjg to me. Whenever we call recently which Is less than before, it is almost silent except for video game callouts. I dont know if I've just lost feelings or if she has instead.. She also has this other guy friend that says he loves her sometimes whether it's on her snapchat story or over instagram notes. I have told her that it's not ok for another guy to tell her he loves her when she is with me, but he answered for her since he was logged in on her snap and said there is nothing to worry about . She did not defend me at all and actually laughed over text and then simply brushed it off. She has even ditched me at some point to play with him online while we we're on our mediocre near silent call. Idk if I'm being jealous or paranoid in any way so pls tell me. I do not want to tell anyone this in fear of getting outed or ostracized by the friend group since there are a lot of snitches and I feel she would likely just leave me if I tell her this. Since she is not the affectionate type, I don't expect her to reassure me in any way, but rather tell other people about my insecurity. I feel if I leave her instead, I would be crucified by the friend group as well for upsetting her. I feel trapped and Idk what to do. What should I do? We Have been together for a couple months officially at this point.\n\nTldr: I fear my girlfriend and I have lost interest with eachother and I don't know what to do in fear of something bad happening.",

        "text": "\nMy husband and I have been together for 6 years and married for 4. We have a 3 year old daughter together. \n\nWe’ve never really had any issues and communicate ok. He’s lost a lot of people in his life so he struggles with anxiety and depression. \n\nHe works at a restaurant and can sometimes work late if it gets busy. \n\nTonight he was supposed to be off at 7pm and he took the weekend off as tomorrow/today is his birthday. I am writing this at 2am. \n\nHe let me know around 7 that it was busy and would be about another hour. I said ok and put our daughter down. Then around 10 o’clock he let me know that he was still there and it was really busy and that one of his team had to leave due to a family emergency so he had stayed to help. Said he was trying to leave soon. I said that was totally ok and I understand and I hope he is having an ok night.\n\nI started getting sleepy around 11 and sent a text saying that I was going to bed, but he text me when he was on his way home and that I loved him and was excited to spend tomorrow with him. \n\nI woke up midnight and saw that he had read my text message, but had not said anything. I was hoping that meant he was on his way home so I checked his location, we share locations, and I saw that he wasn’t on his way home, but was also not at work. He was pretty close to work, but not at work. Whenever I’ve looked at his location previously when he is working, it always shows inside his work, and will even move within the building. This showed him somewhere kind of far off in the parking lot. \n\nI text asking if he was still at work and got no response. I dozed off again and woke up again around one and saw that my messages had been read but still no response so I text him again asking him if everything was ok and I hope it wasn’t too crazy. He responded saying he was coming home. Over 30 minutes passed and there was no movement so I asked when he was on his way, honestly, at this point, I was a little bit worried that he might have been drinking with his coworkers and might need a ride home.\n\nRight around now, a full hour after he said he was on his way home. I text him saying I know you’re not on your way home you’re in the same saw that you’ve been for the past hour and a half two hours and that’s not the restaurant. He read that a few minutes ago called me saying he was on his way home now and he apologize for letting the night get away from him and I just said if you wanted to stay out drinking that’s fine I wish that he would’ve told me though, because I was worried that something had happened.\n\n\nHe then did admit that his coworkers had bought him bottles of alcohol, but didn’t really say if they had been drinking and I said that I know that he wasn’t at work and then he was reading my text messages and that I didn’t want to talk about it right now but I just wish that he had been open and honest with me. \n\nI told him I’d see him when he got home and here we are. \n\nI’ve never not trusted him before so this feels weird, but I also know when our relationship started, we used to sit in the parking lot and talk hours after work until feeling started developing and we started going out. So this extremely paranoid part of me thinks that is what was happening tonight.\n\nI really wouldn’t have cared if he had just told me. But he lied and he is claiming he didn’t read my messages and was at work the entire time.\n\nTLDR: my husband lied about being at work late on the night before his birthday. I feel like an idiot and don’t know that I believe what he told me.",

        "text": "Tldr: i have extreme jealous feelings when I catch my partner looking at other women \n\n\nHey all, \n\nReally needing some tips or advice here.\n\nI (25F) have extreme difficulty with jealousy. It's to the point where I can hardly leave the house with my partner (26M)  at times because of what it brings up for me.\n\nThe situation is something like this: \n\nWe leave the house, having an alright time... I see an attractive woman and immediately turn to see if my partner is looking at them. If they are, my stomach drops, my chest tightens and it feels like the walls are closing in around me. Extreme feelings of jealousy and insecurity. \n\nI then sit with these emotions and feel sick to my stomach - I know it's irrational and illogical to feel this way. I know it's only natural for men to look at attractive women, almost a reflex.\n\nI've tried to not follow my partners gaze and ignore it, but it hurts even more when I catch them looking without being on the lookout for it. \n\nIf I bring it up with my partner they get understandably annoyed and disappointed I feel like that and that i am accusing them.\n\nIt's just sitting with these feelings if insecurity put me in full shut down mode and I can hardly talk. \n\nI'll act out of insecurity and often if I sit with it too long I start crying. \n\nI have numerous mental health diagnosis and know this doesn't help, but I don't know how to communicate with my partner how insecure im feeling without it coming out as an accusation. \n\nI really want things to work with this person but my jealous tendencies just push them further and further away. \n\n\nIf anyone has felt like this before some tactics or tips on how to deal with it would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks for reading",
