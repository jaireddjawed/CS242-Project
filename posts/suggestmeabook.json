Thank you for that!\n\nOn the other hand, you might be surprised at how much spam we get from authors and bloggers, and by keeping our spam filters high it helps us to catch a lot of what gets posted.  You all do a great job of reporting the rest, and we appreciate you.\n\nDue to the spam filters and automod settings we have in place, some of your posts get temporarily filtered until we can review them.  Reddit recently created an automated message site-wide that creates a lot of confusion, saying your post has been removed.  PLEASE do not post again.  We aren't able to edit this message and we can't turn it off.  Your post hasn't been removed, it is just awaiting moderation.  If your post is removed by us, we will always give you a reason why and reference which rule has been violated.  If there isn't a reason, it was either removed by Reddit (you might be shadow banned and don't realize it) or it is in the moderation queue and will be actioned.  Either way, multiple posts won't help.\n\nThanks for understanding as we keep up with Reddit's changes.  We love this community and all of your passionate posts about books.  Keep reading and sharing, everyone!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1588389046.0},{"title":"An update from u\/goodreads-bot","author":"goodreads-bot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/suggestmeabook\/comments\/10bbcrf\/an_update_from_ugoodreadsbot\/","text":"Hi everyone.\n\nSorry for the late update. As you all have probably realized, I have not been posting comment replies linking to Goodreads anymore. This is definitely not my choice (I have been happily paying the small monthly cost to keep the bot running and would have continued to do so indefinitely), but rather a result of Goodreads finally revoking my API key.\n\nI don't think I have ever mentioned this, but I created this bot after having been laid off from my job in 2020. I needed something to keep my mind off of things while I searched for another one and I thought combining two things I enjoy (reading and Reddit) would make for a fun project. To be honest, I can't believe how much usage the bot got and how long that usage has lasted. Anyone who starts a project knows that one of the biggest hurdles is finding users to *actually use* and enjoy it. I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to create a project that had an (albeit, very tiny) impact on some people's lives. The fact that there were people that read (and hopefully enjoyed) books they might otherwise not have because of the bot is incredible to me.\n\nI really wish there was something I could do about this, but unless Goodreads decides to reenable their API the options are few.\n\nI appreciate everyone who used and loved the bot, and I am sorry to those who felt it was spammy (I understand those points and probably could have done more to make it better).\n\nFarewell, everyone.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673658692.0},{"title":"I\u2019d like to read a book set in a REALLY interesting world.

I started playing the video game Outriders recently and the story has me good enough that I'd like to find some books with a vaaaaaugely similar setting (off home planet colonization). \n\nIt could be much more mundane and without fancy sci Fi powers or mutants, or it could be similar there, either works. Could be more romance focused, social experiment stuff, could be just as much action as this game - I'm open to read the synopsis and\/or reviews for a lot of stories while I hunt for a good one. \n\n**Only major drawback** \n\nDespite my best efforts I *really* can't get into sci-fi books written in like the 60s where the sci-fi tech already feels ancient to me compared to modern sci-fi, lol.

Please take this in consideration. Dune, Wheel of Time, Malazan are good examples of this, as they're full of lazy, absurd or outright offensive use of sexuality as plot.
