I was looking at AG1. \n\nEverywhere I look online seems to say that you would be lacking fibre if you replaced veg with a greens powder, and also something about how you would need to drink more water. I’ve been tracking food on myfitnesspal and I’m getting 45g of fibre a day anyway so I would maybe say the lack of fibre from replacing the fruit and veg with a greens powder would not matter so much? \n\nAm I missing something here? As it seems to me like I should be ok to use a greens powder (which would be easier!). But I can’t find an answer through Google so thought I’d come here. Thanks in advance!",

I assume, then, that this is why the FDA recommends a weekly intake of 2 - 3 servings of sardines a week, or about 8 - 12 ounces. The good thing is that sardines have a very high concentration of EPA and DHA Omega-3--somewhere around 2 grams for 3 ounces. \n\nConsidering that the adequate intake value for EPA and DHA Omega-3 is apparently around 250 to 500 mg per day, would it be valid to get one's Omega-3 from 3 servings of 3 ounces of sardines a week, which would net 6000 mg of Omega-3 a week or an average of around 860 mg a day? This would stay within the limit of the suggested weekly intake for sardines, and also provide enough marine Omega-3 to stay above the EPA and DHA daily adequate intake value. However, I am unsure if a variety of things like getting all of your Omega-3 in 2 - 3 days rather than spread out across every day of the week are things worth considering or not.",

        "text": "Just started tracking calories again recently, and have been once again frustrated by wondering if I’m tracking compound recipes correctly.  Here’s an example from tonight, I made rice pilaf (or what my family calls rice pilaf lol):\n\nSo the ingredients that have calories are:\n\n8 tablespoons unsalted butter\n8 dry oz vermicelli pasta\n4 cups chicken broth\n1.5 cups whole grain brown rice \n\nSo in my tracking app, I create a recipe and enter all of those foods.  The app defaults to a generic single “serving,” so I can then see that all 4 of those ingredients combine to equal a little over 2,050 calories.  \n\nThen, once the dish is done cooking I measure the weight, in ounces, on my scale.  In this case, it produced 54 ounces of food.\n\nSo then I go back in the app and change the serving type to “ounces,” and designate that the recipe makes 54 single ounce servings.  It then calculates that the recipe is 36 calories an ounce.\n\nUp until this point, everything seems fine.  But then I start to spoon it out on my plate and follow along in my tracking app…and I land up with 8 oz only being 291 calories and I just have this sneaking suspicion that a half a pound’s worth of noodles, butter and rice (even whole grain) should not be less than 300 calories.\n\nShould this be mostly accurate?  It is the easiest way I’ve ever developed on my own to track compound recipes, but since I don’t cook off of recipes from websites often (where nutrition info is often provided), I have no gauge for its accuracy.",

I took about half the prerequisites for most masters programs and need to finish it out but no longer live in the US and trying to figure out how to complete the credits. At this point it's been 10 years so if iys an affordable fill program I can do that too. I'm trying to get into a specific Oncology nutrition program and the director is open to it as long as I have the right coursework completed so just looking for any accredited university coursework that I can afford, not the 40k US inflated tuition prices. Thank you in advance &lt;3",

        "text": "TLDR: Studies typically reference animal protein when arguing high amounts of protein as detrimental for your health. Does plant protein change the risk of disease and illness? Bonus points for pubmeds.\n\nIt is pretty well established that cancer rates shoot up in people once protein as a percentage of a diet passes 15%. In most of the studies I've read they are specifically talking about \"animal protein\", or just vaguely \"protein\". I haven't been able to find a study that says if plant protein has the same detrimental effects. I have a plant protein powder that is taken from peas, spinach, kale, blueberrys and other good earthy stuff so it can't be bad for you right? But I can't find any literature that has tested or discussed that. Like if i've already had a protein heavy day, but i'm lacking in veggies for the day, will taking the veggie protein be a net positive for me? I'm not quite sure how to think about the matter.",
