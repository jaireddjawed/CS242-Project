When the car in front of me finally drove off and i pulled up to the window and paid the guy says he'd be right back with my food. Ok. I look up and there's two what appeared to be managers asking me if my order was right....uh well I don't know yet because I'm still waiting on my food. They begin to yell at the kid that went to get my food! They come back a few seconds later and say oh sorry he gave your food to the car in front of you! Ugh.",

        "text": "So in the town across the bridge from mine, every year in August they have a sort of little festival, there's a bunch of food stands, local vendors, games, that sort of thing. \n\nSo I'm walking along and I have a craving for something unhealthy and deep-fried. I go up to a stand and have a brief internal debate about whether I want to clog my arteries with deep fried Oreos or funnel cake. I decide on the Oreos since they're a bit cheaper and I haven't had deep fried Oreos in a few years. \n\nGuy in front of me had the same idea, and after we each order they say a batch is just about to come out. We step off to the side to wait, and after a little while the guy before me gets his, so I'm next. Sometime during this time, a guy who was behind me (Who will henceforth be known as 'Jackass') orders some too. \n\nThe next order gets ready, and the girl who took my order walks in my direction with them. I'm about to receive my powdered-sugar drenched little dollops of deep-fried goodness...When suddenly, Jackass steps in, snatches the Oreos, and rushes off before either of us can say anything. \n\nThe poor girl, who's really sweet but slightly awkward, has braces, and can't be older than 16, has a mixed expression of confusion and surprise on her face. I would have been understanding if Jackass didn't know they were for me and got confused...But I was right there at the counter, and the girl was walking right in my direction. It was kinda obvious. Jackass was at the other side of the counter and dashed over to grab my treat. \n\nFortunately, it was a pretty big batch, and I receive mine next without incident. And they were fucking delicious. But some people are just rude and need to learn to wait their damn turn. &gt;:(\n\nPart of me hopes that someday, Jackass and I cross paths again, and I can have my revenge on the Oreo Bandit.",

        "text": "just need to vent. Sorry for the format, on mobile here. \n\nI am currently in vacation in Spain and I wanted to go to the local pool for a change. It's considered a little aquapark and mainly went there because I didn't want to get full of sand again, after I had visited the beach numerous times. \n\nNow, I wear a long bathing suit. It is not a burkini  but it consists of a short and a kind of tank top, all made out of bathing suit material(what is it? Neoprene?). However, I wear this instead of a traditional bathing suit because I have lost over 80 pound in a very short amount of time, and as a result I have tons of scars all over my body. I just wanted to cover those up as I am feeling very insecure about those. \n\nBack to the story : I paid my entrance and entered the pool. I was on there for a minute when I was told to leave the area. I was a little confused but I went to the lifeguard and asked what the problem was. He told me in Spanish that I am not allowed to enter the pool area in street clothes and that I need a specific bathing suite I tried to explain in Spanish that what I was wearing IS  a bathing suit it is just a little longer than the normal one  but I bought it in a swimwear department of a shopping center. He kept saying  \"como\" as if he wouldn't understand me (I have a very clear Spanish pronunciation  I teach Spanish kids German at the moment). He kept telling me that he didn't understand my\"accent\". When I tried to explain in English he said he didn't understand it, but I heard him a minute later speaking English to another tourist. When I confronted him he told me that he doesn't speak English in English. I tried asking another lifeguard and he told me very rudely that this was not considered a bathing suit in Spain. \n\nI really didn't want to leave but I figured that I can at least have my money back maybe, since nobody seemed to understand me. So I went to the cashier and asked for a refund. The life guard was right behind me and suddenly he understood every single word and told me in an incredible rude tone of voice that I already \"entered\" the swimming pool and that this justifies for them to keep my money for the \"entrance\". It wasn't that much but I still insisted because I already was pissed of that he lied to me. I asked for his name, he would give it to me. I asked for a corporate number he told me there was none. I told him surely there is, he told me there is no one and that I should leave the establishment. \n\nI was later told by the cashier that I can message them on Facebook and that they this life guard was the only black life guard and there fot easy to identify. I did this and I am still waiting for an answer. \n\nI am really pissed. If my bathing suit had been a problem then there surely was a more appropriate way to communicate this to me. The lies of that one life guard were ridiculous and The fact that they kept my money is outrageous. I know it was not much  but I have never felt more worthless in my life than at this moment. \n\nFuck you, black lifeguard that is easy to identify in Valencia. ",

        "text": "I walk up to the deli section of a grocery store.  It's a few minutes after 8am.  There's no other customers within 50 feet at least.  There's three people standing behind the counter chatting.\n\nI take a ticket from the \"take a ticket\" URNEXT line counter thingy.  It's 47, and the number on the LED board is 81.\n\nOne of the ladies rolls her eyes and comes over.\n\n**Her**:  Yeah?\n\n**Me**:  May I please have one pound each of low salt ham, sandwich pepperoni, and genoa salami, sliced thin please?\n\n**Her**:  *grunts*\n\nShe starts slicing and I hover near the deli case, trying to decide if I want turkey breast or not, trying to remember if my wife needs liverwurst (and hoping she doesn't), and thinking of my cheese order.\n\nShe comes back to the scale near me, piles 0.48-ish pounds of salami on top, takes it off, tares the scale again, puts it back on, stares at it, wiggles the pile of meat, takes it off, puts it back on, gives a loud huffing sigh, and slams her hands in a frustrated shrug to her hips.  Then she goes back over to the slicer, gives a few zip-zips of \"need more need fast\", stomps back over to the scale, drops the slices on top, tallies over 0.51, triggers the \"end sale\" print ticket and wraps it up.  As she starts to hand me the parcel, I ask\n\n**Me**:  May I please have another half pound of that?\n\n**Her**:  You asked for a pound, that's what you have\n\n**Me**:  No, *I show her the label she JUST printed* it's only a half pound.\n\n**Her**:  *shakes her hand at me as if to say \"give it back to me\"*\n\n**Me**:  *hands it back*\n\n**Her**:  *points to 6.99/pound*  See, that means you got a pound\n\n**Me**:  *looking around for the other people, who have mysteriously vanished*  No ma'am, that's the price.  The box to the right says 0.51, which is the weight, and the box to the right of that is the current price for the weight, which is less than 6.99, which means you didn't give me a pound.  I need a pound, please.\n\n**Her**:  *at this point she's glaring daggers at me, and if I was on the other side of the counter she'd probably be running ME across the slicer*  Well what do you need?\n\n**Me**:  I need a pound of that meat.\n\n**Her**:  *she shreds the package she just wrapped open, throws it back on the scale, goes back over to the slicer and starts slicing.  Every 4-10 slices, she stomps over to the scale, unceremoniously slaps the meat onto the pile and stares at me then says* Is that enough?\n\nEach slicing run she's making is barely adding five or six hundredths of a pound to the pile.\n\n**Me**:  No.  May I please have one pound?\n\nThis goes on until finally she gets to 0.98.  By this point there are now 3 other customers waiting behind me, and it's 8:20, and those other people behind the counter are still gone.\n\nI didn't expect this to progress anywhere near the way it had.  If I even imagined it would have done so, I'd have taken the half pound and just moved on with my shopping and come back or something.\n\n**Her**:  Are we at a pound yet?\n\n**Me**:  Good enough for what I need, thank you.\n\n**Her**:  *suddenly all smiles and talkative* So what are you using all that pepperoni and salami for?  Home-made stromboli?\n\n**Me**:  Ma'am, it took you almost twenty minutes to slice me one pound of meat.  I still don't have my pepperoni or low salt ham.  I'm not going to hold these other now five customers up, so I'm going to head out.  Have yourself a nice day.\n\nI didn't even get anything else of what I needed since there's another location an equal distance in the opposite direction from my house.\n\nOn my way out, I stopped at customer service.\n\n**Me**:  Hi, I'd like to make a complaint about your deli department employee.  *I describe the employee, since she had no name tag*.\n\n**CS Girl**:  Oh.  Her.  Yeah.  Thanks.\n\n**Me**:  I just spent over 20 minutes getting one pound of meat sliced.\n\n**CS Girl**: *actually looked shocked*\n\nAs she entered the \"office\" behind the counter, I heard\n\n**CS Girl**:  Another complaint about that (blank) in the deli.",

        "text": "TL;DR - informed my ISP about what I thought was a minor account issue, ended up losing free unlimited data that I didn't know I had.\n\n(If this is the wrong sub, feel free to remove. It already got removed from TIFU for not being fuck-uppy enough, but damnit, I'm going to complain to SOMEBODY)\n\n**The Players**\n\n$ISP - My internet company\n\n$Tech - technician for ISP\n\n$Me - take a guess!\n\nI moved last August, and had a technician from $ISP come hook up the modem at the new house. He was having a lot of trouble with it, it took him like two hours, and he ended up taking our original modem away with him, and leaving us a different one. I was mildly irritated, since I had that modem set up just right, but the internet worked so no big deal.\n\n\nFast forward to December: I got an email stating I was nearly at my monthly internet data cap. I logged into my account to see how much I had left. But when I looked at my usage, I saw nothing listed from October onward, data usage 0/300GB. I thought about calling, but I didn't want to lose 2 hours to call-tree hell, and I figured it was just an issue with the website itself. The data cap must be working, right? I got an email! So the website must not be reporting my data usage correctly, but it's probably working in the background and they'll email me when I approach the cap, right? RIGHT? (Hint: I was not right)\n\n\nFast forward to today: I'm a few seasons behind on GOT and Doctor Who, so I've been catching up this week. I've streamed a ton, surely I must be approaching the cap by now? I check my account, and the data usage for the past year is 0/300GB for every month except the first two. I decide their website is still broken. I am mildly irritated, so I decide to call $ISP to see if they can fix it. This was where I went wrong.\n\n\n$Me - Hi, my account is showing 0/300GB data usage for the past year or so. Can you fix it so it displays the amount?\n\n$Tech - That's not right, let me check your account\n\n\nHe logs into my account, and from his end, it is displaying 0GB/300GB used. It's not some minor bug on the website, it's actually not even tracking my data usage. Memories of all the shows I have streamed over the past year flash through my mind. I silently panic. I have messed up.\n\n\n$Tech - Thank you SO much for reporting this to us. Most people would see that and just go \"woo, free internet!\". But now that you have told us, we can correct it so you will be charged for the data you are using.\n\n$me - Oh...well I didn't realize it wasn't tracking my usage. :( I've gotten the warning email once before, so I figured it would tell me if I was approaching the cap?\n\n$Tech - yeah, I'm not actually sure what's going on, I'll need to talk to the Network guys, we may have to switch out your hardware. I will also talk to Accounts, and have them check your past bills to see if you owe any extra for data overage. I can see if I can use your honesty as a bargaining chip, to convince them to maybe not charge you for a year's worth of data overage, and just charge you going forward. What time can I call you back?\"\n\n\nWhat. Have. I. Done.\n\n\n$ISP wasn't even monitoring my internet usage. I had unlimited data with no extra cost and no repercussions. AND I JUST STRAIGHT UP TOLD THEM ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M STUPID. Since I've \"reported\" the \"issue\", they are going to \"fix\" it, and my days of carefree streaming are going to be gone. $ISP is currently trying to figure out what even happened in the first place, and I am really sad. I stream a LOT. Like, every night. I genuinely thought it would tell me if it was going to go over, but it didn't. So now I probably won't be able to watch all the shows I had been following, as I won't have enough data to stream them all.\n\n\nI am not very reassured by $Tech's promise to \"try and convince them not to charge me\" because sending a huge several-hundred-dollar-bill is exactly the kind of thing $ISP would do, and $Tech did not sound very optimistic at all. I can foresee an enormous wallet-destroying bill in my near future. (I'm still not paying for it, it was their fault, not mine. I can switch to $OtherISP if they try to be dickish.)\n\n\nI'm hoping to download as much as possible before they start monitoring the usage again. I should have kept my stupid mouth shut. Lesson learned. But hey, at least I'm honest, right? RIGHT?",

        "text": "This is my story on how my mistake, a lying car rental employee, and shitty weather almost ruined Christmas. \n\nIt was Christmas time and I was living with my husband in Montreal. We were to drive to my parents home near Toronto for the holidays. Knowing it would be a busy time for car rentals, I booked a car months in advanced. Coming up to the day we were to depart, a freak ice storm was predicted over Ontario to the east coast. Great, so we either had to drive in shitty conditions or we stayed home. We were pretty poor and my parents were paying me back for the rental, so some great holiday food trumped the danger. \n\nWe went to the rental agency in the early morning, and the snow had already started to fall. 30 cm in only a few hours. The busses stopped running so we took a cab, and slid our way over. At the agency there was about a dozen angry people who's reservations had been canceled. I think they were canceled on purpose so that they would be forced to rebook at a premium price. Speaking of waiting, we stood around for 2 hours trying to speak to an attendant. \n\nEventually I got too impatient and called the company hotline. They confirmed my reservation, told me the car was still in the garage, and when they learned about my wait time, they called the branch and forced them to talk to me. Fantastic! Not really. We argued about the reservation, them saying the car was not here etc, and me calling the hotline again to have them confirm the car was actually there and I wouldn't have to rent it for a premium rate. \n\nThen, they informed me I would have to take insurance on the car due to the weather. I was not going to be able to rent without getting their insurance. I have my own insurance for rental cars on my credit card but the attendant informed me it was void for his company. We argued a lot more on that point. The extra insurance payment would be $450 on top of all the other costs. \n\nI called my bank and got a confirmation that the card would be valid accident insurance. The attendant still refused to rent to me. I then called every other car rental agency in town, but no other cars were available. My husband was checking bus and train tickets but they too were sold out. There was only one way of getting to my parents and this was by paying the extra money. So fine, I did it. \n\nThe drive home too two days, averaging 25 km/hr. I drove as long as I could but eventually the ice forming on the windshield grew faster than the car could melt. We went through 2 of those big jugs of de-icing windshield washer fluid. We stopped in Kingston and stayed overnight in a motel that lost power just after we arrived. All the stores were closed, but the hotel made arrangements with a local pizza joint. They delivered 75% cooked pizzas to the hotel lobby, as their store went out of power just as they were finishing the order. It was a crazy storm. In the morning there was 3 cm of ice covering literally everything. \n\nIt was a ghostly ride to our destination. The only vehicles on the road were ambulances and snow plows. We counted 40 cars and trucks that had been in accidents and had been abandoned. Some towns didn't get power for weeks after. Needless to say we arrived safe and sound, due to my defensive and slow driving. \n\nTalking to my bank more about the insurance, they wanted me to do a charge back on the $450 extra fee. This was the big issue. The company rejected the idea I was coerced into paying it, but I knew the truth. The battle with then took 3 months. The head office for the rental agency got involved and sided with the store, saying it was always my choice. They went on to say they had proof! There were security cameras and audio recordings of our conversation. So I told my bank to ask for a copy of the audio recording because it would prove I had no choice but to agree to their new terms to get the car. \n\nThe bank took this information and got back to me a few days later with my money. The company emailed me and said they refuse out of principal to return that charge, but they removed $450 from the rest of the bill. So they still 'won'. What ever! I got my money back and my parents were happy to not have to pay the extra charge. \n\nTldr: I decided to risk my life driving in an ice storm. Car rental agency tried to force me to pay $450 extra for the privilege of driving in said storm. Bank asked for audio and security footage of my conversation in the rental agency. Got my money back. Had a good Christmas.",

        "text": "Today, I ordered from that online store that specializes in free 2-day delivery. These lovely people offer a 2-hour delivery service in my area on select items and had exactly what I needed to make dinner.\n\nI ordered a few things I still needed for my dinner plan, and included a treat of Drumstick ice cream cones. We almost never have sweets and my husband had a crappy start to his day. Everything was fine. I get a notification that my delivery is next and that I have to be there to accept it since it has food items. Okay, cool. \n\nI'm sat in the living room near the front door waiting. After about 20 minutes, I start checking the app to see if maybe they stopped somewhere else first. They were halfway across town! Then I hear a knock on the door. It's my neighbor, with whom I share a staircase with, asking if these paper bags at the top of the stairs were mine. I was SHOOK. They are mine. There's a wet spot on one of them.\n\nI hurry inside with them and open the wet bag. The ice packs have melted (it's not *hot*, but it ain't cool either). I check the ice cream. Soft, but not melted. Thank god. I call customer service to let them know one of their drivers isn't following protocol, and the *nicest* southern gentleman comes on the line. Of course, originating from the south myself, my accent comes out a bit when I hear his.\n\nI tell him what happened and he filled out a feedback form for me. He apologizes profusely and I told him, \"this is the first problem I've ever had with your company. Don't worry, I'll still be ordering from y'all.\" He laughs and I'm about to say thanks and goodbye when all of a sudden he goes, \"ma'am, for the inconvenience, I'm gonna go ahead and refund your frozen item. And you know what else I can do? I'm gonna stick a $5 credit on your account for next time.\"\n\nI'm flabbergasted. I just wanted them to know about a crappy driver. My ice cream was fine, but he insists. I then do my \"thank you so much\" spiel and hang up. I could cry.\n\nAnd there's your \"good service\" in the midst of all the bad today. Enjoy.",

        "author": "Soninuva",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/6tptq6/pizza_gone_wrong/",
        "text": "So today I ordered a pizza from my favorite pizza chain. It's primarily a buffet, but they also have to-go pizzas as well. When I was younger, I only ate at the buffet, but as I got older, since I like one pizza in particular overall, I simply get a large one to go. It's a somewhat unusual one. It's spinach alfredo (instead of being made with the standard cheese, they use alfredo, as the name implies, and omit the marinara or tomato sauce, then top it with boiled [or possibly steamed] spinach). I also customize mine by having them add garlic-butter to the crust. \n\nI'm a regular there, and almost all of the employees know exactly how I like mine, as I get the same kind every time, and I usually get it at least once a week. Some of them even recognize my voice, so as soon as I return their greeting on the phone, they ask if that's what I'm getting (which it always is). \n\nThat brings me to today. I called, and an unfamiliar voice answered. They were hiring recently, so I figure she's a new hire. I ordered it, and she asked me to repeat what kind it was, so I did, then asked for the garlic butter on the crust. She then repeated my order back and said it would be ready in about 10 minutes. \n\nI arrived within that time, and tell the girl I'm there to pick up the pizza for /u/Soninuva. \"With the garlic butter on the crust, right?\" I confirm this, and she gives me the total. I happened to have a coupon from a survey from my last visit, so handed it to her to get the discount. It was taking longer than usual, and she calls a manager. I gathered from what she was saying that she did something wrong and couldn't figure out how to undo it. He showed her how, and then completed the transaction. No big deal, mistakes happen, and I wasn't in a big rush, plus I understood that she was still learning the system. I waited to the side, and she brought my pizza out shortly after. \n\nShe opened it so I could check that it's fine. That's when I saw that instead of it being a spinach alfredo pizza, it was simply an alfredo cheese pizza (which while I don't mind, I didn't really want, as I really like the spinach pizza, and have been busy painting my sister's room and wanted to take a nice break). \n\nMe: Oh, I'm sorry, but I'd ordered the spinach alfredo pizza, not the cheese. \n\nNew Employee: No you didn't, you said Alfredo. \n\nMe: Um, I said spinach alfredo, I never order the plain cheese alfredo. \n\nN E: *muttering to herself as she takes it back and walks toward the kitchen area* You said alfredo...\n\nI didn't say anything because I was fairly tired already, but I was so pissed. That's my biggest pet peeve when it comes to food places. I know that sometimes customers order incorrectly and like to say they didn't so they can get what they wanted instead of what they ordered, but that's never the case with me. I'm a creature of habit when it comes to food. If there's a place that I frequent, I always order the exact same thing, the exact same way every time. \n\nI understand that mistakes happen, and it might even have been the one preparing the food that made it, rather than the one dealing with the customer. For the most part, it doesn't bother me, unless I'm on a really tight schedule. However, I hate it when they don't take responsibility for their error, and absolutely detest it when they have the gall to tell me that I told them something different. \n\nFor one, it implies that either I'm too stupid to realize that I ordered incorrectly, or alternatively that I'm a jerk and are trying not to own up to my mistake. \n\nSecondly, it shows that the employee is very unprofessional. Even if the customer did order incorrectly, if they stick with it, arguing won't solve anything. In my case, it also shows that they're petty enough to blame someone else for their mistake. \n\nNormally I would've launched into a spiel about how I always get the same thing, to the extent that practically everybody but this girl already knows my order, so it's nigh impossible that I would have suddenly ordered something else, but I didn't as she seemed the unreasonable type, and furthermore I was too tired to get into it. \n\nA similar incident happened back when I was substituting at a burger joint. I happened to have an assignment for a week at the same place, and so went to smear by place for lunch every day. I always ordered a burger with nothing but lettuce and ketchup. They put mayonnaise, which I absolutely detest, so I asked if they could redo it (I'd normally just remove the offending ingredient, but it had soaked into the buns). The lady then tried to tell me that they wouldn't because that's what I ordered. I had to get the manager and explain how I always order the same thing, don't even like mayonnaise, and for the past four days have ordered the exact same thing. \n\nTL;DR Pizza girl gets my order wrong, tries to tell me that's what I ordered even though I've ordered the same thing for years.

Now that I am working a full-time job I make sure to double check this policy.\n\n\nBack in the spring I made an appointment for August 14th for a check-up. I told them there was a chance I would have to reschedule due, and the receptionist told me as long as I called the day before I would not be charged any fees.\n\n\nCool.\n\n\nI forgot about my appointment. When I went on my lunch break I noticed that my dad had texted me saying they called them to confirm my appointment. A little bit annoying as I had given them my new address and cell number when I moved out last year. \n\n\nI called them and let them know I had totally forgotten about the appointment on Monday, but that I would reschedule later when I had gotten a chance to look at my work's calendar. No good, because unless I came in that Monday I was going to have to pay a fifty dollar cancellation fee. \n\n\nTheir 24 hour policy? It was a 48 policy I had not been aware of.\n\n\nThe receptionist said they sent out a reminder via mail, but I never received one nor did my parents (who I used to live with). They have my correct address though. \n \n\nI know it was bad of me to cancel at last minute, but I have been going there for years and it has also been a 24 hour cancellation policy. I had rescheduled the day before in the past and there was never a cancellation fee. If it has changed, fine, but let people know that. My parents go to the same dentist and they had no idea as well.\n\n\n",

This is probably a bit different than most and I hope it qualifies.\n10 years ago I was in college, was newly wed, and living off my wife's internship as an accountant, and student loans. I drove a three toned '93 ford probe GT that had half a key broken off in the ignition, the back passenger side window held on by duct tape, and it gave off a sad rumble that people pay good money for. What I'm saying is fast food was a luxury.\nI had just learned I aced an accounting exam and we were let out early by the prof. I figured, why not treat myself? I enter a pretty cheap fast food place and get in-line. There were all of 5 other customers in the restaurant, besides me, and 4 of them were in the line ahead of me.\nThese 4 gentleman were Mexican and had clearly been working hard all day. Their clothes were covered in dirt, cement, and paint. They had literally just finished their order when the credit card came back declined. Disheartened the man paying asks if they can run it again to which the elderly woman manager rolls her eyes and swipes it again.\nAgain it came back declined. The man shuffled in his wallet and pulled out a different credit card. Once again, declined. At this point the woman says something that caused me to react immediately. She will be referred to as Negative Nancy (NN) and I will be ME.\n\n&gt;NN: Well, why don't you just ask one of your friends back there to pay for it. (As she points to the line cook who was also Mexican, but clearly they didn't know each other)\n\nAt this point the 4 men start to pack up their things and look very disappointed.\n\n&gt;ME: Hold up. I'll pay for it. \n\n&gt;NN: What? I'm sure they have money or one of their friends in the back can pay. \n\n&gt;ME: No, that's fine. I've got it.\n\nHer entire demeanor changed. She ran my credit card and the men got their food, thanking me profusely. They then went to sit down. I proceeded to place my own order.\n\n&gt;NN: Why did you do that? (she sincerely wanted to know) \n\n&gt;ME: Everyone has hard days. I would hope someone would do that for me too. \n\n&gt;NN: I'm going to give you your meal for free. \n\n&gt;ME: You don't have too. \n\n&gt;NN: No. It's the least I can do.\n\n&gt;ME: Awesome. Thank you.\n\nI proceed to sit down when these 4 men come up to me. They wanted to thank me again. In the best English they could muster, they offered up their labor, asked if I needed any paving done, etc. I declined and I just asked them to pay it forward some day.\n\nOn a special note NN, who I think could be renamed Reformed Nancy, actually gave me my meal free the next time I came in, a week later.\n\nI've had a few opportunities in my life to do something like this and the way it makes me feel is indescribable. There is something special about providing a service with no expectation of reward. Little positive interactions can change people; even in retail.\n\nEdit: I suck at formatting.\nEdit 2: Clarification",

I am a rather large fellow, with an afro (at the time) a pretty huge beard and I'm wearing a Deadpool shirt. I'm aware that we don't exactly look like PhD candidates.\n\nWe enter the museum and pay our fee, grab a brochure and make nice with the lady in the lobby. We head to the top floor and visit each exhibit from on the way down. Enter, Mean Mug Security. Kinda rough looking older black guy-though I'm not \"black\" I'm unwhite enough to figure this guy wouldn't want to give me any trouble.\n\nWrong.\n\nThis guy followed us down each floor. He was doing the casual hands behind the back walk, eyeing us when we weren't looking. We weren't loud or anything crazy and we surely weren't touching anything. There was a video playing at one piece that I sat down and watched for about 20 good minutes, this guy stood still for 20 minutes eyeing me.\n\nSo we get done and I want to walk through the gift shop. We had checked a bag from the previous museum at the door which had some items we bought in it. We then walk through the gift shop and I went to the books and my fiance was looking at jewelry. Mean Mug entered the gift shop, exited and mysteriously appeared from a back entrance near the books. I fingered through the volumes and he did the hands-behind-the-back stare the whole time. \n\nFeeling a fight-of-flight reflex about the happen, I just left and motioned for my fiance to follow me. Even leaving, this SOB was eyeing us out on the street talking. His gaze stayed on me until we were out of sight. \n\nSorry, more of a rant, but wanted to get that out. ",

        "text": "This happened to me a while ago. I was calmly shopping for a new wallet and I enter a department store (one I'm pretty familiar with since my family worked in corporate and it's pretty big nationwide). I begin browsing their purses and wallet section and I see a wallet on clearance. The sticker looked lazily applied so I looked for another one just to make sure the wallet was on clearance and I found another one in the same model and the same lazily applied sticker. I take the wallet to one register and the cashier lady told me it wasn't on sale. Instead on insisting to the lady that it was on sale I commit the mistake of taking it to another counter **BIG MISTAKE**\n\nI take it to another counter and the lady on it is taking her time and by taking her time I mean calling fucking Loss Prevention. After 5 minutes a tall man calls my sister and I to a corner and went something like this:\n\n&gt;LP: Why are you stealin'?\nWe are shocked, because it was out of nowhere\n\n&gt;LP: YES, WHY ARE YOU STEALIN'?\n\n&gt;Me: (obviously agitated) no, sir\n\n&gt;LP: (getting a little worked) why are you lying? You now we have cameras right?\n\n&gt;Me: I know, but we aren't. This wallet was on sale\n\n&gt;LP: DONT LIE, LITTLE LADY you altered the (lazily applied) sticker on it! You know the consequences of stealin'\n\n&gt;Me: (at last getting was that about) I took it from the clearance rack\n\n&gt;LP: YOU DIDN'T! (he was trying to somehow make a scene so we would feel more intimidated and spill the beans and people were kind of gathering near)\n\n&gt;Cashier: YES YOU DID, WE HAVE CAMERAS!\n\n&gt;Me: I didn't and I'll prove it\n\nTook them to the clearance rack obviously being escorted by 2 big security guards, 2 cashiers and the floor manager. I take another wallet with the same sticker and same model\n\n&gt;Me: So I modified this too?\n\nThey take it to the register and lo and behold, the wallet IS in clearance. The look of the 5 people surrounding us changed to a terrified look and they ask me as if they weren't totally intimidating us\n\n&gt;Cashier: Do you still want it? \n\n&gt;Me: No\n\nNot even a sorry anything at all. After 5 grown adults yell and intimidate two girls for 15 minutes (I was 13 and my sis was 10). They just adjusted the stickers and the sales on their system and that was all. I still get mad thinking about it because we were little and had no idea how to react to something we didn't do. We just run scared to our mom and tell her everything and guess what, my mom was being watched. you know, when they are tailing someone suspicious through the whole store. 3 black suited guys were circling her and watching every move she made. She got really mad and talked to the store manager but since we aren't confrontational, she just kindly told him to be more careful. We could have totally fucked all those employees because my dad was a member of the board of directors on corporate, but thankfully (and sadly) we did nothing. \n\n**TL;DR** Little girls getting harassed at a store for something they didn't do",

        "text": "This happened about a week ago, when I was flying home from abroad. The airport I was in is large enough that it has shuttles to take you from one wing of gates to another, and I end up needing to take one.\n\nI'm sitting on the shuttle, staring into space, when a man in a suit boards and sits down next to me. As we start moving, he asks where I'm coming from, the usual small talk, and then how long I have until my flight. I tell him an hour, and he immediately loses interest in the conversation.\n\nAfter a moment, it becomes clear he was hoping I would ally with him in a mutiny against the drivers. He immediately goes up to the front of the shuttle and starts talking to the drivers. D for driver, I for impatient customer.\n\nI: Excuse me, how long will this shuttle take?\n\nD: Less than five minutes. \n\nI: Are you sure? I don't want to miss my flight.\n\nD: Sir, this drive has never taken longer than five minutes.\n\nI: I have a flight in twenty minutes, I can't miss that flight. \n\nD: We'll be there in three minutes. You'll have plenty of time to reach your gate. \n\nThe man falls silent. He seems to just be someone really worried about missing his flight. Then, a minute later, he speaks up again. \n\nI: Just let me off here, I'll walk to my gate. \n\nNote: We are driving alongside the runways. There are trucks full of luggage and outright planes everywhere. We're in America, they're not going to let some stranger unsupervised onto the runway, both for the stranger's safety and their own.\n\nD: I'm sorry. I can't do that. Look, our destination is right there. We're a minute away.\n\nI: Please, just let me off here. I can walk faster than this bus.\n\nD: I'm sorry, if I did that, I would lose my job.\n\nI: No one has to know, just let me off here. \n\nD: We have security cameras, and security patrolling around here. We're almost there, sir, just hold on for a minute.\n\nI: Please, I'm going to miss my flight. Just let me out.\n\nD: Sir, you'll arrive with plenty of time to find your gate. If I let you out here, I'll lose my job.\n\nI: My flight is more important than your job! \n\nD (laughing slightly): Sir, I need this job to feed my family, and to get them all health insurance. \n\nI: My flight is more important. Just let me out.\n\nThankfully, at that point, we pulled up alongside the gates, and the man bolted out of the bus as soon as the doors were open, because if someone was telling me that I should get fired so they can make it a few seconds earlier to their flight (which wasn't leaving for another twenty minutes), I am sure I would've had a hard time biting my tongue. I made a \"yikes\" face as the driver as I got off, and he laughed. \n\nAs far as I know, the man made it to his flight on time- the gate was literally an escalator ride and a one-minute walk from the shuttle drop-off point.

        "text": "The story:\nTonight we went out for my girlfriends birthday, she turned 21. Went out to a nice spot in the city obv a place that sells drinks/food/nice music. We walked in, greeted the host, she said hello back and then said to give her a minute she just had to \"do something really quick\". She walked upstairs to the dining area and got engaged in some long convo with her co worker. Normally I'd be okay with this like okay you got a job to do but it seemed like they were laughing and fooling around on their phones because they were scrolling though pics or texts or something. After about 10 min of standing around i grabbed a random waiter that i saw standing around and asked to seat us because the hostess left us there, to which he apologized and sat us. He walked us back around a corner to where they was plenty of seating available (something that took him 5 seconds so i don't know why the hostess couldn't do that first). Everything was okay i went to the bar to pickup some drinks since the waiter wasn't coming over i told the bartender to call a waitress over because we had been sitting for a little while without anyone attending. He was nice enough to help bring some of our drinks and got us menus, probably the only nice thing that happened while at this place. Basically we had to grab the waitress from a couple tables over because our table the one next to ours was not being served. Eventually, after about a good 20 min a waitress came over and said hello, introduced herself and took our orders. No apology nor explanation she just acted as if we were JUST seated. brief 1 min interaction between her telling us her name, saying welcome and then grabbing orders. NOW IS WHEN THINGS GET SLOPPY. We had ordered more drinks and some food. I saw her go to the bar and give the order of drinks to the bartender but he seemed to just look at the paper and put it down. Now we didn't mind the wait on food that much because we were a little tipsy from pre-game and the previous drinks and the music/ambiance was nice. Another twenty minutes pass, no waitress, no food, no drinks. ITS NOT EVEN BUSY I walk to the bartender to ask if we could get our drinks and if our orders were put in since again our table was not really being monitored and at this point the people next to us left (since their waitress never came after about half hour). He says oh yes let me check on that. He seems to radio someone and he says that the waitress will bring the drinks over. So i sit, i see a waiter(not our waitress) go to the bar and request drinks. Makes them, puts them on a tray and the waitress brings them over, says the food will be right out. GREAT AT LEAST WE HAVE DRINKS AFTER 20 MIN OR SO. Now maybe a minute goes by and  same waiter brings one of the orders out, we were 4 total. 10 min or so and he brings 2 orders out. One is wrong so he take it back. Still no fourth order. after about 15 min of waiting we decide to leave. We never got that order replaced and NO mention of the fourth order. I get up again to approach the bartender. I asked his name and ask what is happening, if we are we in a self serve area or something? He picks up our order check and says whats wrong? I explain that we have been pretty much neglected since we got here and that we are waiting on an order being fixed and we havent gotten our fourth order. He says we only ordered three things. I literally bring up by hands in the air with my face in awe. I politely ask for the manager(its rare that i ever do this maybe the second or third time in my adult life that ive asked for a manager). He responds \"Uhm lemme try and find em, not sure if there is one here.\" i ask if he is serious because that would explain a lot(being a little TOO passive aggressive hee hee). He responds \"yeah this place is a bit of a shit show\" I tell him it's ok, I thank him and walk away. I also spotted the waitress that \"attended\" us earlier and ask for her name, then ask for a manager. It was a nice interaction, he apologized for his absence on the floor. I explained my situation and and told him that we are leaving, that we would like the check so we can GTFO. He deducts the more expensive drinks and only charged us for the cheapest meal which was nice, i didnt ask him to do anything but to ask his employees what is going on? The night was still fun, my girlfriend and her friends think im funny and cool for the way i handled the situation. They were ready to burst and explode on the bartenders face as well as the managers. Now this isnt some tavern or some place in the alley it is in a popping area downtown so it isnt the cheapest place either. The interior is amazing but the service was just terrible. No one was synchronized with one another and some seemed like they weren't properly trained/managed. I made sure that he understood that i, personally, was more upset about this than the overall experienced.\n\nMy take on the situation:\nI myself am a manager at a tech retail store in my area. we have 4 managers and 60 employees total. It makes me upset when i get these sort of responses/comments about my our service. I try dam well to make sure everyone is doing what they are suppose to be doing. i dont micromanage at all, I know people have their way of doing their job but dam.. These people either didnt know or they were just not well informed on how their job works. Every person we spoke to didn't do their job correctly. I told the manager that everyone that worked here seemed like stray dogs locked up in this place. I explained to him that I didnt want to be rude to anyone because I know about that retail/management life. But i gave some real feedback to this dude. The bartender didn't seem to enjoy his life, your waitresses/hosts seem to not care much about the costumer and they certainly aren't working together to make sure people are properly serviced. I didnt curse at anyone nor yelled. He sort of understood that we had a terrible experience, not sure if he even was the manager he mostly just nodded and agreed with me. Not sure what kind of customer experience they are trying to provide at this place but i certainly didnt like it. I let it pass and turned the whole ordeal into a joke to try and get my drunk guests, and drunk girlfriend, to chill out and not ruin the night. But they weren't so nicely as they all made yelp accounts and left  terribly long complaints on yelp. Hopefully everyone still has their job!!",

That kind of thing.\n\nSo I pile into the check out line with a full cart, knowing it would run me 28$ and some change.

Promise.  \n\nThe young lady sighs and glances over her shoulder at an older woman standing nearby, who begins walking to the register.\n\nS: Yes?\n\nYL:He says his total is messed up.  The register is acting up and rang up 15.  What do I do? \n\nShe is becoming visibly upset at this point.  I felt bad for her but I value this store's service, and couldn't stand the thought of stealing from them.  The manager has her void the sail and re-ring everything, which comes to about 28.85. \n\nI happily pay them and go on my way, the whole time they stared at me as if I'd grown another head.\n\nTLDR; I'm honest, which deeply confused retail workers. \n",

So me and my dad one morning (this story was a pretty long time back) went to said coffee shop. He got a coffee, I got my donut holes. So i bite into one, and immediately i can tell somethings wrong. I looked inside and it was orange-ish, so i knew it was pumpkin. So we headed back (we went through the drive-thru, this is important.) and we said they got our order wrong and they apologized, all that. So they give us a new batch, and we drive off. I bite into one again, AND IT WAS PUMPKIN AGAIN. So one more time we came back, they apologized, we got a new order.

        "text": "ay it's my first post so go easy, heh (I'm also on mobile if that matters).\n\na few years back when I was still in my emo phase (relevant), my beloved mother took me to Mormon City, Utah to visit some family at Christmas and to do some shopping in a mall with stores us northern plebians aren't blessed with. My mom had her eyes set on one particular store, Car En Español, and once we found it she bestowed all her assorted bags on me and went to the bathroom. Being middle class we couldn't afford anything from this store but me and my black hoodie and black leggings lugged our many fancyvegansoapstore merchandise into the CEE to check it out and wait for my mom.\n\nto give you a vague idea of the layout, there's no racks or shelves or anything in the middle of the room, as everything is kept on shelving built into the walls. a very open floor plan where I am visible from every part of the currently empty store.\n\nI'm gonna start this by saying that even when I was cringey and in my early teens I made an effort to be nice and respectful to any adult (besides my mom who, like, totally didn't understand me rawr DX). So when me and my emotional and literal baggage slinked through the glass doors, I gave the two ladies working a nice smile and said hello. Neither of them said anything, so I just kinda ambled over to the shelves and took out an earbud so I could be aware of my surroundings. I can feel them staring at me, but considering I'm not going to steal anything and I also don't work here I opted to not do anything. if they wanna watch my cute face from the register, by all means. I don't own you.\n\nnot even ten seconds later I glance over to find one of the ladies is standing like 3 feet away from me. she's looking me dead in the eye. did she say something to me, perhaps? I didn't want to say \"did you say something?\" and risk reverting back to my angsty tone, so I took out my other earbud and tilted my head, giving her a very clear, \"huh?\" expression. at this point had she said something that I somehow didn't hear, one would usually repeat it considering I'm giving her my full attention. She just folded her arms and glared at me. alright, be that way. \n\nI keep browsing after a few more seconds and kind of amble down the wall toward the back of the store, thinking I was in her way. nope. she kept following me like some kind of designer Tom Nook, staying at a minimum 3 feet away from my edgy self. the second lady was still watching me from the register. this continued for a good 5 minutes until I finally got anxious enough to shuffle my way toward the door. the first lady literally followed me the whole way there and when I turned around she was still folding her arms and looking at me as if I had committed some horrible atrocity by daring to be in her presence.\n\nthe people at the fancy blue jewelry store opened the door for me and offered me hot cider from their fancy blue cups. I liked them a lot better.\n\nthis isn't really that intense of a story but it really rubbed me the wrong way. I don't really think it was necessary to follow me that closely (or glare at me) when I hadn't really done anything shifty. if you want me to leave my bag behind the register you can actually use your big kid words and ask me. I would've pretty womaned their asses had I actually had more than like ten dollars on me.",

I could see it from where I was and the call was on its 45th minute.  This poor guy had been stuck on the line so long that he actually had time to drive down and complain in person!  The employee just had an \"oh shit\" look on his face and started apologizing profusely.  The manager came out and offered him this pizza for free as well as his next pizza on the house.  Everyone involved handled the situation as well as they could considering the weird situation.  No one lost their temper or anything but it's still something that stands out because of how ludicrous the whole thing was. ",

I was at the airport with enough time to check in, check my bag, and head to my gate (I arrived later than I had originally wanted, due to not fault of my own). \nI already checked in the night before, but needed to check my bag. Take care of that, no problem. Get in line for the counter to drop off my bag. This is where it gets fun. \n\nA rather large woman starts pushing her way up through the line, with her rolling suitcase. \"Excuse me, excuse me....may I go in front of you? I have an 830 flight.....excuse me.....excuse me.....\" She manages to push her way all the way up from the back of the line, to the front of the line. Well, to me. She asks me if she can go ahead of me, as she has an 830am flight. As do I. \n\nI said, No I'm sorry, I also have an 830 flight. \nHer- Oh, are you going to X city? \nMe- Yes, I am (showing her my Magic Band for the Big Mouse). \nHer- Ugh, ok *sigh* \n\nThe couple in front of me turns around, and kindly allows us to go ahead of them, as their flight isnt until 10am or so. I do not allow the woman to get in front of me. \n\nI check my bag, head to security. I wanted coffee, but the line for the shop was about 30 deep, and it was already after 8am. Head to my gate, which was right next to the coffee shop. My ticket said SEAT ASSIGNED AT GATE. \n\nI see the woman at the gate counter, having a meltdown about something. Her two friends with her are trying to calm her down, \"Its ok, you made it here! Now we just have to get on the plane!\" \n\nI go to the other gate agent, and show my ticket. Low and behold, Seat Assigned at Gate meant FIRST CLASS (at least that day it did). I was allowed to go ahead and board, and was drinking coffee when the woman FINALLY got on board. She had to walk right past me to get to her seat. \n\n**Edit:** To clarify, the woman was using her body size and suitcase to push past the people in line, and acting like she was the Queen of England, trying to move her way through the line.

I tend to go to this particular grocery store for lunch 3-4 days a week, mostly for the salad. It's fresh, they rotate some of the different toppings, and I get to know the employees in the different sections. \nThe sushi man knows me, always says hello. The pizza man knows me, always asks how I'm doing. I see the same employees when I visit this store. \nI had been out of town on vacation, and just super busy with work, and had not been in about 2 weeks. \n\nI'm walking into the store, and as we sometimes do in the South, if we make eye contact with someone, we nod and smile, maybe say hello. \nAnyway. I'm walking into the store, wearing my dress and heels (I work in an office), and there's an elderly gentleman on the sidewalk. We nod, say hello, and I keep walking. He says, \"Oooh, you sure do have a nice (mumble mumble). I sure do like thos (mumble mumble mumble).\" \nI ignore him, and keep walking into the store. I get to the first kiosk (I guess that's what it is) right inside, and turn around and he's just standing outside the store, looking in and watching me. \n\nI head over to the salad bar and see the pizza man. We chat, and he mentions that I haven't been there in awhile.  \"Yeah, I was out of town,\" etc. Normal chitchat. \n\nI'm making my salad, and walk around the salad bar. I look up, and the old man has come back into the store (he had already left, he had bags) and is just standing in the front foyer area, looking. \nI have no idea what the pizza guy's name is, but I just walked right up to him and asked if he could help me out. \n\nPG- Sure, what's up? \nMe- You see this old man behind me? \nPG- ....Yeah. Yeah yeah, whats up? He creeping you out? \n\nI explained the previous encounter, and PG was on it. \"What do you want me to do? You want me to walk you out? He's over in produce, by the way...\" \nI finished making my lunch, and checked out. I walked past PG, and told him I was good, but thanked him. \n\nFast forward to that afternoon. I was coming back from an appointment, and stopped at the store, and spoke to the manager on duty. \nI explained everything that happened, and wanted to make sure he knew that PG was an awesome guy, who was looking out for his customers. \nI went back to PG, and told him thank you. He told me that I did the right thing. He had kept an eye on the creepy guy, and he said that it looked like he was flat out looking for me. \n\nNever felt so creeped out in my life. \n\n**TLDR:** The guy who makes the pizzas at my local grocery store is awesome.

        "text": "Hello everyone! My niece had a gymnastics recital the other day, and I offered to watch my nephew so her father could go without having to watch a toddler that can't sit still for more than 10 minutes. I took him to the park, and we ran around for about 3 hours, then on the way home I stopped by a store to grab a few things I needed.\n\nWhen I went in, my nephew was tired, but not in that pre meltdown cranky toddler phase we all dread. I brought his dinosaur book in for him to look at, and we went around the store, getting the groceries, just fine.\n\nWhile I was unloading my cart, my nephew was resting his head on his book, which was on the cart handlebar, and he looked really drowsy. The nice cashier smiled at me sympathetically and said 'it looks like someone's ready for a nap'.\n\nI was about to agree when this banshee of a woman behind me suddenly begins screaming at the poor cashier.\n\nBL: IS HE YOUR CHILD? I DIDN'T THINK SO! YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL HER HOW TO PARENT HER CHILD! IT'S DISRESPECTFUL! YOU ARE HERE TO SERVE US, NOT GIVE PARENTING ADVICE!\n\nSo, this crazy banshee lady is going off on the poor cashier who can't seem to get a word in, and my poor nephew thinks I'm being screamed at, and bursts into tears, howling in that way that only a freaked out toddler can.\n\nThe commotion drew a manager, and the moment he appeared, banshee lady rounded on him, screaming about the quality of people they employed there, and how mothers 'deserve to be able to shop without judgment' and how the cashier was invading my privacy and making horrid statements about me.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm trying to calm down my nephew but also defend the cashier, because she did nothing at all wrong. I've had people, including other parents, say variations of that same thing to me countless times, and it was never meant judgmentally. It was more like a 'I've been there too' statement, and I never found it offensive.\n\nI kept trying to get a word in, but banshee lady was yelling over me, the supposed victim, so that she could tell the manager how the poor cashier, who didn't look more than 20, was judgmental, nosy, disrespectful, discriminatory, and even racist! She was just insane.\n\nI think the manager understood my plight, because he led the lady away to another checkout line, where she would get immediate service and I guess some sort of compensation, and thankfully the couple behind her was really sweet and let me take my time getting my nephew calmed down and get my things together.\n\nI was tempted to get my nephew out and down for a nap and calling in to give my side of the story, but I was afraid the cashier would face punishment in the hour or so that would take. Thankfully, the manager didn't take long coming back and I was able to launch into the true story of what happened, emphasizing that at no time was I ever offended or upset, and that the banshee lady was absolutely nuclear batshit insane. \n\nThe manager waited for me to finish and then told me not to worry. The cashier was not in any trouble, and nobody took anything banshee lady said seriously anymore. She was in complaining every week to try and get compensation. \n\nThe manager even gave my nephew a booklet of dinosaur stickers, which he absolutely loved. And thankfully it wasn't too hard to get him down for a nap once I got home.\n\nBut banshee lady, wherever you are, you are a real piece of work. Using a tired toddler as a weapon in getting your compensation, and nearly traumatizing the cashier in the process. I hope you're happy with whatever money you got off, because you made my day a whole lot harder, wrecked the cashier's day, and terrified a toddler. I hope you bought eggs, and have to slam on the brakes on the way home, and they smash all over your trunk, and then the slime sits in this heat, and you have to live with the smell of the rotten egg you are.",

        "text": "So my husband just bought me a new wedding ring set. I've always had nicer fake ones, but always wanted a nice one with real diamonds because I'm a dumb girl. Anyway, he got me a nice little sterling silver set with some small diamonds in it from Walmart. It's not the fanciest but I still love it and do not at all care where it came from. However, it's a two piece set, and keeps sliding around and getting super annoying. So I decided to have the two rings soldered together. My husband took it to a local jewelry store to be told they couldn't do it because it's sterling silver, but there's a store in a local mall that can. There's like, at least 4 jewelry stores in this mall, so I decide to call them and ask. I called a few, and ended up deciding to go to a jewelry store chain that every kiss begins with. The guy in the phone says he's the manager, gives me his name and says to ask for him and is just really nice and professional in the phone.\n\nSo I decide to go to the mall and take my little brother with me, since he's in town this week and we can hang out and stuff after I drop the ring off. I'm 30, and my brother is 21. This is relevant later. We go, and the man I was told to ask for had stepped out for a bit. Whatever, no big deal. Brother and I shop around a bit. We return and he's there, and is super excited I came. He seems nice enough so far. I happen to spot a ring that's pretty and say something about it. He immediately goes on to salesman mode, but it was my own fault so I go with it. I told him I couldn't afford anything in that store, and he says oh they have financing available. I told him I don't have great credit and don't want to run my credit since that can be bad for it. He tells me it's not like that, it's more of a layaway program and not a credit card, so it won't hurt my credit. I still decline, I'm not interested. He says he will cut the price of getting my ring soldered in half if I let him check if I'm approved. So fine, whatever, let's see.\n\nHe gets all the info he needs and turns out I am approved for up to $1500 dollars. He gets excited because he KNOWS he's gonna make a sale. He starts talking to me about how the program works and blah blah blah. I told him I would really need to talk to my husband before making any decisions. He kinda agrees with this but still seems a little annoyed. He took out the ring I had commented on, which is $2500. He starts talking about it being more than what I was approved for but he can work around that, blah blah blah. I tell him again, I really need to discuss spending $2500 with my husband. I am really not interested in buying something without him here with me. He tells me I can buy it now and return it if my husband doesn't like it, but that it's ultimately my ring. I keep insisting, no, I really want my husband here. I really must discuss not only purchasing a ring, but doing any kind of financing. My husband is the main breadwinner and since he's better with money than I am, he's mostly in charge of the finances. He scoffs and rolls his eyes and says I shouldn't have to ask my husband permission to spend money. I tell him that's not it, but that's a lot of money to spend without consulting him first.\n\nFinally, he seems to give up and goes back to the ring I'm getting soldered. He starts looking at it and filling out forms to send it off. He asked me how much I paid for it, and I tell him $200. He made a very rude face like he was sarcastically saying well there's a shocker in his head. He starts telling me I deserve a ring that will last me forever, and my husband will understand that. Again, I say no.\n\nMeanwhile, my brother didn't come in with me, and is sitting in a chair in a little lobby area just outside the store playing with his phone. His hair is kinda long, and he's got it in like, a half pony tail bun thing that kinda have him a Samurai top knot. Also important later. I looked over at my brother, and the sales guy says that's not your husband, right? I tell him that's my little brother, and he rolls his eyes, then waves his hand and says oh he's fine, just leave him. He clearly didn't want me leaving the store to check on my brother. He continues writing up the sales ticket for my ring to be soldered, and trying to talk me in to financing a ring. He's telling me his schedule and when I can come back with my husband, because he just knows I need a \"better\" ring in my life, which kinda kissed me off. I looked over at my brother again to make sure he was still sitting there, and the salesman asks me the age difference between us. I tell him 8.5 years, and he says \"Oh so SOMEBODY was a surprise then!!\" As if to say my brother was a surprise accident baby. I mean. We both were. But still. He didn't know that and had no right to say it. I got pissed at this point and tell him look can we just go ahead and get this done? We have dinner plans. He then asks me if I'm going to dinner with my brother and his hair like that. I say yes, and he says oookkk and goes back to business. He then again tries to get me to buy a ring and tells me I can just go call my husband real quick. Finally, I had had enough, and tell him politely but firmly I will not be buying a ring from here today or anytime soon. I am very happy with the ring I have, and we just got it so I am not in the market for a new ring. I just want this one to be soldered, and that's it.\n\nThis is when he tells me he can't offer me that discount he mentioned earlier. Apparently, he had to see if I was approved and then I had to make a purchase in order to qualify for that discount. Fine. Whatever man. Just let me get out of here. This guy was just an arrogant, cocky douche the whole time. He definitely thought I was just some poor dumb girl with a cheap Wal-Mart ring so I could be easily manipulated in to financing an expensive ring and having biweekly, high interest payments taken from my bank account automatically. That I would be too stupid or impulsive to talk it over with my husband. When he realized I was not as easily manipulated as he thought, he acted like a total jerk and wouldn't give me the discount. I'm only letting them do my ring because they were the only place that offered a six month warranty on service, but they were less expensive than other places. I'm definitely gonna make sure he isn't there when I pick it up.\n\ntl;dr went to jewelry store to get a ring soldered, pushy salesman uses tacky tactics to try ana sell me a ring and calls my 8.5 years younger brother a surprise baby.",

On the day I chose to venture out, the office also asked if I could pick them up sustenance.\n\nWhen I pulled into the drive thru and up to the intercom, I speak my order of four roast beef and cheddar Smokehouse sandwiches.  That's when I am promptly corrected of my improper naming of the menu item.  Okay, sorry for calling \"Stacker\", \"Smokehouse\".  I conclude my order and arrive at the window to pay.  I'm met with a smiling attendant who hands me the big bag of food as I pay.\n\nOnce back at the office, my co-workers and I discover that what *should* be roast beef is one herb grilled chicken sandwich and three (including my own) turkey and Swiss.  The only part that wasn't messed up was the fries!  Our receipt reflected the correct order, but didn't translate to what was in front of us.  Our dilemma was 1) Drive back and return or 2) Just eat the mistakes.  We chose option 2.\n\nA few days ago, I returned to said beefy house.  A different attendant handed me my food and scowled when I opened the box in front of her to check if it was, in fact, the right sandwich.  Sure enough, it was, and this is a practice I won't soon abandon. \n\n**TL;DR**:  Don't be afraid to check your food at the drive thru, folks!",

IN MY OWN FUCKING COUNTRY!\"\n\nAt that point, the owner, who has been working the line quietly, pipes up.\n\nOwner: “Ma’am, I’m not Middle Eastern.”\n\nLady: “OH YEAH! WHERE YOU FROM?”\n\nOwner : “…Greece.”\n\nThere’s a moment of silence. Everyone’s eyes widen. Then the entire restaurant explodes into hysterical laughter. Half the patrons are clutching their stomachs, one is choking on his food as his wife pounds on his back while doubled over from laughter herself. A few are wiping away tears.\n\nMost people would leave as fast as humanly possible after this. Not this lady. After opening and closing her mouth silently for a few seconds, looking like a kid who just got caught pissing in Grandma's begonias, she tries to save the situation.\n\nLady: \"The fuck you mean? Greece is in the Middle East, you fucking racist dumbass.\"\n\nOwner: *struggling not to laugh*\" I'm FROM Greece, woman, you think I don't know know where it is?\"\n\nThe rest of the patrons are yelling stuff at her too at this point. \n\n\"Greece is in Europe, stupid!\"\n\"Get out before you make it worse!\"\n\"We're black too, girl! Shut up!\" \n\nShe gives it one more go.\n\nLady: \"Oh yeah?! I can prove it's in the Middle East! I can pull up my Maps. I'll get a map of the world. I'll show you. I'll fucking prove it.\"\n\nEveryone starts yelling at her to just get out and she's making the rest of us look bad. She finally leaves, only to pound on the restaurant's front window, screaming more obscenities before disappearing into the night.\n\nOwner: *sighing* \"Right...free crab cake to anyone who can find Greece in the Middle East.\"\n\nYou better believe they got good tips that night. No one got the free crab cake, though :(  \n\nTLDR: Greece is in Europe and no one gets free crab cakes.",

        "text": "I'm not entirely sure if this will count, but I'll share it anyway. Cross-post from /r/talesfromretail. \n\nA couple of days ago, I was at a shop that sells all sorts of random techy stuff, buying a drone. As I was waiting at the checkouts, a youngish (about 25 from how he looked) man barges in front of me, holding a hoverboard.\n\nHe goes straight to the front, cussing at anyone who didn't let him by. He slams the hoverboard onto the desk, and shouts at the cashier (I don't know how to do formatting properly)\n\nStupid user will be $SU, and cashier will be $C.\n\n$SU: This device is complete and utter crap! I want a refund.\n\n$C: What seems to be the problem sir?\n\n$SU: (yelling) This doesn't do what is F**king advertised to do!\n\nNow keep in mind that this is about 5pm on the day that most schools break up, so there are a load of kids in there.\n\n$C:Please calm down, and explain your problem.\n\n$SU: I will not fking calm down you piece of st! I'm actually very calm at this moment. My problem is, you pieces of s**t retailers lied to me!\n\n$C: Stop swearing, or I will have to send you out. Please explain how we lied to you.\n\n$SU: You said this was a hoverboard! I charged it up, and took it out to show my girlfriend that I'm also a Back To The Future fan, and wanted to show her that some things from the second film are real, namely the hoverboard. AND IT ONLY DROVE ACROSS THE GROUND! IT DIDN'T F**KING HOVER!\n\n$C: (smugly) Did you not see the wheels?\n\nAfter that I got the hell out. $SU seemed close to a full meltdown, being the pissed off customer he is. I put the drone back on the shelf though.\n\nEdit: I went back into the store, and $SU was there again, after getting kicked out in the first part. He was shouting all sorts of obscenities at the second cashier to serve him. Quick note: this was early in the morning, when there were barely any kids in there. Here's their conversation:\n\n$SU: You are going to give me a refund you c****!\n\n$C: Due to your previous behaviour, our management team has decided that you are no longer allowed to return items, even if you still have the receipt.\n\n$SU: This is completely unacceptable! Listen here: if it wasn't for me, you would be lying on the street homeless!\n\n(Note:he actually said that)\n\n$C: What about all of our other customers? They spend much more in here that you do, and they don't have this kind of sh***y attitude.\n\n(Note: after $SU had left, I asked $C, and they are allowed to swear if there are barely any customers inside)\n\n$SU: I don't have a sh***y attitude!\n\nAfter he yelled that, he started to be a real pain in the arse, and then started calling the cashier (who's black) the n-word continuously. He was forced to kick him out.\n\n$C: Due to your incredibly rude and racist attitude, you've been banned from this store, permanently.\n\n$SU: You are so getting fired.\n\nAfter all of this, I bought the drone, and $SU was never seen again.\n",

        "text": "Today I chose to ignore my inner dialogue once again and it bit me in the backside. I needed a few items and chose to go to the store I usually do not patronize because of previous experience. However, today I needed a particular item and so I bit the proverbial bullet and went. \n\nAs I was perusing the shelves a couple of kids bumped into me (literally) as they were playing tag in the aisles. I broke my finger on Friday and so it hurt. I looked at the kids and recognized one as the younger sibling of one of my students and called her out by name and told them to to stop running as they hurt me. They apologized and walked around the corner.  Shortly after in a separate aisle they came running around the corner and spotted me and the first child stopped sending the second careening into an endcap display knocking over several packages of toilet paper.  As they started walking away I called out telling them to please pick up the mess they had made.  \n\nI then returned to my shopping.  After finding all my items I approached the checkout where once again I saw the two girls running.  I looked at them and catching my eye they slowed down and I shook my head and began checking out.  At that moment I heard a crash and I turned to see that the girls had run into a candy display near the end of the rows of check stands.  That is when I was approached by a very upset store employee. \n\nShe began berating me about the kids and told me that I would need to pay for anything they ruined as I was unwilling to control my kids. I told her politely that I was not paying for anything they ruined as they were not my kids. She then demanded that I tell them to stop as I was responsible for them because she had already heard me telling them to stop by name. I once again explained they are not with me and I would assume no responsibility for them. That is when the kids made another lap by the checkout and she told me that if I didn't stop them that I would be banned from the store.  \n\nI was furious and yelled out the girl's name and she stopped.  I told her to come to me and when she did the employee had a self satisfied smirk on her face.  I then turned to the girl and asked her how I knew her.  She replied that I was her older brother's teacher and I asked where her parents were and she said that she was there with her cousin and aunt and they were running around the store looking for her aunt.  I told her to please find her aunt and stop running as they were making a big mess.  She then took off running yelling her aunt's name.  \n\nThe store employee didn't even apologize and I said \"I told you she wasn't with me\". To which the employee replied \"Well still you know her so you should feel responsible for making her behave!\"  I just paid for my items and left.  \n\nTL;dr. Apparently, I'm responsible for every child I recognize. ",

It must have gotten pretty busy that day and not many registers were open, so the lines were rather long in most places. The register adjacent to us had been blocked off with a shopping cart and a sign, and there were a mob of people waiting. The customers ahead of us had just finished and we were putting things on the belt to be rung up. From somewhere behind us we hear \"excuse me, sorry, pardon me, just need to get by\"; I figured it was just someone leaving after not finding what they were looking for because most of the other exits were blocked off. \n\nNext thing I know there's a man standing beside us.\n\"Excuse me,\" he says to my mother, \"do you mind if I go ahead of you? I only have this one item to pay for.\" He's holding a pack of gum.\n\nWe both look at him like he's got three heads. \n\n\"Well, you know there's a few other registers open and the self-checkouts are right there if you need to be out of here quickly,\" she replies.\n\n\"Yes but I am telling you that I just need to pay for this one thing!\"\n\n\"Right, but *I* am telling *you* that - \"\n\nHe then cuts her off by yelling at her in some other language before saying \"I DID NOT ASK YOU TO *TELL ME*!\" and storms away. The entire line and the cashier have fallen silent and are staring in the direction he's gone.  Where do you get off pushing past a barrier, cutting a line of 15-20 people in a busy store, and then asking the person at the front to cancel their transaction just to accommodate you? I was getting ready to rip this guy apart for being a complete moron as well, but I think he himself did a fine job of proving that to everyone. ",

        "text": "This is from quite a while ago, so exact details are a little fuzzy, but the basics are still fresh in my mind. I'm hoping my use of a product name doesn't break the anonymizing rules, as it's kind of important to one part of the story...  \n\nI'd bought a laptop, Acer or Asus (I always mix the two up) from the discount table at a big retailer. It was a demo model, but was in great shape, and I got it for a really low price. I was quite happy with it, but I decided a memory upgrade was in order, so I started out researching online. Whenever I can, I like to know exactly what I need before I go to a store. Found the memory at a local computer shop, so off I went.   \n\nWalked in and up to the service counter, and there's no-one around, or so I thought. I finally hear \"Can I HELP you??\" and notice a guy perched on a stool in the corner. He's like the live version of Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons... Very heavy, scruffy little beard, giant t-shirt and shorts, and he speaks exactly like the character, with the weird inflections and emphasis.  \n\n\"I'd like two 4GB sticks of Kensington ValueRam, model xxx12345 please.\"  \n\nHe rolls his eyes, still perched on his stool. \"What COMPUTER is it for?\"  \n\n\"An AcerAsus laptop.\"  \n\nAnother eyeroll, \"I'll need the EXACT make and model of the laptop so that I can order you the manufacturer APPROVED memory for it.\"  \n\n\"No, I've already got the model number of the RAM that I need. It's Kensington ValueRam xxx12345. Your website says you have it. Just need two sticks please.\"  \n\n\"You can't use that memory in just ANY laptop. And besides, it is LOW quality. There's a REASON they call it VALUE Ram. You need the manufacturer APPROVED memory. I'll need the EXACT make and model.\"  \n\n(Note, I'm an IT guy, and I've been building and repairing computers since the 80's, so I have a bit of a clue what I'm doing. I'd taken a look at the 'approved' memory when I was hunting online. two 4GB sticks would've cost more than I paid for the laptop. I've used ValueRam for years and had zero issues with it. Kensington is one of the top manufacturers of computer memory, and they're not going to stick their name on junk that doesn't work.)  \n\n\"So you don't have the memory that I asked for?\"  \n\n\"We do, but it won't work in your laptop.\"  \n\n\"Okay, thanks anyways.\" and I left.  \n\nOn the way home, I remembered a new computer shop had just opened not far away, so I figured what the hell and paid them a visit. Walked in, and asked \"Hi, do you have Kensington ValueRam model xxx12345?\"  \n\nThe friendly service desk guy says, \"Sure do. How much do you need?\" I'm assuming that he realized I knew what I needed because I was so specific with make and model, instead of just saying \"I need more memory.\"  \n\n5 minutes later, I'm getting into my car with my new memory, and, as a bonus, they were having a 10% off in-store special, so it was about $20 cheaper than the other place anyway. Laptop ran perfectly with the new memory for years until our dog knocked it off the table and it landed right on the power plug, breaking the corner of the motherboard that the port was soldered to. \n\nI pretty much do all of my computer parts shopping at the 'new' store now. They're not so new anymore, and have opened up other locations and in other cities. Their sales and service people are always friendly, helpful, and know their stuff. The original store that Comic Book Guy \"worked\" at? They're still around, but they've moved to a smaller store and the parking lot is always empty when I drive by.",

She asks me to come in with her and I say no you're just getting deodorant no need for us both to go in (one my life's greatest regrets). \n\nNext thing I know she comes out of the store with no deodorant. I ask where's your stuff? She replies we'll need to go somewhere else for it and she isn't allowed back to that store anymore? I'm immediately curious and very confused as my wife is truly one of the sweetest people I know. She let's me in on all the details that happened in the store...\n\nShe entered the store to a cashier screaming at a few young kids playing in the store. They had knocked a couple items off of the shelves and she was berating them to pick it up. Well, as my wife was grabbing a stick of deodorant from the shelf a couple fell on the floor as the shelf was over stuffed. Apparently the cashier snapped her head around and screams at my wife \"You better pick that shit up!\". My wife, taken aback by her talking to another adult this way, let alone a customer says \"excuse me?\" To which the cashier replied \"you heard me... pick it up NOW!\". \n\nAs I said my wife is an incredibly sweet woman and normally doesn't get angry or act petty, however something must've snapped in her because what she said happened next was very out of character for her. According to her, after the woman snapped at her twice to pick them up, and after my wife hearing her scream and cuss at a few kids for playing around she just calmly put her entire arm into the shelf stuffed full of deodorants and just ran her arm across the entire shelf spilling dozens of deodorant bars all over the floor. The cashier loses her fucking mind and starts screaming \"you're cleaning this shit up, I'm not fucking doing it, God Damnit!\" My wife just says \"make me\" and walks out of the store. \n\nIn hind sight it was a dick move on her part and she knows it, but had the cashier not been such a monumental asshole about it it would've gone very differently. \n\nAnyway that's my wife's most gangster moment story...",

        "text": "Background:\nI live in a small town of about 75,000 people and we love our Italian Cuisine, so of course my favorite restaurant in town is a locally owned Italian Diner. This restaurant in particular uses locally sourced vegetables, bread, meat, etc to prepare their meals. I have been going to this restaurant religiously for the past 10 years, in which I have gotten to know the owners &amp; staff that work there. Back in May, the owner decided that she wanted to sell the restaurant but keep the name &amp; menu the same since it has proven successful in the past. The owner ended up selling the restaurant to a local cafe owner down the street and made a deal with him that he can change the name of the restaurant &amp; menu after 3 years, but if she is not happy with how he is running it she can kick him out (this seems more of lease to me). He ended up taking over the restaurant at the end of May and it has been a disaster since. This restaurant was always packed when I went in (maybe 3 to 4 times a month) and had its regular customers, but recently it has lost its usual's and is dead every time I drive by it. I've been to the restaurant 3 times since it has been under new ownership and my experiences have been horrible, leading me to decide that I would never return to my favorite restaurant.\n\nThe Story:\nMy girlfriend and I decided to give the restaurant one more shot, as they make the best panzerotti's in town. The past two times we went in, they made simple mistakes to our orders that were fixed fairly quickly. We tried going to the restaurant with an open mind, but as soon as we walked in the waitress was standing behind the bar on her phone with a mouth full of food. The restaurant had one table occupied, and to be fair we could have seated ourselves but instead we stood there and waited for the waitress to notice us. Anyway, after a good 10 seconds she turns to us and says (with a mouthful of food) \"oh hey guys, you can go sit wherever\" as she continues to plow food down her gullet.\n\nWe go find a nice booth to sit and and the waitress followed us with our cutlery &amp; menus. We knew what we wanted as soon as we sat down, so we placed our order (one vegetarian panzerotti and one meat lovers panzerotti with spinach dip as an appetizer - carbs on carbs I know I LOVE IT). Everything was going good, the waitress brought us out our water and coffee and told us the appetizers would be out shortly. I know some people can exaggerate when they're waiting for food at a restaurant because they get HANGRY, but in this instance I timed this experience on my watch. 30 minutes later, the waitress is nowhere to be seen and we finished our waters and coffees. She didn't stop by to ask if we wanted refills, because I honestly think she forgot to punch in our order. Another 10 minutes passes by (40 minutes in total now) when she brings out our spinach dip and apologizes for the wait. I didn't want to be a dick but it was only us and another table in the restaurant, so why did it take 40 minutes to heat up dip and cut bread? Anyway another table walks in and sits behind us, so we have a total of 3 tables in the restaurant (there is another waitress waiting on tables as well).\n\nSo, we inhale our appetizer and are eagerly waiting for our panzerotti's to come out. Probably 10 minutes in between when she brought our appetizer out, I see my girlfriend face light up and this can only mean one thing, our panzerotti's were coming out! This look of joy on her face turned upside down as she saw the waitress bring the panzerotti's to another table. Okay, maybe they ordered panzerotti's too that's normal right? WRONG, the guy at the table cuts his panzo in half, looks at it, and says \"this isn't what I ordered\". So obviously the waitress brought our order to their table. The waitress apologizes and starts walking to our table with a panzo that another customer cut in half. I assume she was going to say \"sorry I brought these to the wrong table\" and try to pawn them off on us. My girlfriend gave her the death stare, which triggered the waitress to turn around and run off to the kitchen. I was confused because why would the waitress try bringing us this food, when a customer already went balls deep into it cutting the panzo in half with his own cutlery? I am just flabbergasted at this moment, we've been here for an hour and haven't got our main meal.\n\nThe waitress comes back to our table and apologizes for what happened, she offered us free desert while we wait for the kitchen to remake our food (since one panzo was cut in half and the other was going to get cold). We agreed with her proposal, thinking that the kitchen would put this order of remaking the panzo's on priority because of the screw up. While we were waiting, we saw people getting up to grab their own cheese/pepper/cutlery, because this waitress forgot to set the tables. My girlfriend and I were chatting about this waitress and how ditzy (incompetent) she was. She returned to other tables to double check their order \"you wanted a meatball with your lasagna right\" the customer replies \"Uh, no I ordered meat ravs\". It was complete and utter mess, she did not know what she was doing.\n\nSo another 20 minutes pass since she said that they would remake our panzos, and we were fed up with it so we decided to get up and pay for our coffees &amp; appetizer. When we go up to the counter our waitress was just standing there, and we said we were ready to pay and leave. She offered to deliver the panzos to our house, but we declined as we had made up our mind to go to another restaurant. So the waitress confirms that we don't want the panzos, peeks her head in the kitchen and yells \"DON'T MAKE THOSE PANZOS\". So you're telling me they haven't even got around to make them yet? What in the actual fuck is going on here, they should have made that priority after our waitress fucked our food up. So obviously now were pissed, and my girlfriend steps in. Very kindly she tells her how unacceptable this service was, and that we are not going to be paying for our coffee &amp; apps. The waitress apologizes and says that she's very sorry because she knows we are regulars and see's us come in all the time (lies she saw us come in twice since it has been under new ownership). You think there was a manager on duty to fix such an issue? Nope, but the waitress offers to give us her managers number to call him if we want. Now that's a big fucken NO NO. You never give out the managers number to customers, unless somebody lost a fucken limb at the restaurant. Anyway, she waves at us to leave and says \"don't worry about it, the meal is on me\". Sure whatever, that was just a peachy departure miss\". We ended up going to another Italian restaurant and got panzo's there, tipping the waiter 50% because he blew us out of the water with his service, compared to the dummy we just dealt with.\n\nThe Aftermath:\nIt was apparent that if the manager wasn't present on a Saturday night, that he would have no interest in hearing our story of the incompetent waitress and overall poor management at his newly owned restaurant. Instead, I took it upon myself to contact the original owner myself and tell her the horrendous story of what we experienced. The original owner said this wasn't the first time she heard that somebody had a bad experience at the restaurant. She told me that she would defiantly mention it to the new owner and if he didn't turn things around that she would kick him off the lease. I was quite pleased with this, because this new owner was totally ruining the reputation this restaurant had (since the sign is still up).

        "text": "I often swing around /r/TalesFromTheCustomer and /r/TalesFromRetail once every couple of months or so, mostly for a laugh or two and to remind myself why it's so important to *always* be polite, calm and reasonable. I honestly never thought I'd have cause to post anything here myself--I don't shop, or really interact with random people much at all) but something seriously weird happened to me today.\n\nI'd been feeling kind of bad all day (chronic health problems) but I needed to grab some groceries. I wasn't able to leave home until around 7:30pm, and had to take half a Vicodin and a few other things just to get moving (yes, it's relevant).\n\nSo, anyway, it was kind of unpleasant and took a bit longer than normal to grab all my groceries--by then it was 8pm and I just didn't feel like making anything, so I figured I'd swing by a certain Midwestern (USA) fast food restaurant mostly known for roast beef and diarrhea--to grab dinner.\n\nA certain restaurant that, for whatever unholy reason, seems to be the only place on Earth beyond my middle school cafeteria (pre-Michelle Obama) where one can actually purchase curly fries.\n\n*Mmm... curly fries....*\n\nSpoiler: I did not get my curly fries.\n\nAnyway, I pull up to the intercom, and nothing. I wait for a bit, and then tap the side of my car a bit to make some noise, and the woman on the other end--let's call her Mary--offers to take my order.\n\n&gt; \"I'd like a small order of curly fries and a small Doctor Pepper,\" I say.\n\nSilence.\n\n*(I will be paraphrasing the dialog from here on out, both hers and mine, but I think my recollection is mostly accurate).*\n\nThen:\n\n&gt; \"That'll be $3.21, but please do not drive while you're high.\"\n\nAm I high?\n\nI... I don't think so. I mean, yeah, I'd taken some Vicodin, but half my normal dose, and I'd taken much more in the past and no one ever commented on my behavior or language. I am aware that the various drugs I'm prescribed do affect me... but not in any way that could be readily discernible after thirteen words across a scratchy intercom. I tend to ramble a bit. I'll forget words. In college, during our biweekly kanji and grammar quizzes (learning Japanese can be quite the nightmare) I noticed I'd score about 20% medicated than unmedicated.\n\nWas I high? I didn't think so.\n\nAnd if I *was* high, would she be able to tell? I didn't think so.\n\nWhile all of this is running through my mind, she keeps talking. While I sit there, dreaming of fried potatoes, this Mary woman proceeds to lecture me on the dangers of driving while high.\n\n&gt; \"It's really dangerous to drive while you're high. Please don't get into an accident. Or get pulled over by the cops. You could get hurt. You really shouldn't be doing this.\"\n\nYou get the idea. It went on for about 90 seconds, which may not sound like a long time... but when some random woman is giving you an unsolicited drug safety lecture via the intercom of a cheap fast food restaurant, each second is an hour.\n\nWhen she stops, I respond.\n\n&gt; \"Uh...\"\n\nIt still takes me a while to compose my thoughts.\n\n&gt; \"Do you think I'm high?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n&gt; \"...Why do you think I'm high?\"\n\nAt this point, gentle Reddit Randos, I feel like I should point out that, in my entire life, I have never been \"high.\" At least not in the recreational sense. Well, unless you count that one time back in university when I experimented with intentionally overdosing on sleeping pills for the usual reasons. I don't smoke--anything--or drink--anything. And my health is as such that even if I wanted to (I don't), and could afford it (I can't), it would probably be a bad idea.\n\n&gt; \"You just told me you were high.\"\n\nWHAT.THE.FUCK.MARY.\n\nI am *reaaaaaaally* confused now. Why does this woman think I'm high?\n\nI've got it! Maybe, before, when I first gave my order, I greeted her. Maybe there were actually fourteen words, not thirteen! What a twist!\n\n&gt; \"Hi, I'd like a small order of curly fries and a small Doctor Pepper,\" I might have said.\n\nI don't know how anyone could have possibly misinterpreted the word \"hi,\" as some sort of code for, \"dude, I am totally wasted right now,\" but my mind is reeling and it's the best justification I can think of.\n\n&gt; \"I did not say that. I am not high.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nBut I wait.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nAnd wait.\n\n...And wait some more.\n\nEventually, I say:\n\n&gt; \"...Are you going to apologize?\"\n\nWhich is a really fucking weird thing to have to say, right? People working service or retail jobs *always* apologize. Even when they've done nothing wrong; even when it's the *customer* who has done something wrong. They always, always apologize. They might not be able to *do* anything, they might not be *sincere*, but they never, never, never have to be prompted to apologize.\n\nBut good ol' Mary takes the hint.\n\n&gt; \"I. Am. Sorry. I. Said. You. Were. High.\"\n\nA little halting, but okay, yeah, whatever. It's done.\n\n&gt; \"Great.\"\n\nAfter saying that, *maybe* just a little under my breath (presumably it was audible over the intercom?) I start to drive away. As I leave, I hear Mary shout across the intercom,\n\n&gt; \"Ahahaha, I knew you were fucking high!\"\n\nFollowed by giggles that eventually dissolve into static as a pull further away.\n\nNow there's one car in front of me, and it's taking a long time. And while I wait, and I'm stewing and steeling myself for the inevitable confrontation. What do I do? Do I just drive right passed the window as soon as there's an opening? Do I try to confront Mary? Do I ask to speak to the manager? I pull up the Kindle app on my phone to calm down a bit while I read. I have decided to speak to the manager. No better way to forget about dealing with some insufferable ass than to read Mark Twain write about all the insufferable asses he meets, or often is. (A Collected Works book, if you're curious).\n\nAnyway, I'm pretty anxious. Something else you should know about me, aside from the *other* deeply personal things I've very subtly inserted into this anecdote, is that I've got some psychological problems. The idea of having to confront some random person... and then ask to speak to the manager, *another* random person... is kinda terrifying. If you've ever seen the TV show, \"Monk,\" with Tony Shalhoub... it's kind of like that, but worse. If you've ever been at a party but said, \"I'm really shy,\" or \"I'm kind of antisocial,\" or \"I'm an introvert,\" or \"I get anxious easily,\" or any shit like that... you know exactly what I go through the same way a puddle knows exactly what it feels like to be an ocean. Unless you've ever been completely mute for several months (at least)... you can't imagine how difficult just *speaking* can be.\n\nBut I pull through.\n\nNot because I'm offended, but because I'm stunned. I still can't quite believe what happened. The only conclusion I can reach is that Mary, dear old Mary, is as *high as a fucking kite.*\n\nAnd, I dunno, is this a rude thing to say? I don't want to eat or drink anything that may have been touched by this woman. \n\n...\n\nSo long story short (I am, in fact, renowned for my brevity) I finally pull up to the window where a large man is rather confused when I brush aside his greeting and immediately ask to speak to his manager. He could have been a teenager. I hope he didn't think I was going to complain about *him*. But, I mean... he probably did. I mean, who on Earth thinks taking on order on over an intercom could ever result in anything resulting in a customer complaint requiring the manager's presence or intercession? Not me, at least.\n\nSo I speak to the manager and relate the entire tale. I can't help but notice that the man who met me at the window and the \"manager\" are the only two people visible in the restaurant. Is the manager Mary? I don't know. I quickly--maybe too quickly--convey my experience. I'm very civil about it, refraining from (or, to be more honest, incapable of) the colorful prose and occasional bits of profanity littering this account. I use mundane adjectives like \"rude,\" and \"unprofessional,\" and leave saying, \"I do not think [Mary] is sober, and I do not want to accept any food from a place that permits behavior like hers.\"\n\nI think... I reacted appropriately. Probably. I half expected marijuana smoke to pour out of the window when it opened, but no dice. If that were the case, I could've just called the police and only had to utter two, maybe three sentences tops. Oh well, c'est la vie.\n\nThe manager nodded and agreed with everything I said, and mumbled something that may have been an apology as I left.\n\n....\n\nSo that's what happened. I'm sorry if this isn't quite as interesting a story as the usual fare 'round these parts, but I tried my best to make it amusing. I think I'll close out with a second, much shorter story, so everyone who made it this far--thanks for reading--congratulations! You now get *two* stories for the price of just *one!*\n\nAt the grocery store, there were several pieces of broken glass all over the self-checkout machine.\n\n--Who?\n\n--Why?\n\n--How?\n\nWe'll never know.",

        "text": "There's a local pub with fantastic food (the shepard's pie is the best I've ever had). They make nearly everything from scratch. It's packed in the evenings, but during the day it's dead. SO I thought it would make a good choice to drop in to for lunch. \n\nBut every time I did, it took forever to get my food. I'd be the only customer in there, or at most one or two others, and my food would take 30 or 40 minutes every time. The bartender would apologize profusely (usually a different one, the place seems to get a lot of turnover). I didn't want to be mean about it, it's a nice older couple that owns it. \n\nSo once a month or so I'd give it a try, and nearly every time I'd end up getting my food packed up to go because my lunch hour was just about over by the time it arrived. \n\nAfter 8 or 9 tries (I know, but the food was really good), I go in to order lunch.  And I say to the bartender - is this going to take a half an hour or more? If so, just let me know and I'll go somewhere else. Because it seems like it always does. \"Oh no!\" she says. And sure enough, the food is out in five minutes. \n\nAnother woman working there I guess overheard what I said. She said, \"Do you usually come in weekdays or weekends.\" \n\n\"Weekdays\" - but that day it happened to be a weekend. \n\"Oh, that's why. During the week, the cook gets here at 11:30, and he's laying everything out and prepping for the evening. So it's going to be a while before he can get around to making your order.\" \n\nMe: \"Yeah, but a half hour to 45 minutes?\" \n\nShe literally shrugged, turned and walked away. \n\nWhat?!? Nice way to waste a customer's time. How about, on weekdays, the kitchen just isn't open until whatever time they're ready later in the day. Wasting someone's time like that really is ridiculous. I'll never eat there again, regardless of the food being, as I said, really good. \n",

        "text": "Throw-away just in case...\n\nI spent a decent amount of time in the retail, service and tech support industries. I have my own war stories and like to think I'm a reasonable person. Normally if shit happened, it would be contained at work and I could compartmentalize, endure and deal with it. Yesterday marked the first occurrence of a shit-tastrophe within my domain and I'm struggling to figure out what to do about it.\n\nHere's what happened:\nTwo days ago our internet went out, effectively cutting us off from the outside world and throwing my household into a near apocalypse. We scheduled for someone from our ISP to come out to try to fix the problem. \n\nWe live in a condo complex and we have an access point with a rat's nest of cables used for dsl/phone of the surrounding condos. In the past, anytime someone tinkers with it our internet goes out.\n\nOur ISP Tech shows up in the allotted window. I go outside, meet him and brief him. He seems professional and comes inside. He asks if I mind if he quickly uses the restroom. I of course immediately agree and show him where the half bath at the front of the house is and go back to whatever I had been doing.\n\nHe finishes his business and gets back to solving the problem at hand. He does a few rounds of testing then goes to the common access point and immediately identifies the problem. It turns out a technician that came by yesterday pulled out our cables and attached our neighbor's instead of using an empty slot. Our tech used an empty slot then labeled the cables with \"in use - do not remove\".  ISP Tech saves the day and averts the near apocalypse and all is well in the world. I wish him well and he's on his way.\n\nNot that much later I'm summoned by loud noises of distress from my wife. I come prepared to do battle with insects, as that's the normal cause of this tone of distress. Unfortunately my weapons of choice aren't very effective for the situation I'm now confronted with.\n\nAs I open the door to the bathroom I see shit particles on the wall, floor and trash can. I also see what looks like a shit hand smear on the seat and small streams of shittiness on the outside of the toilet and in/on the trash. The icing on the shit-cake was a faint shit print on a white embroidered hand towel (a sentimental wedding gift). I'm not sure whether to be amazed or concerned that said shit-landscape had a color similar to iodine (dark yellow).\n\nI wash my hands thoroughly then consume a beverage of choice (okay maybe 2) and embark on the first pass to clean up. It was about as fun as you'd expect, and I'll have to do at least one more pass.\n\nHere's what I'm struggling with:\n\nHad the situation been reversed I have no idea how I would have handled it. I don't think there is a socially appropriate way to relay to a client: \"hey sorry dude but I had explosive diarrhea in your bathroom and may have destroyed some stuff\". I'd like to think I would have told the client but I'd sure as hell have been tempted to try to pretend nothing happened.\n\n* How do I report this to the ISP while remaining an adult? (I'm assuming while it sucks for ISP Tech I probably should)\n* How do I relay that this dude might not be well and that because I had to clean up his shit I'm now at least a little worried that I could get sick (you can get Hepatitis from something like this)\n* Is it reasonable to request a professional cleaning and replacement of towel and trash can or should I suck it up and treat this as one of life's bleachable moments where shit happens?",

We picked out two, a red one and a blue one, and continued on our way. We go to self-checkout, start ringing up items, and the blue shirt scans for $7 and the red $10. We checked the shirts and they are exactly the same other than the color but the blue one has a clearance tag. \n\nWe told he cashier minding the self checkout and she explained they had been having that problem and she didn't think she was able to change the prices but she would check. She flags down another lady who basically says the same thing but tells us we can just go find another one with the little clearance sticker on it and swap them out. \n\nNo problem, so my BF heads out. He's halfway there when she flags him down, tells him not to worry about it, and runs off. We presumed she was just going to get someone who could change the price for us. We of course were wrong. She simply asked another cashier, came back, repeated her explanation of them having the issue earlier and not being able to help. \n\nUs-\n&gt; Ok that's fine. it's no big deal, we will probably take it off and just get the cheaper one.\n\nHer- *takes red shirt*  *waves it in our faces* and says \n&gt; ***Sir, look at my face, does it look like I care???!***\n\nI had to scoop both mine and my BF's jaws off the floor.\n\nThe other cashier just cackled like it was the funniest thing ever.\n\nI may never go back. \n",

        "text": "SORRY FOR THE LONG WINDED POST, but I felt like every detail counts in this story.\n\nI have been a customer at this national furniture specializing in whole ROOM furniture sales for about 2 years.  I've purchased nearly 12k in furniture from them.\nMy latest purchase was a daybed with trundle and two mattresses purchased on Saturday July 8, 2017.  I was told by my Sales agent that delivery would be Wednesday July 12. \n\nI received a phone call from the store on Sunday July 9th to schedule delivery.  I informed them that we already scheduled the delivery for Wednesday July 12.  I was told that my sales agent never entered that date in the system and that Wednesday July 12 is no longer available.  I accepted a Friday July 14 delivery date.  Irritating, but no big deal.\n\nWe didn’t receive another phone call from anyone regarding delivery time, but we looked online and found the delivery time frame to be between 12 and 5.  I took a half day off work to stay home for the delivery.\n\nBy 4:50 on Friday July 15, we still hadn’t received a call or any information about our delivery.  So we called and discovered that the delivery driver was coming, but was running late.  They didn’t arrive until 5:20.  After all the furniture parts and mattresses were brought into the house, the delivery driver tells us that all of the hardware is missing.  We were told that they will request new hardware to be mailed to us, and that once we get the hardware, they will come back and assemble the bed.  Later that evening, we received a phone call from Customer Service to see how delivery went, and explained at that time the situation with the missing hardware.  We were told to expect shipment of new hardware in 3 to 5 business days. \n\n3 business days later on Wedensday, July 19, we still hadn’t received the hardware, nor had we been notified that a shipment is on the way.  That afternoon, we called Customer Service only to be told that as far as they can tell, no shipment had gone out.  We were told that the hardware would be overnighted to us, and that we should receive the package the following day.  We explained over the phone the importance of having the bed assembled by Saturday due to guests coming.  We were assured that once we had the hardware in hand, we could call back and have same day assembly scheduled.\n\nThursday July 20 we receive an email confirming that the overnight shipment had just left, and to expect the delivery by a major parcel service on Friday July 21.  So again, we were lied to.  We called customer service and explained that major parcel service company delivers to us very late in the evening, often as late as 8 PM, and that if that is the case, we would miss our chance to call back and have same day delivery.  We explained that we 100% needed the assembly done on Saturday and attempted to schedule the assembly.  We were told that assembly could not be scheduled until we had the hardware in hand.  BUT, we were assured that if we called back first thing Saturday morning, it would be no problem to get same day assembly.  On Friday July 21, around 8:15 PM, we received the hardware.\n\nSaturday morning July 22, at exactly 8 AM, we called customer service to request same day assembly.  We were told that an email needed to be sent to the service department and that we’d get a call back once they had a scheduled time.  Based on the tone of the conversation, we were expecting a quick response.  Around 10:30, we still didn’t have a call back, so we called again.  This time we were told the very same thing – the agent would need to contact the service department by email, and we would get a call back once a time is scheduled.  By 1, we still hadn’t heard back.  We knew that our chances of getting that same day assembly were dimming, so we called back.  We were told that the reason we hadn’t received a phone call yet is that so far there had been no response from the service department regarding when they could come out and assemble our bed.  20 minutes or so after that phone call, we received a call checking in and were told that there was no available service technicians to come out, but that there were several delivery drivers in the area, and one of them would come out and do the assembly.  We were told to just hang tight and wait on a phone call to let us know what time.\n\nWe got that phone call around 3:30, and the response wasn’t good.  We were not going to get the bed assembled that day, and in fact, it would be Tuesday before anyone could come out.  We were told our delivery fee would get refunded (we paid that in cash), and basically sorry about your troubles.  We ended up going out and purchasing a hide away guest bed for $185 just so our guest would have a bed to sleep in. \n\nOn Monday, July 24, we attempted to get the approximate time that the service technician would come out on Tuesday by contacting customer service through chat.  We were told that unfortunately no time could be given other than between 8 AM and 10 PM because this was a rush assembly, and not a scheduled time.  We confirmed that although they couldn't give us an exact time, we were in fact scheduled for an assembly on Tuesday.  The answer was simply \"Correct.\" So again I took a day off work to wait on a service technician.  They gave us such a wide range of time, that we simply waited and waited.  at 6 PM, we decided to call the store to vent our frustrations that we are still here waiting on an assembly.  We were told by the manager that \"if it hasn't happened yet, you're not getting an assembly done today, because the latest they work is 5 PM.\"  The store manager called customer service on our behalf.  About an hour later, we got a call back saying that we were never told Tuesday, but instead told \"Tuesday or Wednesday\" and that in fact it would be Wednesday morning before the technician was in our area to assemble the bed.  Because of the lies and half-truths we’ve been told throughout this ordeal, we're in doubt that anyone is coming this morning. \n\nOverall we’ve had a good shopping experience and have had good luck with our purchases.  But this last purchase has really soured us on them.  We sent a detailed complaint yesterday in an email to them that very much mirrors this post.  So far no response, and so far no appearance of our Wednesday morning service technician.  Here's hoping someone arrives by noon.\n\n*UPDATE*\nSO no one came this morning. We called at 11, someone was to call us back. That didn't happen. We called at 1, didn't get a call back until 3, and we were told someone would be here between 4 and 5. By 5, no one had showed. Finally someone showed at 5:40. During the bed assembly he came back out and said \"you're not going to like this. There are still some parts missing.\" We were missing two legs, two posts, and the trundle wasn't sliding properly. They offered to either mail us the parts and schedule another service, or a full return and replacement on Friday. We took the latter. Someone is supposed to call us tomorrow and give us our delivery time. Not holding my breath. Throughout all this, we haven't had a single \"smooth things over\" conversation with a manager or any higher-ups. No one seems to care whether we are happy or not, or whether we will shop there again or not.  ",

We knew to check that the overage was being applied to the principle, but other than that didn't really do any of the maths.\n \nOne day we got had a little discussion and realized we had no idea when we would actually pay off our house.  No problem, we had our mortgage statement right here.  I gave them a call, expecting that they could answer the question with ease, what with them being a mortgage company and all.  The following conversation is paraphrased, but you get the idea.  The rep spoke English with perhaps a hint of an accent, but clearly and fluently enough that I don't think there was any sort of language barrier. \n\nMe:  Hi, we've been overpaying each month by $100 bucks, when will our loan be paid off?\n\nRep: You've been sending a different amount than what is on your statement?\n\nMe: Correct.  An extra $100, applied to the principle.  On the statement our maturation date hasn't changed, so I want to know when we will be paid off.\n\nRep: Ma'am, you HAVE to inform us in advance if make a change in your payment.\n\nMe: (Very puzzled now) What?  No, I don't.  You take the money and apply it correctly just fine.  I just want to know when we will be paid off at the rate we are going.\n\nRep: You need your monthly payment changed then?\n\nMe: No!  It's fine.  I want to keep the original amount in case we run into tough times and have to stop overpaying.  But assuming that doesn't happen, when will we be paid off?\n\nRep:  Thank you for letting us know about the tough times and understand we are willing to work with you.  \n\nMe: Wait..\n\nRep: We understand that things are tough for many of customers and I'm sure we can make some changes that might benefit you in these difficult times.\n\nMe: Um... no, please don't change anything.  Have you changed anything?\n\nRep: No Ma'am, but I am here to help anytime.\n\nMe: Um... someone's at the door, I'll call back later, thanks.\n\nI hang up and recounted the conversation to my husband.  We were both shaking our heads when I suddenly realized that the rep was simply following a script for people who were behind on their payments and were calling for help.  I know that happens but I really doubt that we're only people who pay a bit extra each month.  I never did call back and get the answer from them.\n\nWe finally did find the answer by using an online mortgage calculator.  Just about a year and half to go!  Assuming the rep doesn't change something, of course.  ",

        "text": "So this happened years ago in an establishment similar to John in the Bag. \n\nMy friend and I were out running errands and decided to stop for some lunch around noon. We notice the drive thru is absolutely slammed, no biggie we'll dine inside. We're next in line as an older woman gets in line behind us; she will be know known as OW. \n\nAn aside my friend and I, at the time of this story, had both worked fast food and customer service for years. I was on my way out of the industry he would leave it a couple years later. I'm 6'5\" with long hair and a patched jacket filled with mostly metal bands. My friend is 5\"10 jet black hair and is in a patch jacket filled with mostly horror punk bands.\n\nThe cashier takes my order and runs back to lift the fries out of the fryer and is back at the counter in 30 seconds top he practically running. In fact everyone behind the counter is as close as they can be to running in such a small area.\n\nWe're getting our drinks as we hear OW huffing and grumbling through ordering a bunch of food to go. We're seated at this point and watch OW, because she doing that oh so familiar impatient dance of craning her neck back and forth trying to see all of the kitchen, with her hand on her hip. She's got her receipt clutched and it's slowly being crumpled into a ball. It's been probably 3 minutes since OW has finished ordering so of course it's time to start complaining.\n\nOW: Excuse me!? EXCUSE ME?!\n\nCashier:(coming back from the fryer) Yes mam, what can I help you with?\n\nOW: Where the hell is my food! This is supposed to be fast food!\n\nCashier: I'm sorry mam it's going to be a few more minutes. \n\nOur trays are getting put together so we get up to wait for them so they don't have to walk them out. The cashier put the fries down first and she starts in.\n\nOW: You fucking idiots! I said TO GOOOOOO!!!! First you're slow and now you fuck up my order. You people are fucking useless.\n\nYears of dealing with customers rose in me and I realized I don't work here, I can't get fired for yelling at her.\n\nMe: Hey shut the fuck up! These people are busting their ass! Have you never heard of a lunch rush?\n\nFriend: They are fucking running! Not one person is standing around. There are cars wrapped around the building and that's our food you fucking idiot.\n\nOW whipped around, turned pale, and sat down. I don't think she was prepared for the sight and sound of us. \n\nI apologized to the cashier who looked like he saw a unicorn and we took our food. OW snatched her bags as soon as they were ready and grumbled her way out the door.",

If anyone can think of a better place for this story let me know.\n\nI should start by saying that I have a reasonably well paying job in sales.

My family has no savings whatsoever and each month is a struggle with bills etc.  \n\nCompleting this years tax return, I came to the dread realisation that I am going to have a $6000 tax bill.  So i go to my bank to explore options of consolidation of all these debts into my home loan.  \n\nTo my surprise the numbers look great.  So great in fact that I will easily be spending over $1300 less each month.  I get a little bit excited at the fact that I might actually be able to start a savings account.  So I submit all relevant documents for the loan application expecting a fast turnaround (first mistake).  \n\nI am called by the loan officer informing me that my salaried wage is not sufficient to make repayments and that they can't proceed with the application.

        "text": "I don't know if any of y'all have experienced this, but sometimes there is a chain that you love that is completely ubiquitous all throughout your local area, but you tend to avoid the closest one due to... reasons. For me, it's a certain sub sandwich joint. It tends to be relatively fast, customizeable, and at least palatable, so everyone in my family --from my little brother who will only eat a sandwich with just roast beef on it, to my father who has to have pretty much everything in the store on it-- can find something that they like. \n\nAnd, luckily for me, there is a restaurant of this particular chain within walking distance from my house, and, even better, biking distance so I can bike down there fill up the basket with warm sandwiches, and head on home with food for the whole family like an old-timey cartoon. But I don't go to that restaurant anymore. One of the characters there that made me realize that it had one of the highest concentrations of weirdos in my town was the man I have dubbed The Spicy Mustard Guy, or SMG for short. \n\nAs I was waiting to give my order one day that began like any other day, I had the pleasure of finding myself stuck behind SMG. Now, SMG was one of the most peculiar individuals I had the pleasure of feasting my eyes upon. He was the spitting image of Mac from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, down to the ripped sleeves and tribal tattoos. I live in a very, very Mormon town in suburban Utah. Hipsters are sort of a mythical beast that you hear about living beyond the wall. It was quite a shock to see one in person. \n\nSMG's order went as following: he demanded four slices of roast beef, six banana peppers, four olives, two slices of swiss, a slice of pepperjack, three pickles, two tomatoes, and four onion slices. Now, obviously, I'm taking a creative liberty with the exact amounts of toppings here, but you get the general idea, and I have a semi-eidetic memory. When SMG got to the sauces is when it got really fun, though. He wanted one squirt of mayonnaise, two squirts of vinegar and oil, three squirts of oil. Oh, and the spicy mustard. Oh, the spicy mustard, indeed. He asked for \"just the precum of the spicy mustard.\" At this point, the obviously flustered sandwich artist, underpaid and underqualified for such a specific order --especially while there were customers both in front of and behind SMG-- looked up at SMG with a helpless, dear in the headlights look, and said, \"what?\" \n\n\"Just the precum of the spicy mustard\" affirmed SMG, who I began to postulate may of truly been Mac. The Sandwich artist --to his credit-- showed that he did, indeed know what SMG meant by the precum, and squirted out a gross splat of honey mustard (the only thing that SMG could have been referring to) onto the unholy concoction that was his sandwich. It is worth mentioning that SMG was with another man who appeared to be in his mid-to-late twenties --although he was dressed in the more typical fashion of the American young adult-- who put his face into his hands as mustard ejaculate was launched into SMG's entree. Noticing his friend's disgust, SMG, turns to him and says \"What? It's so good, dude. It has to be perfect.\" SMG's friend ordered a normal sandwhich and they left without further incident, but other happenings involving even stranger individuals led me to stop going to this establishment entirely, even though it did always create good stories to tell.

        "text": "I think this post belongs here, if not I apologize (and let me know in the comments!).\n\nOkay, so me and a friend went to a local museum.  He had special passes to a new exhibit.  He had tried to go to a museum event before but due to the weather they had to cancel (snow!), and as a courtesy gave him tickets to this exhibit.  Totally unnecessary for the museum to do, but appreciated nonetheless.  It's a free museum pass, right?  \n\nOkay, well we show up at the museum on an evening, as yes this museum does have evening hours (isn't our city cool?).  Usually at night you can visit the special exhibits, and then the main museum gets rented out to parties, weddings, etc.  Well on this particular night the museum is FULL of children, in addition there is also a wedding party.  So it's packed!  Apparently the museum had decided to host a sleep over for children, giving them the opportunity to experience a museum after dark.  Although based on the anguished faces of parents, it seemed like they had to stay too--it wasn't museum daycare for teenaged children.  Anyway, we see the exhibit and meh, not really that great.  But again, it's free, so can't complain.  I just really felt bad for those people who did pay, as the exhibit truly didn't offer much.  \n\nOkay, so we prepare to leave but before doing so my friend has to use the bathroom.  Luckily, it's right outside the exhibit, and the exhibit closes in two hours so I just stand at the end of the exhibit.  Other patrons are nearby watching the different museum pieces and my friend is presumably doing his business.  About a minute goes by when a young museum worker (YW) comes up to me (M) and, before she starts talking, begins to shake.  \n\nYW- excuse me, what are you doing here?\n\nM- I was in the exhibit, now I'm waiting for my friend to return from the restroom.\n\nYW- (appears very anxious and on the verge of tears??)\n\nYW- I'm going to have to ask you to leave the museum.\n\nM- Okay, like I said just waiting for my friend.\n\nYW- Again, you must leave the museum right now.\n\nNothing came of it.  My friend actually came out of the bathroom at that moment and we walked out.  I don't begrudge the museum, I understand they want peace and order and safety--but I literally challenged none of that.  It just puzzled my mind.  I told my friend about the encounter, who caught the tail end, and we both felt that she appeared new and likely forgot that the special exhibits were open after hours.  Thus I went from someone standing at the end of a special exhibit--and as such anyone would assume is at the exhibit--to someone who was in a closed museum full of private events.  So yea, still not sure why the museum worker was so frazzled but whatever--I guess we all have frazzle-worthy days?\n\nEdit- formatting",

        "text": "I just found this sub and boy do I have a story. I had just sold my house and was moving to my new house. As a result I had extra money on hand and no way to prepare meals for that week. So I ate out a lot. The extra money is relevant because I don't eat out unless I am able to tip well. \n\nSo I stop with my SO at \"pancake restaurant\" for a quick and cheap breakfast. Right of the bat every employee in there is stiff and uncomfortable. Our server is a very nice girl and she does her best to be a quality server. I could tell she was up against something but I assumed it was an overworked and frustrated cook. As we are eating our food, a loud crash comes from the kitchen and then yelling. Tons of profanity that gets louder as a man barrels out of the back and starts slamming things down. The other customers begin to scurry and rush to pay. \n\nThen our waitress comes out with red eyes from obvious crying. She tries very hard to stay calm but her voice is shaking. The man storms back into the back and more slamming happens. I ask her what the fuck is happening and she explains that the man is the manager and he has a bad temper. I tell her she should quit because that's some terrifying behavior from a manager. She explains that she can't until the end of the week. She has another job offer but needs to fix her car first. She is only $50 short and needs the week to save it up. \n\nBy this point, my SO and I are the only customers left. I ask her for my check and pay. Then I tip her $100 and tell her she really should quick. I assumed her story was likely BS but the way the guy berated her, I didn't care. \n\nTurns out, her story was true. As I was leaving he came out yelling again and she calmly grabbed her things and told him she quit. As we left he started going off. I was terrified at this point and then every single employee exited the store and left. I gave the girl my number and she kept in touch to show me her repaired car and even gave us a free  meal at her new place.\n\nFortunately, I was really pissed. I'm not confrontational but I don't mind calling corporate. It turns out he is the owner and thinks he can do whatever he pleases. However, he was renting the restaurant name (not sure what that's called) and they weren't too happy about my call. The employees also called to report him. Corporate called me back with $100 in gift cards and let me know that that location would no longer hold the \"pancake restaurant\" name. A month later the building was abandoned. \n\nThe waitress told me that the other employees quit but we're offered jobs at other locations by corporate. The owner trashed the place and then dissappeared when the business name was pulled. \n\nIt is by far the most insane situation I had ever has as a customer. I am generally quite poor so I was really glad I had some extra money to help the server out of there. She only got the job because she could walk there while her car was broken. Day two on the job, that man bought the place. She had only been there a month when the incident happened. He managed to anger his business into the ground in single month.",

I'm not gonna give the brand of cinema, but it was A Mediocre Cinema.\n\nSo we get to A Mediocre Cinema, and this is one of those places where there is no real snack bar or anything.  There's a real bar for alcohol in the lobby, but any food you buy is done inside the individual theater.  For those unfamiliar, there's a button on the arm rest that you push and someone will come up, take your order, and come out with your order.  You pay at the end like you would at a restaurant.\n\nWe get to our theater where we're about to watch Tom Hiddleston be handsome while Samuel L. Jackson gets angry at a monkey.  We got to the theater about 10 minutes early, so we sit down, push the button, and wait.\n\n10 minutes go by.  That's fine.  The theater doesn't look very full, but there are like six other theaters that could be packed.  Whatever.\n\n20 minutes go by.  The actual non-show-up-early trailers are about to wrap up.  Nobody still.  I get up and go out to the lobby to fetch someone.  There are three people leaning on the front desk when I get out there, but they apologize and send someone up.  We end up taking our order right as the movie starts (popcorn, drinks, and nachos).  A little annoying, but problem solved, right?\n\nSo now we're in the movie's time.\n\nTwenty-ish minutes pass.  Tom Hiddleston has shown up already.  He's being all handsome and shit, and we still don't have our popcorn, nachos, or drinks.\n\nForty minutes pass.  No way this shit is taking *that* long.  I go out to the lobby to complain.  A bored looking woman tells me that they're working on the order.\n\n70 minutes pass.  Still nothing.  I go out again and tell them to just cancel the order as it's taking way too long.  A new lady profusely apologizes and says the order will be right out.\n\n90 minutes pass.  A woman with popcorn, drinks, and nachos walks into the theater.  She looks at the crowd, looks at the screen, shrugs, and walks the fuck out of the theater.  I go to chase her down - mostly out of curiosity at this point - but she vanished into the goddamn ether.\n\nSo the movie ends and we don't get any delicious treats.  That's where the story *should* end, but wait, there's more!  One of the employees is walking up to our seat, I imagine to apologize, and he hands us a check.  They charged us for the shit we didn't even get.  So I chase that guy down and politely, yet firmly explain to him that we not paying for the food we didn't get.  He stutters that it's not his job to deduct payments, which I understand, so I ask him to grab someone who *can*.\n\nSo we get out to the lobby with our check and this small lady takes it from us, apologizes, and gives us free coupons for food, popcorn, and sodas for the next time we come back to the A Mediocre Cinema...  Which I'm sure we won't get when we try to spend them.\n\nTL;DR: Kong Skull Island was okay, 6/10 would probably watch on an airplane.",

        "text": "THIS IS A LONG POST (although maybe it just looks long because I'm on mobile). \n\nAs a preface, this is a story about my (I'll call myself RG) experience with an airline that has been in the news a lot recently (and not for good reasons). Also, an important fact is that I'm a Canadian who lives in Canada. \n\nI'm a student at a Caribbean school, and since I obviously can't drive down there, I have to fly. Since I live in Canada, I have my choice of airlines; the slightly more expensive company (Company 1) which takes me from my home town to Toronto, and then directly to the Caribbean, or the cheaper company (Company 2) which takes me from my home town down to Houston, then UP to Newark, keeps me there overnight, and then sends me on my way to the Caribbean. Total travel time with Company 1: about 10 hours. Total travel time with Company 2: about 30 hours. \n\nOn my way back home last December, my booking was with Company 2. My flight plan was the same (Caribbean - Newark - overnight stay - Houston - Home), with a total travel time nearing 30 hours. But hey, it's cheap right? Gotta save money as a student, no matter where you study. So I get to the Caribbean airport on December 1st (not the real date) and wait there for 9 hours before being told that my flight has been canceled due to mechanical issues. Alright, that's fine, shit happens and I'd rather fly on a mechanically intact plane if it's all the same to you, thanks. However, this obviously meant that I'd miss my connections, but whatever, once I'm back in the States I'd be able to book my flights with impunity, or so I thought. I was told to show up at the airport for the same flight at the same time on December 2nd. So I went back to the student housing and stayed up all night trying to rebook at least one connecting flight in advance. \n\nCue December 2nd. The scene is set. RG has checked in his bag (not overweight, that's important later) and is through security, and is just waiting for the plane to board. It's an hour late. Two hours. Four hours. Finally RG is told that because the flight crew is \"over their flight time for today,\" the flight has been moved to December 3rd. Cue groans and exasperation. RG collects his checked bag for the second day in a row, and once again, all the plans and connecting flights that were booked have to be canceled. Now RG is getting frustrated, but he still tries to book flights in advance, in anticipation of his arrival in Newark. \n\nOn December 3rd, I finally got on the plane and flew out to Newark. The flight was uneventful, but Company 2 wasn't done with me yet. Not by a long shot. I arrived in Newark, collected my checked bag, found a hotel, and slept like a baby until 2 AM, at which point I had to go back to the airport to check in for my 5 AM flight to Houston. Once back at the airport (around 2:30), I was told by Company 2 personnel that I couldn't check in my bag until two hours prior to the flight. At 3 AM, I was the first person in line and I went to check in my bag, and suddenly it was overweight. Not just by a little bit. By a full 12 lbs. Now I'm not a physicist, but I'm pretty sure that gravity works the same in the Caribbean as it does in Newark, and when I first checked in my bag, it was not overweight by even a single pound. Considering that I went from the Newark airport to the hotel and back with my bag, I can see why the Company 2 staff thought I added stuff to my bag, but I know that I didn't. So now I'm taken off to the side and told that I need to pay a $200 USD fee to let my bag on the plane. I refuse because I think it's an issue with their scale (surprisingly, everyone behind me in line who used that scale had overweight bags too, by about 5-10 lbs), but of course the staff refuse to believe me. It's now 3:45, and I've been arguing with the manager about how my bag is NOT overweight, and how they need to reweigh it. Finally, the manager tells me to WAIT THERE as his staff takes my bag to a different scale, and they come back saying it's overweight. It's now 4:00. My flight boards in 20 mins and leaves in an hour. I say fuck it and pay the fee, and rush to security. \n\nLong story short, the security line was out the door, I got \"randomly searched\" by a TSA agent who also took my ticket and decided that since it was 4:45 (by the time I reached the front of the line), it was too late for me to board my flight and they had no reason to help me out by expediting the whole process. Which is fine. Whatever. Fuck TSA. \n\nI end up missing my connection to Houston, and have to book a flight to Chicago, and from there, mercifully, I get home safe and sound. \n\nAfter a month of phone calls and negotiating with Company 2, I get my $200 USD in \"overweight\" fees refunded, as well as a $450 USD Travel Certificate for \"inconveniences faced\" to be applied to any Company 2 flight. Cool, sounds good, thanks for all the fish. Maybe Company 2 isn't that bad, and I just had an unfortunately shitty experience. \n\nCue the month of June. RG is trying to book a flight back to Caribbean for the end of July and use the $450 credit as well. He finds a Company 2 flight that goes from his hometown to Toronto, and then from Toronto to the Caribbean. Total travel time: about 10 hours. He calls Company 2 to book the flight and apply the credit and lo and behold, he can't. \n\nCompany 2 reps told me that I couldn't apply the credit to the flight plan I chose because the first part of the flight (from my hometown to Toronto) was operated by Company 1, DESPITE being shown as a flight offered by Company 2 on Company 2's website, and DESPITE having a flight code that reflects Company 2. I was pissed. I was given a flight credit for \"inconveniences faced,\" but now it was a hassle to apply the credit. \n\nAs for the diarrhea frosting on this shit cake? The only alternative suggested by the Company 2 reps was for me to change my flight plan and go from my hometown to Houston to Newark, stay there overnight, and then to the Caribbean. Total travel time? You guessed it. 30. Fucking. Hours. For a 10 hour journey. \n\nOf course I demanded to speak to their Customer Care department, only to be told that they can't be reached by phone, and that I would have to submit an online form, and \"they might get back to you within 21 days.\" What? So as the flight costs are going up daily, and I have less than 20 days left in my hometown before I have to leave, I'm supposed to wait for up to 21 days for a Customer Care department who \"might get back\" to me? \n\nLong story short, the only way to use the credit I received for \"inconveniences faced\" was to inconvenience myself again. Fuck. That. Shit. \n\nThere's no happy ending here, folks, at least for my story with Company 2. I booked my flights with Company 1 for a 10 hour journey in comfort (and no TSA ass probes), and Company 2 can go fuck themselves with a plane-sized dildo. \n\nIt should fit with their plane-sized loopholes. \n\n\n",

Me (B) and my buddy (S) were getting a few things for a session of D&amp;D that we had forgotten; namely chips, guac, and two packs of sodas.  All in all, it was four items, so we go to the self checkout lane to avoid the huge lines of regular checkout.\n\nUnfortunately, all the self checkout things are occupied, but it's five items or less, so we stand a good two meters behind this one woman who looks almost done and shoot the shit while we're waiting.  Eventually she finishes and we start checking out.  That's when the self checkout lady (who I guess is there to make sure no one steals anything) gets in our business.\n\nSCL: Excuse me.\n\nUs: Huh?\n\nSCL: I'm going to have to ask you to be more courteous of other customers or we can't let you shop here.\n\nMe and my friend look at each other obviously confused.\n\nMe: I'm not sure we know what you're talking about...?\n\nSCL: The woman in front of you made it clear that she felt *very* uncomfortable and even threatened by how close you were standing to her.  She said you were intentionally intimidating her.\n\nFirstly, the distance thing was absolute crap, as we were standing far enough behind this lady to let other carts pass in front of us.  The funny part, though, was the intimidation bit.  Remember how I said my friend and I were grabbing stuff for D&amp;D?  We *look* like guys who would play D&amp;D.  He wears glasses and has a six pack...  that he drank to fuel his beer belly, and I'm 5'7\" and wearing a graphic t-shirt with Mario on it, jeans, and sandals.  We don't exactly look the part of the two thugs who are going to wreck your shit while shopping for snacks.  Also, if by \"intentionally intimidating\" she meant talking about Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, she was right on the money.  Anyway, I chose to respond:\n\nMe: Well, if she had a problem with us, she could have said it to us herself.  We would have backed up a few more feet.\n\nSCL: But you didn't back up then.\n\nS: Yeah dude.  We should have read her mind because we're fucking psychics.\n\nI start cackling, but SCL just looked really offended and asked us to leave.  We were told we'd not be welcomed back by her, but we've been there about 70 times since then, so I don't think she passed the memo.",

I called them last week to let them know that I had a package that had mistakenly been shipped to the wrong address.  (Second time from this particular company..)  The woman on the phone asked me if I still had the package and then proceeded to inform me of how I should  be returning the package to my mail carrier.  I told her very nicely that most companies schedule a pickup for their property and that I've never seen my mail carrier, but I could leave it for them with a note. She then asked me if the package had been addressed to me and if not, why couldn't I get it returned.  \nIf anyone wants some free coffee, I'm leaving it out on my front stoop with a note for the USPS mail carrier.

        "text": "I randomed in here a few days ago and got to remember this delightful experience. As I wrote this I got into it and turned my brief story into a tale for (hopefully) your amusement, pending pretty formatting. This is a tale of hunger, wasted time, lies and disappointment, and a happy ending.\n\nShort term lurker;FTP\n\nTL;DR at the bottom and full disclosure - kinda anti-climactic but I had fun writing it out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA few years ago in my undergrad we were doing work as a group, finally finish it, and decide to go get drinks and diner at a restaurant named after fruit and honey-maker. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI present the cast:\n\n9levels - yours truly. Really nice guy, smiles alot.\n\nGB - GoodBuddy of mine. Mild mannered man with a taste for beer and a wicked Texas accent.\n\nFF - ForeignFriend. Hailing from African, the sweetest girl I knew in that city and arguably the smartest of us but still learning how to MURICA!\n\nServerMan - the tragic antagonist and unintentional victim of this tale.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNormal, slightly busy evening crowd about 9-9:30 on a weeknight. Come in and grab a table near the bar (yay college drinks). ServerMan comes up after a few minutes and he's nice enough. Obviously a little rushed and flustered, so I assume they're short a person or two. All's well that ends well. We order water and a round of inebriation juice to look over the menu, planning to take it easy since we were celebrating the tough assignment being done. This worked out even better for the server because he was busy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe comes back almost 10 minutes later to empty glasses and a few questions because FF wanted to know about substitutions. I reorder the glasses of water (because they haven't shown up yet) and we declare out next round of carbonated happiness.\n\n\"No problem guys, I'll get that right out!\" he says. I'm a little suspicious on the right out part but as long as my cup is full I'm happy. This is also a good time to mention I usually tip 10-20%+(based on refills)+(pleasant human bonus) based on the check amount. So here we are complaining about that assignment and after 10 minutes out comes the water. \n\n\"Thanks ServerMan\" I say, being thirsty, \"by the way, those beers about ready?\"\n\nI catch him stutter ever so slightly as he replies \"Just about, let me go check.\" This was particularly interesting to me given we were 4 feet from the bar and I'd not seen a beer being poured in quite a while, none the less three beers at once. I see where this is going..... so I slow down and start milking my water. GB really like his MoolerNotHeavy so he's getting a bit flustered. FF is starting to wonder why we haven't been able to order yet..... This doesn't seem to be an issue in Africa and Europe.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAbout 15 minutes later we're all running in dry mode and have chewed up all the ice in out waters. Fortunately this angel has procured three glasses of \"I can still drive\". He drops the off and does an immediate 180. BAM! We're getting pretty hungry and sitting on 20 minutes of knowing what to order.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"Whoa there! We're ready to order.\" I state.\n\nThe server manages to execute another flawless 180. Notepad in hand by time he stabilizes with a polite \"Great! What can I get yall tonight?\"\n\nWe state our orders and all is back to how it should be. Normally this place should have food out in about 10-15 minutes. Take it easy on the drinks and we can order round three when he delivers food.\n\nWe wait but hunger encroaches and makes college students get grumpy. The glasses slowly lose their amber color and become clear and we still have no back up beverage... GB get up and heads to order direct from the bar, which we had avoided for courtesy to our server and his tip. Magically ServerMan show up but... he has neither food nor drink but only bad news.......after 15-20 minutes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTurns out that the kitchen is out of RICE. No problem for any of us, really. FF was disappointed because she really wanted rice with her chicken. A short conversation resulted is mashed potato as a substitution for me and veggies for me. GB had ordered steak. This was just a continuation of him not being able to eat.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIts getting bad. We have nothing to drink. His tip is plummeting. ServerMan has mastered the shadow dance! I'm irritated but impressed (actually just irritated and thirsty).\n\nUNTIL! A new table across the aisle get filled with a cute couple, sitting on the same side of a booth in a shady corner. WHOOSH ServerMan appears and proceeds just like before - greetings, drinks, brb. My irritation grows when they get their drinks in less time and manage to order food before he melds into the walls again. I flag him down before he finishes his Naruto styled vanishing hand signals and near plead for anything wet, which he politely confirms his willingness to accommodate. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis part of the story is where we started to contemplate our situation. About 15 minutes after the couple had ordered, ServerMan shows up with our drinks and floats over to the couple. I bend an ear to try and glean an excuse of this horrendous delay that we were not privy to. This was the point of no return.\n\nAs politely as he could, he tells the couple these exact words, \"Sorry for the delay, but I've just found out the kitchen is out of rice.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat?\n\nAs he dissipates into fog, I contemplate if this man is actually human or not then relay this to breaking new to my starving compatriots. We meditate on our definitely-not-half-full-glasses-of-not-so-happy-anymore juice. After a sad few moments we agree to give the guy a bit more time to produce three plates of much needed food.\n\n2 minutes\n\n5 minutes\n\n10 minutes\n\nNope. Eff this. I paper napkin the math of the I'm-way-too-sober suds we had consumed, asked if anyone had cash. GB and FF shake their head. I toss enough cash on the table to confidently cover the drinks and we leave. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs you can guess we were still very hungry. Disgruntled, GB headed home to a fridge full of MoolerNotHeavy and some leftovers. I took FF home and we stopped at every Texan's favorite 24 hour burger place. Food was ready in just over 5 minutes. This really helped lighten our moods.\n\nHappy ending time =] \n\n* GB survived the ordeal and graduated from college a few months later and re-enrolled as a master's student the next semester. \n\n~screen fade and brighten~\n\n* FF graduated the same semester as GB but couldn't find a company that would sponsor her. She got a weak job but got to stay here, where she met a nice guy (I think). After saving up money, I fully expect her to get a master's degree too.\n\n~screen fade and brighten~\n\n* I graduated a year later and entered a master's program in another city. Neither one of us ever returned to that restaurant or any other one of the same name as far as I know.\n\n~screen fade and brighten~\n\n* As for ServerMan, no one knows what happened to him. I imagine he has moved on to better places where his capabilities were greatly appreciated, or at least not abused.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR** Friends went to celebrate finishing a tough assignment. Server was overwhelmed and probably got shafted by the kitchen. Took forever to do anything then told a nearby table the same lie he told me. We paid for beers and left after well over an hour with no food. No servers or customers were hurt during the events described above.\n\nI don't blame ServerMan for what happened and never confronted him but I'm still angry about the whole experience. Yes walking out was probably not the best thing to do but courtesy ended when lies and willful ignorance started and my cup doth not runneth over.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading everyone\n\nEdit: SFW'd bad word",

This is a bit of a rant and advice about my shopping experience yesterday morning.\n\nI drop by a local drug store to get some basic shopping done and grab a few basics, toilet paper, shampoo, and such. I'm going to checkout when this John Doe sees me and just sighs. I'm thinking 'okay maybe he's just tired, smile and let's get this done quickly'. As he rings my stuff up I ask him about a sale going on and the store point system change and how to apply mine, and he turns 180 on me. He goes off on me about, *'I don't know anything! You can't use points. Call corporate if you want to know so much. I had to fire employee X and employee Y was my friend and they got in trouble'*. I'm pretty calm and just ask for the manager, because she/he probably knows more and he says, *' I am the manger'* then he walks away from the register on his phone... \n\nI'm pretty confused at what just happened when another employee sees me. She helps me out and answers about the sale because they recently changed their store point system. She wouldn't let me use my store point credit because the manager would get mad at her? I tell her who John Doe was, and she tells me, 'he's the new manager'.\n\nI didn't yell, or get angry, but I still feel upset that he blew up on me and walked away from me on his cell phone. A, 'employee Z will help you' would have gone a long way. It turned what was suppose to be a quick trip into easily 10+ minutes. I already did the survey on the receipt and am upset I wasn't allowed to use about $5 worth of store point credits. Is this something I should call corporate over? Am I over reacting?\n\n* John Doe is not his real name. \n\n",
