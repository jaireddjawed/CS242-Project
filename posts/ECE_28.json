But how hard it is to go from RF system level design to RFIC design? Should I take the RF system level design offer and work my way up to RFIC design position in the same company? Or should I do a Master degree and look for RFIC design job? I think that I will get to do RFIC design faster if I continue my education and do a Master, but will it make me a better RFIC design engineer to have a few years of RF system level design experience first? Tbh I only like RFIC design so I can worry about layout optimization, but I don't really mind doing RF system design.\nAnyone went from RF system level design to RFIC design can you tell me was it hard to make that move?",

Obviously that's almost an oxymoronic statement since for RF you need to do EM and parasitic extraction, but even as an ideal model it'd be nice. \n\nThis is a demo PDK from Silvaco using publicly available data from MOSIS. I can't find the MOSIS source since the only one I know is the ON C5/AMI 0.5um spice library everyone uses in intro to digital/analog. The one that NCSU distributes. \n\nBut after signing up there you go! I think that's still kinda useful for someone out there. \n\nYou get MIM Caps, Inductors and Varactors! That's fairly dope. Plus voltage references can be made using actual Diodes and BJTs unlike a pure CMOS process where getting CTAT/PTAT for your BGR needs parastic exploits. \n\nSizes are kinda huge honestly, like 0.24/0.5um L/W ratio, so I'm guessing some multigiga scale is out of the question, but for people just interested it doesn't seem all that bad. \n\nI'm going to try it in LT and NGSpice, haven't had the chance to yet so I don't know how good it will be. I'm going to see if any layout work can be done in Electric, otherwise I have to load this setup into the Cadence/Synopsis server at school. Since I've graduated I have to request an account again so that's kind of a pain. \n\nJust wanted to put this out there in case someone might find it useful.",

When I plot it normally (probing the node above the cap), I see the -3dB (about half the input voltage) frequency at around 160Hz. This makes sense because it makes the impedance of the capacitor roughly 1k, which is the same as the value of R1.\n\nNow, when I go to change the manual limits to logarithmic voltage like in the video, I would expect to see .5V at that same frequency. However, when I move the trace along the amplitude curve I'm getting .5V at around 275Hz now. How can this be? Is there something I'm not taking into account here, or is the program being buggy?",

        "text": "I've been working on a headphone amplifier design, and I'd like to work to incorporate a DAC. My current choice is the TI's [PCM2707](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/pcm2707.pdf), so I can use a USB without an extra chip. However, I'm having trouble figuring out how to use it properly.\n\nMy plan for powering the headphone amplifier is with a USB supply, and then running the +5V into an isolated DC-DC 5V-9V converter, which then runs into a rail splitter, creating a virtual ground at 4.5V. The input is currently just planned as TRS, but I’d like to now incorporate the DAC to add another input (USB). \n\nI'm confused about a number of things. My main source of confusion is in regards to pins 13 &amp; 16, VCCL and VCCR. Would I connect these pins to my +9V supply? Or are these part of some sort of internal amplifier?\n\nOn the typical circuit connection (page 28 on the datasheet), why is VDD tied to the positive data line? Do I need R2 if I'm not used external ROM?\n\nIn regards to analog and digital grounds, which I know must be separate, would the GND on the USB line be the DGND and the virtual ground (4.5V) formed by the rail splitter be the AGND? What about PGND and ZGND? \n\nI'd like to also allow for a 3.5mm TRS input. Will I run into any issues tying the outputs of that connector to the VOUTL and VOUTR of the DAC? Any precautions to take?\n\nAs you can see, I'm a bit confused here, and definitely want to know what I'm doing before I put anything together. If there's anything else anyone can think of about mixed signal PCB design, I'd love to hear it all.",

        "text": "I wanted to control a device operating on 24V from an MCU. I bought a few [ULN2003a's](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/f3/6e/c8/64/4d/b3/4e/38/CD00001244.pdf/files/CD00001244.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00001244.pdf). What I didn't realize is they're intended to act as a sink, not a source. I discovered this when testing and realized that I have to have the LED go *into* the \"output\" to drive it. I haven't worked with a BJT before and I don't think I really understood what I was doing. \n\nThe device I have has 4 inputs that accept 24V and one ground. As far as I'm aware, there is no way for me to wire it with this chip. I don't think the 2003a is really designed for what I'm trying to do. I need to provide (source?) 24V, not sink it. \n\nWould buying a couple MOSFETs or a MOSFET array IC be a good alternative? Any recommendations?\n\nedit: Out of curiosity. I see that this chip is \"open collector\" which means the BJT collector is exposed and acts as a switch between ground and an open circuit. I can't really find much on what I'd imagine to be the counterpart, \"open emitter\". Is this also a configuration? i.e. a switch between Vsupply and open circuit?",

Might need a DAC, will try. The idea is to build a sequencer, not really a synth. I just want to have a built in oscillator in order to have an idea of the sequencer output without having it plugged to a synth, no problem if it has a shitty sound.\n\nThe sequencer will have 4 rotary parameters, all potentiometers connected to 5V and to analog input of the arduino.\n\n\"Octave min\" an \"octave max\" set the total number of note allowed\n\n\"Intervalle\" will set the allowed intervals between the note\n\n\"Groove\" Will add some randomness to the intervals (from the code)\n\n\"Tempo\" Will set the tempo (rather obvious)\n\n\"Pattern\" Will set a pattern from a library\n\nIt has also 14 switch controls, 12 allowing me to choose which note are allowed (so I will be able to choose a scale) and 2 sequencer controls.\n\nThere is 2 mode : \"Midi out\" or \"Analog output\" (Double switch in the circuit)\n\n\"Midi output\" : makes the arduino convert the pattern into MIDI.\n\n\"Analog output\" : The arduino (or the DAC controlled by the arduino) generate an analog output, which is sent to a 555 chip (or a VCO). The frequency of the 555 chip is a function of its voltage input. The arduino analog output is controlled in order to deliver voltage corresponding to precise note in the 555 output. In order to chop this in a sequence (according to the sequencer parameters), the analog output is choped by the PWM or the arduino, routed to the gate of a NPN transistor. The 555 output is routed to an amplifier and then to either a jack connector or a speaker.\n\nI also added decoupling capacitors to each power line (will probably make only one 12V and a LM317 circuit). Dunno if I need more ?\n\n[/EDIT]\nHello,\n\nI've been thinking about a crafting a cheap square oscillator with a built in sequencer. The sequencer would be a 16 bits microcontroller (like an arduino, which are 8 bits though) which control a VCO via one of its analog output, gated by the output of its PWM output with a transistor. Could be either a VCO as shown in the scheme below or a 555 chip osc, dunno which is the best. The VCO/555 output is amplied and then routed to a jack output and a speaker.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/mkDMkc\n\nhttps://ibb.co/mkDMkc\n\nThen I would code the arduino in order to deliver voltage output corresponding to precise notes on the VCO/555, this signal is choped by the PWM output that I would program to play beats. These beats would be either saved presets or randomly generated (analogically or digitally). The 12 switches connected to the digital input of the microcontroller would allow me to choose which notes of the scale are played. I would add a potentiometer connected to an analogic input of the microcontroller to choose in which octaven range the notes are played.\n\nI'm not really experienced with electronic, I hope this circuit design is not too naive.\n\nWould it work ? If it would'nt, could you explain me why ?",

Since the input voltage is constantly increasing with t (and the output closely following with a small lag) then I don't understand how to relate the output to some time constant. Duding the lecture I seem to have jotted down some formula tau = Vin(t) - Vout(t)  .. but this doesn't make sense since the resulting value is in Volts and on top of it the value I get is a little too low.\n\nNow if I select a particular voltage and measure the time lag between the input and output I get approximately what I need - could it be that simple?

We were to use Manchester encoding. \n\nThinking through the lab, I was planning to do the following:\n1. convert string to binary\n2. pad string to 160x length. (48000 sample rate/ 300 bit rate)\n3. convert to manchester\n4. pad the preamble and concat.\n5. transmit\n6. recieve\n7. correlate received signal with the preamble to align my signal\n8. remove the preamble\n9. shrink the signal back to starting size\n10. decode from Manchester\n11. convert to text\n\nMy issues came in around #7. I simply do not understand how we can figure out how many samples the signal starts after the preamble through the correlation. After this, I don't understand how to 'un-Manchester'. \n\nAs you can tell, I'm very new to this. I think part of the problem may be that I am asking the wrong questions, but I don't know what I should be asking. Any help would be much appreciated.",

What would be the best way to use terminate this signal without just setting the generator output to high impedance setting?\n\n2) How do the designers insert the 50ohm output impedance? Assuming they use some transistor output, the output impedance should be fairly low(perhaps?). Do they add specific components like say a &lt;50ohm resistor and matching components? ",

        "text": "I'm currently working on a project that involves some electrical isolation. I have access to both of the standards in the title, but am primarily using IEC 62368. In my understanding it is very similar to IEC 60950.\n\nMy question relates to how functional insulation affects the outcome of single fault condition tests. Say I have a user accessible conductive part, which is connected to a chain components with functional insulation, terminating in a high voltage/current net. In the case of the diagram linked below, a DC-DC converter, and a MOSFET. A single fault condition, as mandated by IEC 62368 - Annex B.4, anywhere along the chain of parts won’t lead to the user accessible conductive part raising above SELV/ES2 limits due to the functional insulation in either the MOSFET or the DC-DC, which is the requirement for SELV/ES1 (IEC 62368 - 4.2.1). However the standard demands that there be a single layer of reinforced insulation, or a combined basic and supplementary level of insulation (IEC 62368 - 4.3.2.4). How is this tested if the diagram below is supposedly single fault tolerant? Where am I going wrong?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/OxH6Y\n\nIn the medical standard EN 60601 I believe this is handled by stating that a normal condition can include any or all functional insulation becoming shorted (EN 60601 8.1 a)), and then an additional single fault condition applying to a safeguard. However I don’t think this is the case in IEC 62368 / 60950. \n\nEDIT: A second question is regarding working voltages. Say the DC-DC converter is now reinforced insulation. The DC-DC converter, under normal operating conditions, will only ever be exposed to 5V, as it is protected by the functional isolation in the MOSFET. Under single fault conditions where the MOSFET shorts, that goes up to 100V. Does the working voltage of the DC-DC converter have to be 5V or 100V? Does that depend on whether the fault is detectable and the supply can be shut down before the insulation is degraded?\n\n\n",

The best option I found was device which was reading RFID, NFC, ID, and bank cards. \nCan you guys help me, and point to articles, which would give me detailed explanation on what exactly each one of these terms mean, how they work and so on. I could easily post here how will be used, but I’d rather know how it works so I know what I’m buying. Then I’m also curious about the technology I mentioned. \nYou can share what software you’d use for reading/writing pass cards/tokens etc. I think it’s always better to do some research instead of buying because someone says it’s good.

        "text": "Ok I know that a DRAM bit cell is basically a MOSFET with a capacitor at the drain (or source?). A simple concept. I understand that some of the lack of speed comes from the fact that you have to wait for the capacitor to charge/discharge. So now when we come to SRAM, which is used for cache memory, I know that they are built from cross coupled inverters. This ends up taking 6 MOSFETs. Then for registers, I believe that they are D flip Flops, which I believe would be in the Parallel In-Parallel Out configuration to make them work as fast as possible. Now what exactly makes this technology faster? I'm guessing this is more on the EE-side of things, since we're talking about the transistors themselves. Why are so many transistors connected together a faster technology for memory (at the moment) than just one transistor with a capacitor?",

Maybe a lamp? The professor told us the project must be mostly hardware than software, so coding/programming shouldn't be a big part of our project. Since the class is split into 2 semesters (Preparation and actually making the project) I have until the end of this year- December 2018 to be done with it. Any ideas?\nEDIT: This is a one person project so yes it is pure EE stuff. Also the lamp thing was just a random thought, I don't mind doing other stuff.  ",

Not gonna go into specifics here, but task control blocks within FreeRTOS were being corrupted, and it took weeks to figure out the culprit. In response, our company invested in a J-Trace to use instruction tracing, in case we run into another hard to fix bug. \n\nI was wondering if anyone on this sub has experience configuring a microcontroller for Embedded Trace Macrocell tracing? In this case, it's a Microchip SAME5x chip. I've verified that the pins that output trace data have been muxed correctly, but there's no information in the datasheet for the part that aids in setting up any clocking (should that be necessary)",

Or maybe I am just not picking up the terminologies they're using. \n\nI am thinking of using [NodeMCU ESP8266](http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html) but looks like it IO pins are 3.3V tolerant. I did look up projects that use arduino with L298 and they have directly connected the digital IO pins from an arduino to EN/IN pins of H-bridge. From this, I infer they are 5V tolerant but if that's the actual case, I would have to step up 3.3V coming from an IO pin of NodeMCU to 5V before it connects to the EN/IN pin?\n\nAppreciate your time\n\n[This](https://tttapa.github.io/ESP8266/Chap04%20-%20Microcontroller.html) is another good link for ESP8266",

Is it possible to switch careers after a year or two in one field if I hate it or do you pretty much get pigeon holed?\n\nI've got an instrumentation engineering tech diploma (although never worked in the field) so I've got a rough idea of what the tech side looks like but not the engineering side. Is it similar to embedded systems in the sense that the coding is different (C/C++ vs ladder/vendor specific language) and the pieces you're putting together are much bigger (uC/IC's vs PLC's/motors/valves)?\n\nAdditionally, what might a Control Systems Engineer do in a regular work day?\n\nAny perspective from people working in those fields would be great!",
