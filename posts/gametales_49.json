        "text": "**Note:** This is a continuation of my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/205rnk/pathfinder_ce_party_in_offtherails_serpents_skull/).\n\nThe wizard worked with speed, filtering a liquid through a scroll, gently shaking a boiling flask here, jotting down notes there. Fully preoccupied with his work, he hadn't even indicated he recognized I was standing just behind him, watching him work.\n\nHe had not rested. The moment orders were given, the wizard set himself to the task. This would go on this way for years, should I let it. Day after day of watching this man craft tools we would never need.\n\nAgnhazan had already provided us with all we needed. Khul was blessed with a powerful rage and strength. Boom was cleverly underfoot and skilled with his pistols. Our King Zaius, leader of Agnhazan's people the Charau-ka, was also a mighty warrior that channeled Agnhazan's blessing through himself. And Rhowl, a strangely blessed creature that could channel Agnhazan's power at will. And myself, capable of killing with my bare hands, thanks to my own brillance. There was nothing else we needed to finish what Agnhazan had required of us.\n\n\n\nNo, we did not need what this wizard crafted. \"This was another trick of the Raksasha\", Bharatum realized, \"and only I can see that.\"\n\nBharatum studied the wizard, deciphering where his weakest point was, how he could kill him with a single strike. Then he lashed out. As he did so, the wizard raised a flask to the light to peer through it, by chance putting bharatum into his peripheral vision. Instantly his alarm set off a protective spell, creating numerous illusiory duplicates.\n\n\n\n\"What is this‽\" he exclaimed, taking a step back and casting another protective spell, causing him to flicker faintly in and out of existence. Focused on ending this quickly, Bharatum closed his eyes and tapped into stored spell energy that guided him directly to his target. He lept, kicking out at the wizard, honing in directly but feeling only cool, faintly viscious air as the wizard blinked into the astral plane at just that moment. Landing, Bharatum immediately grasped for the throat and again only came up with a handful of air.\n\n\"FOOL!\" Bellowed Khul, \"cease this at once!\"\n\nBharatum glanced over at Khul and shouted \"The Raksasha fools you! Anghazan guides me!\"\n\n\n\nTaking advantage of the distraction, the wizard fled backwards into the corner of the room and blocked the path to him with a magical pit. Bharatum and Zaius both were threatened with falling into the pit, but Bharatum lept onto the laboratory table while Zaius stepped toward the wizard and attempted to cut him down. Instead, only finding air as one of the illusionary doubles disappeared.\n\nGnomes now began to panic, and fled into one mysterious side doors nearest the wizard.\n\nEyes open now and with a snaral, Bharatum charged over the table and pounced onto the wizard, landing only on the ground as another illusionary double disappeared.\n\nClambaring, almost stumbling, and letting another illusionary image take a blow, the wizard pressed himself along the wall, past Bharatum, and rushed into the side door. He turned and cast another spell. Zaius followed closely on his heels, but fell back at the door, an invisible wall blocking his passage.\n\n\n\nBharatum and Zaius could only watch as the wizard passed out of view, closing another door behind him.\n\n\"Go there as soon as you can, my king\" said Bharatum, gesturing in the direction the wizard fled, \"and I will search for him through the other two routes.\"\n\nThe laboratory had three doors on three separate walls. Somehow they were magically linked together through a series of tiny 5'x5' rooms. Each room had exactly two doors, one opposite of the other. Entering one side door and then closing it behind you, you could pass from room to room and eventually come out one of the other doors in the laboratory. Previous experimentation demonstrated that there was no regular linkage between the rooms, indeed one could find oneself back in the laboratory after just a half dozen rooms or after many dozens. Any writing would disappear after a short time, and broken doors would reform once out of sight.\n\n\n\nBharatum believed the wizard was hiding in one of the rooms somewhere, hoping to stay hidden. Bharatum wanted to find the wizard while he was on the run and not fully prepared for a battle. He began his search methodically, standing at the center of the laboratory and opening one door at a time. Then he would move one of the lab's many books to act as a door stop and hold the door open. Then he would open another door of the path on the adjacent wall. Using this method, he opened a dozen doors down each path. Zaius sood at the third door, continually testing the invisible wall, waiting for it to dissipate.\n\nThen suddenly, the few remaining gnomes rushed into the open corridors, kicked the books out of the way and slammed the doors shut. Rushing after them, Bharatum opened the door to find only an empty room.\n\n\n\nHours passed while Bharatum searched the magical rooms, attempting to decipher their puzzle. Khul mocked him continuously while banging out a chaotic rhythm on his drums. Eventually exhausted, Bharatum gave up the search and rested for the night.\n\nAs the group rested, an awful cacophony of music sounded, seemingly from nowhere. After a moment the sound died out and the alerted party returned to their rest. Not an hour later the cacophony sounded again. And again. Every hour for the next day.\n\nThe wizard watches us and keeps us from resting, thought Bharatum. Scrying? No, for surely one of them would have noticed the signs of scrying at some point. The wizard must see us somehow, but how? Exhausted, Bharatum gave up the thought and tried to rest.\n\nSurprisingly, the next 24 hours remaind quiet and restful. \n\n\n\nAfter resting, Bharatum began to search through the laboratory. He pulled down every book and scanned it for anything that might help him to find out where the wizard had gone or how the doors worked. Journals, notes in the margins, anything written by the wizard.\n\n\"Fool, you waste our time\" berated Khul, \"we could have magical items but now we spend days doing nothing!\"\n\n\"We wouldn't be wasting our time if you had attacked the killed the wizard instead of being blinded by his promise of trinkets!\"\n\n\"He was to make powerful magic for Khul! For all of us, but you attacked him.\"\n\n\"Yes! This place is a trap. He is the trap! Our army waits for us. The Raksasha probably destroys our army right now and steals our six spheres.\"\n\n\n\nWithout the spheres, they would have no hope of activating the seven spires of the city as Anghazan had commanded them. The Raksasha had the seventh sphere - the whole reason for invading his fortress and getting trapped here. With the seven spheres the Raksasha could unleash the power of the spires and no one knew what would happen then.\n\n\"Without the spheres and without the army we fail Anghazan.\"\n\n\"With the items the wizard crafts we can take the speres back and wouldn't need the army!\"\n\nBharatum then slowly snarled his reply \"You only need those items because you are weak. Anghazan would never grace one weak like you.\"\n\n\n\nImmediately raged at the remark, Khul charged and brought his sword down on Bharatum. With a crunch, the blade bit deep into his shoulder and the hot, wet feel of blood spread over his chest and back. Khul yanked the blade out with a scraping sound as bone slid along the blade. As he did so, his eyes widened and he looked down at his shoulder - blood poured from it the same as from Bharatum's wound. Anghazan had forbid them from striking each other, and this was Khul's punishment for breaking that commandment.\n\nUndaunted by the attack, Bharatum spun about and brought his fist to bear against Khul's side. Bharatum felt the bash in his own side too, but he continued and cursed at Khul, filling his mind with a dark magical joke that sent the ape into an uncontrolled laughter. Khul dropped his blade and fell to the ground. Likewise, the curse spilled over into Bharatum's mind and he found himself in the same state.\n\n\n\nFor half a minute the two lay there, convulsing with laughter, smearing blood around the floor. When the laughter finally died down, Khul drew himself up onto his feet while Bharatum lay there.\n\nBefore Khul could strike Bharatum rolled over and slammed a fist down onto Khul's foot. Again he channeled the dark magic into Khul's mind, but Bharatum was ready for the black lash and steeled his mind against it. Khul went down on one knee, laughing, and then tipped over sideways onto the floor. Bharatum laughed, but this time only at Khul's failure and his success.\n\nBharatum cheerfuly stood, walked over to one of the laboratory's tables, and sat atop it. For several long minutes Bharatum continued to laugh at Khul, driving the ape into more and more uncontrolled laughter. The giant ape was fully under Bharatum's control, but how could he kill him? Whatever damage he did to the ape would also be done to himself - and surely the ape had the constitution to survive more damage than Bharatum.\n\n\n\nBharatum realized that the two would have to come to terms. He had proven his dominance, now Khul would have to relent.\n\n\"Ha ha, Khul look at you! You have been beaten. Ah, ha ha, give this up ape and I will release you from my spell.\"\n\n\"I hahahah will hahaha khilll ahahahah you ahhahahha!\" Khul blurted through the laughing fits.\n\n\"HA! I can hold you in this spell until you starve to death, or at least are so fatigued as to be of no threat to me. What say you, give this up and help me find a way out of here?\"\n\nKhul seemed to reflect on this for a while, and then spoke \"Fine!\" With that, Bharatum released Khul from his spell and readied himself for the immediate betrayal.\n\nKhul rose to his feet, grabbed his blad and charged. Ready for this, Bharatum began to kick out at the ape. Then they both froze, locked in place. Anghazan had asserted his will over the two combantants like a parent fed up with the bickering of children.\n\n\n\nSilently, Bharatum thanked Anghazan, for he knew his curse would not work again against the ape a third time that same day.\n\nVocally, Khul promised that there would be a reckoning.\n\nFastly held in place, the internal struggle was put to rest for the time being. The rest of the group began to interrogate the one gnome that they had captured. This now being the second day of regular interrogation, the gnome proved much more helpful than he had before. He pointed out a small pinhole in the ceiling. Through that hole was another room where the wizard could be spying on them from. He also revealed that the wizard as well as the gnomes would regularly travel to another pocket dimension. Much like the magical laboratory, that dimension was limited in size and existed only of their living quarters - a place for them to rest when not working in the laboratory.\n\n\"We can get up there,\" said Bharatum, still frozen in place. \"I have a potion of gaseous form.\"\n\n\n\n\"Give me the potion so I can search the room\" commanded Khul.\n\n\"Only if you end this thing between us.\" Obviously Khull was still feeling scathed from his recent subjectation and needed to prove himself to the group. Little did Khull realize the delicate position he was in and that whatever answer he gave, he would still be revealing his place in subordance to Bharatum while the rest of the group watched.\n\n\"Fine. Just give me the potion.\" Bharatum could almost hear a \"please\".\n\nInstantly the paralyzing grip of Anghazan was released and Bharatum was able to fish out the potion while Khul waited on him. As he should.\n\n\n\nA short investigation later, the room was found to be bare and only 5x5. More importantly, the room was not subject to the spell that hung in the air throughout the laboratory, blocking plane shifting and teleportation. After some debate about a course of action, Khul complied with Bharatum's direction and cut out the floor from the room, making it such that anyone to teleport into the room would fall onto the floor of the laboratory.\n\nSome hours later a gnome appeared and came crashing down onto the lab floor. The group quickly captured the gnome and recovered a tuning fork, the magical component necessary to teleport to the wizard's living quarters. Space was then cut out from the walls of the small room above the lab, giving place for everyone to stand when teleporting.\n\nRemmy, the bodyguard of King Zaius, prepared a plane shift spell, and the following day we prepared for battle and teleported to the wizard's living quarters.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I lurk here sometimes and I love the hilarious stories you guys have to share. My group is still pretty fresh to DnD, frankly, we have no idea what we're doing. We have no one to \"show us the ropes\", per say, just my mom's old second generations books. We usually wing it.\n\nOur mage, previously our well-meaning but totally oblivious thief (who now has a cult following in our world) has a problem. All he really wanted was to be a blood mage. Since we were too lazy to look up ideas online, we just kind of made that up as we go along. All his spells are powered by fresh blood--usually that means I have to kill something for him first, but sometimes he just cuts himself open and goes at it, which usually leads to him almost dying before we can patch him up. Basically anything to do with blood and he gets crazy. Once I was leading him through a solo dungeon, through the catacombs of the church of Zaar (yes, that's the theif). He was *supposed* to be looking for the secret of DumblZore's power. (Yes, DumbleZore. I am not a creative person.) \n\nSpinaltap creeps down the slick stairs to the catacombs, not bothering to look around for any obvious traps. By pure luck, he slips and tumbles, missing the razorwire poised to take off his head. Obvious, he stands back up and walks through the intricate steel doors, not reading the ominous portent inscribed on them with blood. \n\nHe find himself in a Cathedral of Death, with boiling pools of a coppery substance on either side, zinging with power and calling to him. He ignores them, walking straight toward the silk-draped shrine in the center. On it lies a carved figurine of a cloaked man, a thick book with strange glyphs all over it's cover, and a rusty ritualistic dagger.\n\nSpinaltap grabs the dagger and slits both his wrists.\n\n*What the hell, man?!*\n\nSpinaltap continues to cut himself. *What?*\n\n*It's a rusty knife, you don't know where that's been, there aren't even any enemies around! What are you trying to accomplish?*\n\nSpinaltap slices himself even deeper, growing faint from the blood loss. *I'm a BLOOD MAGE. You left me a rusty dagger on a fancy table. THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO!*\n\nThis is where our usual DM, laughing his butt off, chimed in. *Spinaltap has contracted a rare flesh eating bacteria, which will eat away at his limbs until he can reach a healer.*\n\nThe whole room goes totally silent in shock. Spinaltap just stares at our DM. This guy, in reality, lost most of him limbs when he was a kid to... can you guess it?\n\nSuddenly he's just rolling on the floor, laughing. He then went on to fight the highlord DumbleZore, although he didn't win the battle (DumbleZore was way too powerful for him to take on alone) he *did* manage to steal a necklace made from an evil dragons eye. The dragon now speaks to him in his mind, encouraging to kill small animals and children, and, of course, cut himself.\n\nI hate blood mages.",

        "text": "I run a Dungeon World game over google hangouts with some of my siblings. Yesterday things got a bit out of hand, in a good way.\n\nThe party, a paladin, ranger, druid, cleric, and bard entered a jungle tree-village under attack by giant poison frog creatures. They dispatch the first frog they see and decide to press on into the village to save the villagers when several frogs flank them from behind.\n\nIn Dungeon World, druids can shapeshift quite easily, so my druid (who hails from the Sapphire Islands) decides to transform into an octopus and attach himself to the cleric. He then begins spitting gobs of ink into the eyes of the frog attackers. He actually manages to nail 2 of them before he starts suffocating (he seems to have forgotten that he's a water breather.) He quickly uses some elemental mastery to surround himself with a bubble of water, and the cleric hurls him at the last frog, who is now almost upon them.\n\nThe cleric hits the frog square in the face with the magical water bubble, which envelops him as well. The octopus wraps himself around the frog creature's face and finishes him off, but takes some poison damage from the frog's skin.\n\nAt this point, the shapeshift spell wears off and the druid returns to human form. However, he has lost control of the water spell, and now he's stuck inside the water bubble with a dead frog creature. The paladin charges over and manages to yank the druid out of the water before he drowns.\n\nMost of the village is now on fire. The party decides to get behind the water bubble and start pushing it around the village putting out fires and running over frogs that get in their way. Before long there are two frogs in the bubble (which is slowly becoming more poisonous) and the rest of the frog creatures are terrified and are scrambling out of the way.\n\nOne of the frogs grabs a villagers from a tree house and is about to make off with him when the paladin comes up with a plan. He grabs the cleric and heaves him at the waterbubble, hoping to use it as a trampoline and launch the cleric to the upper levels of the village. \n\nHe somehow pulls this off, except that the cleric hits the bubble at the wrong and angle and flies off to the right into the jungle canopy. The cleric grabs a vine, but a frog begins climbing down it towards him. Thinking quickly, the cleric casts Cause Fear between the frog and the vine, and the frog leaps away from it in terror. However, the vine snaps and the cleric finds himself plummeting towards the ground.\n\nThe druid tries to save him by summoning a cushion of air under him to break his fall, but the spell goes completely haywire and creates a hurricane blast that sweeps through the village. The rest of the villagers and frogs are swept from their houses and plummet to the ground, the cleric gets knocked sideways into a tree, and the flames flair into an inferno.\n\nThe ranger makes her bear companion leap underneath one of the falling villagers, who lands unharmed on its belly. The party regroups as the rest of the frogs flee and the village burns to the ground.",

I've got beer and a few minutes to spare. The team is defending a suburban villa against Aztechnology assault runners. Where we left off last time, they'd just survived the first night.\n\n**Dramatis Personae** \n\n**Bobtail** - The glue-obsessed trucker troll rigger, and backbone of the team\n\n**Jaeger** - The human ex-merc street sam, when he's conscious.\n\n**Sheriff** - The human biker adept, and perhaps the most sensible of the bunch.\n\n**Spike** - The Japanese elven former-Yak Decker, and supposed Face, who really should be a Mage with a specialization and spell focus for Acid Wave.\n\n----\n\n**2074, November 27, Tuesday**\n\n**9:10 -** Since the house took a beating from the SWAT ninjas of last night and the team want the extra 50k ¥ for \"leaving no traces\", the team goes off shopping for basic repair materials. They cover the broken windows with plywood, get some paint and plaster for the bullet holes in the walls. While they're at it, Bobtail is messaged by his fixer, Mr. Nixon, who has a quick and lucrative job offer. The rigger pops down to Nixon's strip club, The Oral Office, to hash out the details in case it's something that they can do while still handling their current job.\n\nIt goes something like \"There's a group of runners holed up in a villa in Renton, protecting a decker. Representatives of a certain Megacorp have offered 80k for the head of said decker. Interested?\" \"Uuh, no. Could you hold off on asking anyone else?\"\n\n**11:08 -** While the team is in the middle of their repairs, they are visited by perhaps their most fearsome foe yet: Patricia Bodieaux, the chairman of the Homeowner's Association. Apparently the state of the house, with broken windows and wreckage all over, violates at least three HOA regulations, and makes them subject to heavy fines unless they immediately screen the villa from the road. The HOA handbook has a list of certified companies.\n\n**12:55 -** The doorbell rings yet again. The UCAS girl scouts are selling cookies. Though Spike wants to pour acid on them from aboce, the team buys several boxes, then return to their repairs, also making sure to glue shut the rear patio door.\n\n**14:12 -** The doorbell rings yet again. The NAN boy scouts are selling (real) beef jerky, at 100 ¥ for 50g. Bobtail, who detests native americans, wants to classify them as hostiles. The others hold him back, and Spike even picks up a bag of jerky, after being talked out of another acid bath.\n\n**16:32 -** They are confronted yet again by Patricia Bodieaux, who threatens to call Knight Errant on them unless they have the screen up by nightfall. Unwilling to call official notice on them (which is also why they stop Spike from grumbling about acid again), Bobtail gives in and calls the only listed certified screening company, Bodieaux Construction. The screen will run them 5k ¥ per day, but they have little choice (unless their Face decided to actually do some Face:ing).\n\nThe team eats dinner, and half retire to rest during an uneventful evening.\n\n----\n\n**2074, November 28, Wednesday**\n\n**00:15 -** Spike is doing rounds on the ground floor when he notices a flickering light and the smell of smoke from the living room. Rushing in, he finds a good quarter of the room on fire. A quite malevolent and clearly *intelligent* fire. Moments later a similarly powerful water spirit materializes in the sitting room across the hall.\n\nJaeger attacks the fire spirit with one of their strategically placed fire extinguishers, while dodging the tongues of flame shooting out from the burning corner. Sheriff takes on the water spirit head on with regular guns. Since fire extinguishers are considered apex predators on the plane of fire, and stick n' shock ammo works terrifyingly well against spirits, the fight is kept small. The same cannot be said for the collateral damage: a permeating smell of smoke has joined the lingering odour of smoke grenades and poison gas, the living room is charred worse than Spike's cooking, and the entire ground floor is covered in half an inch of water.\n\nBobtail calls up Liandra, the mage contact who put up the astral barrier on the house, but is informed that no defence is perfect. A sufficiently powerful spirit *can* make it through undetected.\n\n**00:20 -** Concerned that there may be more spirits lurking nearby, Sheriff takes a look outside in the astral plane. Only his quite supernatural reflexes allow him to dodge the sniper bullet. He dodges another bullet before diving back in the house, but is unable to pinpoint the attacker's location. Carefully making his way to a window, he tries to spot it from there.\n\nJaeger has a similar idea, but moves upstairs to the windows on the second floor. With cybereyes with a multitude of vision enhancements he manages to spot the enemy: a rotodrone hovering well out of reach of their regular small arms. Unfortunately, the drone notices Jaeger as well, and puts a bullet square through the street sam who is knocked unconscious and bleeding out.\n\nSpike for once forgoes acid as the first option, and logs onto the Matrix. With guidance from his meatspace team, he quickly tracks down the drone and sets to work. It's a simple task for him to mark the drone, gaining him a mark on the enemy rigger's Rigger Command Console as well. Switching his target to this instead, he swiftly gains a second mark and traces its physical location to a street corner a few blocks away. Then he blasts it with so much malicious code that it shorts and catches fire.\n\nSheriff, appraised of the van's location, sets off parkour style through the neighbourhood. Spike turns back to the drone and hacks it for another couple of marks. With three of them, he can order it down to the garden where Bobtail deactivates it. Meanwhile, Sheriff reaches the van in time to see it drive off. Bobtail puts a drone on tracking it for a while, but when it seems clear it's not coming back, he relents. Spike could probably hack it and cause some havoc, but at this point he's somewhat concerned with his Overwatch score, that's been building for quite a while. He's unaware just how a wise move this is, as the OS has reached 39.^1\n\n**03:46 -** As the night continues uneventfully from there on, only Spike is on watch. Nobody has slept long enough to recover a single Edge since the start of the run, and Bobtail and Sheriff aren't about to give up their scheduled sleeping hours even if Jaeger is hooked up to the medkit and still useless. Therefore they're unaware of the infiltrator in high tech stealth gear who cuts open the window in the second story bathroom, sneaks past the drones on guard, and ambushes Spike.\n\nSpike, never very good with weapons, is clearly the underdog in the fight, and it's all he can do to call out a warning to the others before the enemy has put enough rubber bullets in him to knock him unconscious. Nevertheless, the enemy is now quite outnumbered and opts for the better part of valour, breaking another window in the process.\n\n**07:03 -** The team receives another message from Mr. Johnson, congratulating them on yet another day completed.\n\n**08:30 -** The team has given up on the \"leave no trace\", as the the villa is now more of a war zone than a domicile. But wishing at least to be able to keep up the facade at the door, Bobtail goes off to buy replacement carpeting for the hallway, and rent a couple of dehumidifiers.\n\n**10:05 -** A Knight Errant patrol car rolls up and a pair of officers ring the doorbell. There have been enough reports of suspicious activities to warrant a visit, though they're hardly dedicated to the task. The team does their best to pose as incompetent security/construction workers - their planned cover story - and while their excuses are pretty weak, they're enough to drive off the officers. Not before they have noted down the names of all their fake SINs, though.\n\nBobtail and Spike spend the rest of the day tampering with the Rotodrone to change its owner to Bobtail.\n\n**17:13 -** Similar to the first day, two fellows with the coveralls of Seattle East Power technicians show up for inspection. Doubly wary, Bobtail makes sure to scan them for cyberware and weapons, but can find little. They are, in fact, actual techs. All they want is to perform a routine inspection of the power installation under the stairs. They do look rather curiously at the hole Spike has drilled in the stairs for his sniper nest, and the 50 litres of bleach stacked there.\n\n**Running into the character limit here. The rest will be posted in comments!**\n\n*^1 For those unfamiliar with the game: An Overwatch score rises as you do illegal stuff on the Matrix, like hacking. If it reaches 40, you get to meet the Grid Overwatch Division (GOD), who will eat your soul and report your location to the local authorities.*",

        "text": "Context: Me and a group of friends (I was the DM) were playing a game (homebrew) in a sequel to the previous game, set several years in the future, at the cusp of this world'a industrial revolution.  One thing to note about this world, was that the majority of the civilization that the PC's were exposed to was all in one large city, and was particularly isolationist.  Another important detail is that the magic of this world is drawn from a special crystal, which the people also learned to use in machines.  Apart from that, the crystals are volatile, exploding with a hard enough impact.  So throughout this adventure this character, we'll call him Red, had been part of a group of Shadow Priests, who lived in exile from The City, due the Engineers there hating magic users. These priests sought to over throw the Paragon (the ruling aristocracy of the engineers) and take back what they believed to be theirs.  These priests had In their possession a powerful Artifact, a large corrupted Mana crystalline object that the Priests drew power from. Red managed to convince the priests to let him take the artifact, and came Into possession of a synthetic artifact (artifact denoting a powerful source of magic) created by the engineers, which being raw crystal, was not corrupted like the one the priests had. Sooner or later, Red gets the idea to, well, bash the two together. This causes a massive explosion, incinerating Red, and leading to a serious of disasters that basically shut down society, with the only survivors being forced into the wilds, soon forgetting the ways of machines and science.  So, in short, Red managed to blow up the entire industrial era.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/205rnk/pathfinder_ce_party_in_offtherails_serpents_skull/",
        "text": "Previously on \"Serpent's Skull\"...\nThe party is trapped inside a ziggurat, home of a rakasha that has the last one of 7 magical spheres we are collecting. Outside, we have gathered an army of Charau-ka and are preparing to wage war on the rest of the Mwangi Expanse. That army is protecting the 6 spheres we have recovered thus far.\n\nThe party is level 10 and consists of Kull - a gorilla alchemist that is appointed leader by our god Agnhazan. Myself, a charau-ka hexcrafter assassin. Boom, a goblin ninja gun slinger. Zaius, Charau-ka inquisitor that is also the king of the Charau-ka tribe/army we control. Rummy, high level human cleric NPC appointed by Agnhazan to protect Zaius (but he worships some other god and has some hidden agenda). And last, but not least, Rhowl the nature oracle.\n\n\n\nBharautum watched the group laugh and giggle as they shoved the shadow into the portable hole. Tired of all these noisy lemurs getting in his way, he decided to head off down the hall and see what there was and hopefully to get the jump on something and kill it before the group comes in and alerts everything.\n\nComing up to the first room, a pair of beheaded bull statues flanked the doorway. Probably some sort of warning to not be bullheaded or something stupid like that. He glanced over his shoulder and saw the group peering down the hallway at him. Better hurry up and have some fun before they get here. Stepping into the room, it was just a wreck - looked like some primitive library filled with clay tablets thrown about the room into heaps and piles. He poked around for just a moment before some of the others arrived and started sifting through the rubble with him.\n\nRhowlis blundering about the room when he finds something squishy - Pudding! That stupid ape walked right into it as he was kicking the tablets around. The goblin fires off several rounds at the thing, having some effect. Bharautum hasn't ever seen a pudding before and all he remembers hearing about them is that these things hate fire, so he blasts at the thing with a scorching ray - OH YEAH IT BURNS! The thing catches fire and begins smoking. Everyone else in the room starts coughing and hacking. Idiots don't know to hold their breaths! They all try backing out of the room as they hack and cough. Pussies. Bharatum rushes up to the thing, charging his fists with freezing cold energy - maybe the liquidy pudding will hurt from being frozen just as much as it hates burning. Smashing it felt good, but the thing was still alive and smoldering. Rhowlkicks hard at it and splatters it - chunks of the thing splash everywhere.\n\nSearching through the room a bit more, I found several metallic plates, each with a relief image of a bull-like creature, much like the statues outside the doorway. I walked back into the hallway and turned to go into the next room with flanking, headless statues about the doorway. The big ape, Kull, had already searched through the place and was holding some potion trying to figure out what it was.\n\nI thought Kull was a decent alchemist, but obviously that was a mistake. \"Give me that!\" I said, with an implied \"you idiot\" only slightly masked in my tone of voice.\n\n\"What? Ask the right way!\"\n\nAre you kidding me? This guy doesn't know a thing, and he wants some sort of please-thank you? \"Give it to me!\" I replied. He refused again and we went back and forth a couple times before he realized who his better was. After a quick taste I realized it wasn't anything important and gave it back.\n\nThey had also found some more metallic plates much like the ones I had found. We examined them and the statues but could not figure out what to do with them just yet. Giving up, I began walking down the hall to the next door when there was a sudden flare of light and the image of the rakasha appeared back down the hallway a bit. I immediately knew this was another waste of time for us, another programmed illusion that will just taunt us for getting trapped in his ziggaurat. I continued on my way to the next door, but everyone else couldn't use their heads and were suddenly all up in arms about this illusion. While they spent their time trying to attack it, I reached the next door and tried opening it, but it was locked.\n\nIt was about then that the illusion started attacking back, dispelling some of the protections we had prepared earlier. Clearly this was a more powerful illusion than I had encountered before. Something like this would require the caster to be near by, perhaps in one of these locked rooms?\n\nKull got his wits about him and realized the same thing and bashed open a nearby door. Half of the party, including myself, went into the room and began searching it. There was a statue on the wall that was asking us some sort of riddle about \"Tell me about the North Wind\". It seemed reasonable that solving this puzzle would either get us closer to the rakasha or at least give us a clue about what was happening. The rakasha illusion took the time to dispell a few more of our protections while we did so. Then, to my surprise, it acted much more offensively and cast a fireball on the party searching through the room!\n\nI avoided any real damage, but now I was sure that the rakasha had to be somewhere very close where he could see us. Our king realized this as well, and ran back down the hallway to the stairs we came down, searching for the real rakasha. After a short period he came back, having found nothing.\n\nI remained in the room, determined to solve the puzzle - especially since the illusionary rakasha seemed highly interested in my search and even seemed to mock me as I mulled over the puzzle. The illusion eventually disappeared, leaving us to search the room.\n\nThe room was full of piles of broken tablets. Most were indecipherable from damage, but those that were still intact had various Aklo passages on them. I quickly was able to recognize the logic hidden behind their prose and came up with the answer to what was the North Wind. But when I gave it, the statue replied \"No.\"!!! Going back over what I had found, it became clear to me that the ancient peoples that created these tablets were hardly literate and were not educated into proper Aklo grammar.\n\nI discussed the logic of the puzzle with the group and our great king was able to see through the puzzle and gave the right answer.\n\nAnother plate appeared. After deciding that there was nothing more of value in this room, we went back into the hallway. A couple others had taken time to explore two other rooms and found a plate as well, giving us 5 in total now. There was only one last door to explore.\n\nWe went into that last door, which had a short corridor and then opened up into another room that housed a portal similar to the one we had nearly been trapped by before. However, this portal had 5 small portals around it. We could see that they had small images of animals, different ones on each little portal. The animals matched the images on the plates we had found. I took one of my plates, climbed up onto the arch of the portal and put the plate into the portal with the matching animal. The portal dissipated, leaving just the stone wall behind it. We quickly did this with the remaining 4 portals, and the main portal flared to life.\n\nI was more than just a little confused. Carefully, I questioned him and tried not to give anything away about who I really was - as long as he thought I was whoever he thought I was he seemed more than willing to be helpful. In fact, he claimed to be able to manufacture any magical item I desired.\n\nOur discussion lasted for a good fifteen minutes, when finally the rest of the party came through the portal. They were supposed to follow me after just two minutes, so I realized that time flowed much quicker here in the magical laboratory.\n\nThe wizard offered to manufacture magical items for my friends too. After gathering up a list, he performed some calculations which took HOURS. His gnome helpers asked us for magic items to use as raw materials to begin the manufacturing process. We handed over lots of the various weapons and armor we had stored away. They started boiling and sawing away at them, drawing the magic out to be used on the new equipment.\n\nAnd then the wizard told us it would take over 700 days to produce what we wanted. Clearly this was too long - our god has set us on a mission and we can't spare that much time. We would have to leave now. We asked the wizard how to leave, and he said he couldn't. After more questioning, we learned that he was a prisoner here and was bound in some way, but he would not tell us how to escape this place - but he knew how. He had been here for thousands of years and served the rakasha as well as many other masters in the past. He believed I was the rakasha and was just pretending to be someone else to fool him.\n\nI began to tell the wizard that I really was not the rakasha, when Kull and Boom stepped up to either side of me and muttered under their breaths that they would not have me reveal who we really were - that if the wizard decided not to make our magic items that they would kill me!\n\nWhat idiots! They would pay for that later...\n\nWe talked with the wizard more and got him to answer the question of how one gets out of this prison. \"Death is the only way\" he replied.\n\nI wasn't sure who's death would be required - anyone? The wizard? A gnome? Our king pulled out a dagger and smashed it through the head of one of the gnomes. \"Is that good enough?\" he said. The wizard shook his head.\n\nSo, someone else would have to die then? Why not Kull or Boom for threatening me?!\n\nI immediately jumped at Kull, intent on taking the advantage of surprise to kill him outright. As I turned, a stray paper slipped under my foot. I began to stumble, attracting the attention of Kull. He casually turned to look at me, and I fell against him like a fool. Luckily no one recognized my intent and thought I just had a moment of clumsiness.\n\nWe dismissed the wizard and let him return to his work making our items. I quietly told my king that I would be happy to slay the wizard when he was distracted. The king agreed that this was a good plan and said he would support me should the wizard have a chance to retaliate.\n\nI casually approached the wizard. I watched him as if I were an apprentice watching a master at work. Then I struck out at him, fully prepared to kill him in that moment. Just as I lurched forward to attack, the wizard had brought up some flask of liquid to examine it in the light. That gave him just enough peripheral vision to realize I was bearing down on him and he reacted, avoiding my blow.\n\n(Attack against Kull: Natural 1. Attack against wizard: Natural 2. This whole assassin thing isn't working out so well for me.)\n\n\n**TLDR**: I can't roll dice.\n\nAlso, I apologize for my atrocious writing.",

        "text": "This legend begins on a cool autumn's night in The Rift.  A storm was starting to brew as a small group of bandits were walking through the woods in search of shelter.  It was a very profitable day for these brigands; they succesfully sacked a Khajitt caravan and shook down a family of poor farmers for protection money.  As a result, they were in high spirits, singing various songs and drinking their mead.\n\nAfter walking for about an hour, the bandits found a small cave in the side of a mountain.  After checking inside for bears and frosbite spiders, the leader ruled that the group should start a fire, cook up some elk meat they hunted, and rest there for the night.  As they were setting up, the storm finally came and it started to rain.\n\nA couple of hours past before most of the group dosed off, drunk off of mead and song.  They planned on making their way to Riften at daylight to sell off their stolen goods to a fence.  One of the lower ranking members volunteered to take first watch.  Even though he wasn't expecting something to happen, he had his sword within reach. \n\nAnother hour had past before the watchman decided to trade shifts with another member when he was suddenly alerted by the crunch of leaves.  He got up and drew his sword.  Was it a frosbite spider?  An elk?  Or maybe a rival band of bandits moving in for an ambush?  Not wanting to take any chances, the bandit made his way out of the cave to look for the source of the noise.\n\nThe rest of the group were later awoken by a scream.  Noticing that their watchman was missing, they drew their weapons and made their way out of the cave.\n\nThey didn't get far before they saw a scene more horrifying than anything they had witnessed before.\n\nAbout fifty paces outside of their cave stood an Orc wearing robes as black as night.  A long scar ran down the side of his face and a long, black blade was strapped to his back. \n\nAnd in his arms was the drained corpse of the watchman.\nThe bandit leader ordered his men to surround the Orc.  As the group circled the intruder, the leader demanded the Orc to put down the watchman and hand over everything he owned, as well as his life, for compensation for killing their comrade.\n\nThe Orc looked up at the leader with eyes as red as the depths of Oblivion.  After taking measure of the amount of men he was surrounded by, which was roughly seven, he dropped the corpse of the watchman and walked towards the bandit leader.\n\nWhen the leader demanded him to stay where he was, the Orc quickly drew his greatsword and, with ungodly speed, rushed the leader and split him in half.  He then turned to the shocked band and bared his fangs.\nThis was no ordinary Orc.  It was a vampire.\n\nThe rest of the bandit group rushed the hell-spawn in an attempt to overwhelm it with multiple blows at once but to no avail.  The creature seamlessly deflected every single blow launched at it with the skill of a master swordsman.  After the shower of blows slowed down, the vampire took the oppotunity to slip under the group while disarming every single one of them.  It also managed to drain the life out of one of the bandits with a destruction spell.\n\nAs the bandits started drawing their second weapons for another rush, the creature let out a long, forlorn howl.  The howl caused the bandits to freeze in their place.\n\nVampire don't howl.  Do they?\n\nThe creature suddenly started to twist and warp.  The sound of bones cracking and expanding could still be heard over the sound of pouring rain.  It grew in size.  Fur started to sprout over its body.  Its hands turned into long, sharp claws.  Its already fanged mouth expanded into a snout.\n\nThe bandits stood by in terror as the vampire tranformed into a giant wolf-like creature with jet black fur.  They couldn't believe what they were witnessing.  What were they fighting, a vampire or a werewolf?\n\nBefore they could come to a conclusion, the beast let out another terrifying howl before tearing into the group with flashing claws and fangs.  Armor was shredded in shard of steel.  Limbs were ripped off of bodies.  The bandit group was being decimated by a monster straight from the deepest reaches of Oblivion.\n\nThe last of the bandits stood by, watching in terror as his comrades were being shredded and devoured.  He was to weak with fear to even lift up his sword.\n\nBefore he knew it, his group was gone and the only ones left were the beast and himself.\n\nHe tried to run but was tackled by the creature.  He looked up at it to get a better look.  Its mouth was dripping with the blood of his brothers-in-arms.  Its eyes had become black pits.  Its lips were curled into a snarl.  What was this creature?  Where did it come from?  Why does it exist?  Will it cause Skyrim to burn and bring all of Tamriel to her knees?\n\nThese were the brigand's last thoughts before being devoured.  ",

        "text": "So my GM and our group just started a campaign today of Black Crusade. The experience thus far had been great as our GM challenges us and we all have fun tormenting things in our path.\n\nSo we start off in a dreadclaw making our way to a renagade carrier that our warlord ordered us to capture. We succeed in landing. However, we get stuck in the underbelly of this ship and our presence is obviously known. After finding a service hatch we narrowly escape death by guardsman using plasma from the plasma ducts to vent in our hallway. We have a service hatch that our two smallest members make way in in order to go to engineering and disable guns and stuff.\n\nSo while this is going on, me, a Khornate Berserker, a heretek, and a renegade are making our way to a service elevator that we wish to use to go up to the command bridge we are ordered to take. \n\nWell, this is a bit of a sticky issue since there is at least 50 to 60 guardsman coming that direction. So we hatch a plan: make a makeshift bomb using lasgun power packs, bolter rounds, and a space marine frag grenade. We make this no problem and we throw it up... and it prematurely detonates, making the elevator unusable. \n\nWell we had a backup that involved using a grapple hook to pull our elevator down. It crashes down and takes the grapple with it. This allows us to use the service ladders that are on the elevator chute, and me and our buddies climb up. The guardsman are distracted by the crashing elevator and go down another route to investigate.\n\nMeanwhile, another renegade and a nurgle chemist/renagade are in the process of sneaking up this chute and our chemist is picking the nastiest bits of ratling shit and fungus from the walls of this service chute. They finally arrive and see four engineseers in the engineering room. They proceed to take out 3 stealthily, but the fourth one was alerted by our chemist tripping on a wrench and uses his servo-arm to kick nurgle chemists ass. They eventually kill this very hardy engineseer and in the process proceed to disable the engineering room with collateral damage. \n\nBack to the Khornate party, we arrive at a corridor that is one deck below our command bridge. The hallway is fortified by a squad of guardsman. My appearance scares the ever loving shit out of a guardsman on an autostubber and I proceed to charge. On this charge however the stubber guardsman momentarily regains aims and gives me three wounds. My comrades pick up the slack I had and proceeded to explode the head of one guardsman and blow the arm off another. The guy on the autostubber is promptly beheaded by my chainaxe and I claim his skull for Khorne. We have a guardsman survive and we interrogate him. Using my ridiculous bonuses to intimidate him, we proceed to find the location of the command bridge. My comrades gather some nice weapons, including las carbines with underslung meltas, and we proceed to the command bridge with the guardsman in tow.\n\nBack in engineering, everyone knows something is up. A massive amount of servitors came to confront our dashing awkward villans, but their programming was screwed by the death of our enginseers and they proceed to attack the floor. The guardsman, finished investigating the crashed elevator, proceed to rush to the engineering room. Before this is to happen, our nurgling chemist proceeds to make a ratling shit fume bomb and set it off there, and them go back into the chute to saftey. This fume bomb clears out most of the bottom of the ship somehow.\n\nBack at command with the Khornate party, we are greeted by a bulkhead to the command room. Me, the heretek, the renegade, and the guardsman I captured and am now holding like a ragdoll are proceeding to breach thus bulkhead. The heretek and renegade melta through the bulkhead.\n\nAs the bulkhead came crashing down I threw the guardsman into the control room like a daggum toy. This guardsman also had 6 primed grenades on his person that I had found on him. The explosion of this human football killed half the resistance in the control room and was replied with a hail of lasfire. A frag grenade is thrown in for distracting them, and my buddies proceed to kill all but one honor guard and the captain. I behead the honor guard and claim his skull for Khorne and then capture the captain. Using the fact that I am at least a full body taller than him he is convinced to tell the ship to stand down. He divulged to us the location of a weapons cache that was on a planet nearby. \n\nAs our warlord came onboard he congratulated us and gave us our next assignment. During this time a wrist mounted meltagun is put on my armor. Our heretek dissects the captain and takes his cybernetics. \n\nAnd for next time, we will be going to a khornate world with noise marines to get a daemon engine!",

[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1zt1j3/dnd_35_the_adventure_of_a_few_people_and_some/) over here.\n\nSo we left of with the party of conventional classes and races as they are instructed to find the missing bride and find out who is behind the super massive blackhole.\n\nThe party had a few trust issues that needed to be resolved. For one, the halfing rogue Basil was only 2 days ago escorted to the dungeon by the dwarf warrior B'hrian. And the elf ranger Marcus had trouble adjusting to be living in a democratic mini society so was found camping in trees and running off into the woods everytime he got the chance.\n\nEventually the group made it to a small village called Hempden, famous for being the birthplace of the archwizard Theoberth. They found themselves amidst a soap-opera situation with a love triangle and the untimely demise of the girl involved. After asking around and piecing it together, no foul play was suspected and they set off hunting the wolves responsible.\n\nThe party nearly died to the small pack of wolves deep in the forest, but eventually could tell the mayor of the village that they were save. For now. This is also were taking the heads of slain foes took off, giving blooddripping gore that was once a head of an animal to disturbed villages. The parents were not amused.\n\nThe party lived off the medaillon given to Raymond (human cleric) for his bravery in the wedding massacre, which gave them free food and sleeping places. They also met a friendly merchant called Jakavi that needed some help escorting his goods to Othlond, the city in the east. Here, the party hoped to find some answers and Jakavi was heading in the same direction.\n\nThey crossed a bridge where a water elemental demanded tollmoney. They hatched the plan that when they were strong enough, they would come back, slay the elemental and take the massive fortune that must have been in these waters.\n\nArriving in Othlond, the party found themselves in a mad bureaucracy that basically demanded papers and a good word for most of the things they wanted, not in the least an answer that would lead them on the way of four keys, which weren't keys after all.",

The server wsa made with the Create A Server tool, and he had a password on so no-one would join. We'd go on different teams, be terrorists/counterterrorists, spam the \"Stick Together\" command, and then kill them all, then do whatever.\n\nThis happened on CS_Militia, we were messing around. We both started killing off our team as per usual, then we went and messed around with the hostages. I got them to the kitchen area, then told them to hold still. After that, to kill a short bit of time before the round would end, we started shooting the bottles, paper towels, pots, et cetera that were on the counter.\n\n20 seconds to go, we take our place by the hostages and both of us pull out a fragmentation grenade. We pull the pin at 3 and release at end of round.\n\nThe grenades don't go off. Next round comes, it says I killed myself with the generic skull-and-crossbones thing, and the next line on the killfeed is a grenade.

        "text": "okay some explanation at this point would be handy, and sorry about the rambling nature of the last post.I was very tired.\nThe cast:\nOscar:Dwarf fighter lawfull good,stick in the mud.( known as Stubborn Dwarf)\nRoywind:Gnome Illusionist good really young and spaztic (Hereafter referred to as Stupid Gnome)\nAnd of course,\nCrush:Bardbarian (with one level of Ogre Paragon at this point) Raging Manwhore, Only Metal Bard in this D&amp;D world.\n\nThis tale takes place one month later game time than the last tale.\nOn Their Quest for the chest-plate to a legendary suit of armor they located it in old cave system from info gathered in the local village called Skurn. The cave system has the predictable name of Skurn Caverns and is reputed to be the haunt of various undead.\n\n\nAs they enter the cave a mysterious fog envelopes the small group and renders them unconscious. They awaken to find them selves tied to stakes with a gloating Vampire eying them with hungry intent.\nCrush panics and starts  struggle and roar in rage giving Stupid Gnome time to cast animate rope and free him and immediately starts to free Stubborn Dwarf with the same spell.\n\n\nRealizing he needs to buy the others time he pulls out a sun stone from a pouch and throws it at the vampire. (Nat 20!Crit confirm! 20 again! Dm is cursing my luck) as the vampire opens his mouth to finish a spell the sun stone goes down his throat and detonated.\n\nThe Vampire starts to shine from within and smoke till it collapsed into a pile of ash.\n\n\nCrush stunned by his great fortune helps free the others from the stakes and has an Idea! Knowing that blood will cause it to return to life he sweeps the vampire dust into a small pouch and then pulls an empty vial out, cuts his finger with a knife and bleeds into the vial.\nHe then wraps the vial in cloth and places it into the pouch of vampire dust.\n\n(Me out of game: Look a Vampire Bomb! DM: What have you done now? How would this \"item\" work? Me:Well if we burst into a room and there is something super nasty inside I'll just throw the bomb in and close the door.The Vampire Pissed off from being killed and being faced with a threat should naturally attack the threat. then we can just throw sunstones or cast sunlight into the room and reset my \"Bomb\" good sir. he later ruled that every time i use it he does an attitude roll for the vamp to see what it does 1. Attacks the threat 2. escapes to safety/freedom 3. turns on us and attacks.) \n\n\nAmongst the Vampires possessions is a black hole that Crush falls in love with and literally paid the other party members to let him have it.(he's held a\"concert here he basically charmed the whole audience into pillaging the town and over throwing the local government. During said chaos he robbed a jewelers and is now rich.Oscar the stubborn dwarf is infuriated with him as well over it.) \n\n\nThey continue to explore the caves and after a clever usage of the open/close spell to trigger a mundane ceiling drop trap by the Stupid Gnome which earns Crushes respect because she saved his life he starts calling her Silly Gnome instead. They discover that the black hole makes dungeoneering much easier and discover what can only be their goal.\n\n\nThe door before them is huge and made of some kind of exotic wood.\nCrush: \"Hmph, we're there.\"\nStubborn Dwarf: \"How do you know?\"\nCrush: \"Look at door dwarf,It much better stuff than other doors we see down here.By logic it be goal.\"\nStubborn Dwarf: *Eying Crush with a small amount of respect* \"You may be right for once.\"\nCrush: \"Crush always right Stupid Dwarf! Stop Judging Crush! Crush plenty smart! Crush show you!\"\n\n\nHe then slaps the black hole on the wall next to the door and throws the vampire bomb thru it. He then pulls the hole off the wall. There was a scream of rage followed by a bellowing roar the sounds of a mighty struggle ensues and then stops.Just to be safe Crush slaps the hole back up and tosses a handful of sunstones thru,The Gnome joins in with a sunshine spell from a scroll. There was a blood curdling scream followed by nothing.\nCrush jumps thru the hole and walks back out a few seconds later with a chest plate.\n\n\nCrush: \"Here Stupid Dwarf.NEVER doubt Crush again!\"\nStubborn Dwarf: *stunned into silence.*\n\nokay okay more next time.\n\nedit:spacing...sorry still nooby at reddit.",

        "text": "The Party at the beginning of this account:\n\n* Ianya, Half Elf Ranger (Beastmaster) without Animal Companion as of yet. **Yet.**\n* Svetlana, Human Fighter/Paladin (4/1) (Archer)\n* Kizmet, Gnomish Rogue (Acrobat)\n* Asuryan, Human Cleric (NPC)\n\n[Previously on the Fateless Campaign...](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1xm4bh/pathfinder_in_the_depths_of_the_formian_hive/)\n\n**Retcons** from last time:\n\n1) The treasure hauled out from the chamber with the Dragon eggs was much greater than I remembered. Here is the full count:\n\n* A not-a-mistweave chain shirt, cursed (Currently worn by Ianya*)\n* Some ceramic wafers with chop/stamp that may be currency\n* A miscellaneous bag o' loot from chest #2 - not yet examined\n* A pennant with a green field and golden lamp from Lyonesse (A state to the South of our current position, one amongst the thousands in that region.)\n* 4 large, presumably free-range eggs, unhatched\n* A one-stringed harp? as yet unplucked\n* A golden wreath, as yet unworn\n* A pair of greaves, ditto \n* A magic ship battery or something like. \n* A map that updates with the geographic knowledge of anyone who holds it.\n\n2) The manner of our exit was retconned, and was no quite so epic. This account starts from the beginning of the retconn.\n\n*Ten Minutes after exit from the Treasure Chamber*\n\n*Changeling...* And now Ianya's armour is speaking to her. Perhaps putting the armour on was a poor idea. Changeling? And now she was Fey-Blooded. This was just wonderful.\n\n*Beast-Kin...* Wonderful, just wonderful. There were different types of Changeling. And now she was one of them! How lovely.\n\n*Raven-Brood...* For whatever that mea- It was at this point Ianya could feel the crawling: Around the crown of her skull, her hair follicles. And then her skin, her bones!\n\nIanya vomited, collapsed, dangling on the edge of conciousness. Hurriedly, Kizmet smears some of the last jelly on her wounds. It's the second-last of the regenerative variant, and it swiftly brings her to the point of being able to continue.\n\n**First level**\n\nFormians, unfortunately, are not idiots. The party dare not use the main passages (they have not yet devolved into breeches-on-head lunacy.) At first they made for the passage they entered through. Collapsed. So they looked for another. And another. And another. Collapsed, Collapsed, Collapsed.\n\nEach minute longer they spend within the hive increases the risks. Dead Formians smell, and those two soldiers they left behind on level two won't remained unknown for long.\n\nEventually, the party scrambles upon an uncollapsed tunnel. However, that is swiftly being taken care of. Seven workers hack away at the tunnel walls. But they aren't the problem. The problem is the Warrior sized Formian, Spear gripped with two hands (another two, equipped with chitin bludgeons but no manipulators) and the bulbous eyes. The party as they stand are out of site by the virtue of a wide bend in the tunnel.\n\nFirst, Kizmet uses the last of the regenerative jelly.\n\nThe vague impression of a plan is formed: Kizmet sneaks as close as he can (not likely to be very far, given the distinct lack of cover in the tunnel) then Svetlana and Ianya burst around the corner, fill it full of arrows, whilst Asuryan moves up to distract it to allow Kizmet to flank it.\n\nKizmet manages to make 20 of the 40 feet in between them before the Soldier spots him.\n\nThe Soldier turns, levels his spear, and screams. The Scream that resounds from it is really quite impressive, made even more so by the virtue of the tunnels. Several screams respond, and beneath the party's feet the ground begins to vibrate ever so slightly.\n\nDeciding not to be as stupid as to charge someone with a readied brace weapon (after prodding by Ianya's player,) Kizmet decides to use his chain gauntlets to loop over the spear and land on top of it.\n\nThe up is done very well. The down... Not so much. It's less a stab and more a *thump, bounce, thump* as Kizmet rolls onto the ground underneath it.\n\nThe party swings into action, as Asuryan runs forward, the magical shield emanating from her left forearm expanding outwards and outwards, her spear shooting outwards from it's grip, as she moves forwards to engage it, not charging, moving forward to threaten it. Asuryan issues a jab, concentrating more on the defence, and it bounces off.\n\nSvetlana and Ianya throw themselves around the corner, letting fly a pair of arrows. Bounce, Bounce. (Terrible rolls ahoy!) Inside her, Ianya feels something. The beginning of a burning. Her hand clamps down steadier on the bow, she draws the bowstring back a little tighter. (Meta: Side effect of her armour. For every miss she gets +1 to attack/damage, stacking until she gets a hit.)\n\nThe Soldier has fewer issues (and a +12 attack bonus hardly hurt) but sometimes it isn't enough. *Thump* *thump* go the Claws at Kizmet. The Soldier has a bit of a dilemma. Facing either of it's opponents leaves it exposed to the others. The small one is more annoying. *Thump* *Thump* goes the claws. The Spear dangles from it's limbs, too long to be useful. *Ow* goes Kizmet.\n\nThe tremors grow larger.\n\nKizmet dives between it's legs, striking at it's back before it can turn. This time it hits, slashing deep into it's back.\n\nSvetlana and Ianya take their second round of shots. One of Svetlana's lands. Ianya's Arrow does not. Ianya's Simmering grows. The hand grips tighter, the hand pulls back further. Asuryan gets a stab in this time.\n\nThe soldier goes for the small thing with the green too-large hair, turning it's back on the rest of the party. *Thump* *Ow* *Thump* *Ow.* *Thud* As Kizmet collapses to the ground, his wounds already growing over from the jelly. The tremors grow louder still, and if the party had the time to listen they must just hear the furtherest patter of endless waves of feet...\n\nKizmet spends his round going from 0hp to 1hp, springing back into life and taking another swing at it. Not this time unfortunately. Svetlana, Ianya take their shots. This time Ianya makes it, slipping an arrow between chitin plates along with one of one of Svetlana's.\n\nAsuryan takes a different course of action. Forcing her way around the Soldier by scrabbling around the curved sides of the tunnel, she makes it over to the other side, the light of the outside world a mere thirty feet away. Consuming one of her last spells, she forces life into Kizmet, forces him back to proper vitality, then turns to face the Soldier once more.\n\n*Run!* She screams.\n\nThe feet can be heard, the tremors pounding at the walls now, tiniest rocks begin to fall where the works dig, dig, dig...\n\nKizmet, then Svetlana, then Ianya do so, Svetlana taking a bludgeon as the Soldier lashes out whippet fast as the two archers make they way the Soldier.\n\nKizmet is the first one of them to see the sky in... How long has it been? He can see the smoke and smouldering piles where Nikkaye has been doing her work. Some of the fires are much newer than the others.\n\nA Cry, a Roar that could topple mountains. Nikkaye is still around it seems.\n\nBehind him a scream, as the Bludgeons and the spear lash out, as Asuryan screams, screams and screams again, then falls.\n\nOh Gods! They can feel them, thundering up the bend!\n\nKizmet unslings his bow. Asuryan is half his size again, heavy armour. There nothing he can do for her.\n\nIanya is less burdened by her size. Casting her bow aside, she hooks her arms around Asuryan's limp arms, hand still clasped around her spear, and begins dragging. Svetlana takes a final shot at the soldier, finding it's knee. It staggers, collapsing to a kneel... Then rises again (It had 1 hp. 1) stows her bow and grabs Asuryan's legs.\n\nOh Gods! They can see them! They'd reach the outside before the Formains perhaps. At least they'd die under the sun.\n\nSuddenly, a pair of vast claws reach into the ends of the tunnel, forces the tunnel mouth wide with all the subtlety of a troop of bards, as Nikkaye's head interposes itself into the Breach. Nikkaye, it seemed, at not forgotten them.\n\nRenewed, Ianya and Svetlana charge faster, dragging their dying charge past the Dragon's mouth.\n\nAnd then the Flames, as a thousand Formians die beneath the Dragonfire, the tunnel becoming their doom as the fire coils and circles further and further down the tunnel.\n\nThe party would like nothing more than to collapse for a hour, maybe three (maybe five?) but they've got a dying compatriot on their hands. Svetlana and Kizmet drag her armour off, cutting the straps if need be, as Ianya's hands dive for her healer's kit. Eventually, Asuryan's conciousness briefly drags itself to the surface, long enough for her last spell to make it permanent.\n\nMade it.\n\n",

        "text": "The Group:\n\nDr. Lucky Boots - A morally ambiguous Prewar scientist with no charisma. Specializes in energy weapons, science, and repair. Talks like Professor Frink from the simpsons. Glaven.\n\nSven Binsyen - A Prewar butcher and black market profiteer. A hoss in melee, Sven is also a very agressive trader possessed of a silver tongue. He's also a Russian evacuated from Chinese invasion forces in Russia and then Alaska, so he hates the Chinese. After settling down in the U.S. mainland, he became involved with the mob, disposing of bodies for them. Yeah, he sold human meat.\n\nSimon Smith - Every vault needs a janitor right? Prewar mob peon. Simon holds his cards close to his chest, telling everyone he's a janitor and thats how he got in the vault. The truth is that he's a low level mob enforcer and get-away driver. He excels at unarmed combat, driving, and skills related to commiting crime.\n\nThe Story continues:\n\nIn the aftermath of the celebration over Big Dorothy, questions were being asked of the party by the Caravaneers. It was clear that they wanted to know where the group had traveled from, so Simon gives them a bullshit story about how they're from New Jersey. Carlos Dirtshoe didnt really buy it, but agreed to dress them up as Caravaneers and lead them to Fort Smith since they saved his life and all.\n\nAnd so they traveled and traded with the Caravaneers, retelling the story of Big Dorothy for their amusement. On arrival at Fort Smith, they are told to not talk to the gate guards and to let them have any small piece of loot they ask for. One of the gate guards, a Pistol Smith soldier by the name of Cody Diggens stops by their vehicle and inspects a clip of 10mm ammo. Popping out a few bullets, he examines them, exclaiming, \"Them things aint never been fired!\". He pockets the ammo, telling the players to come trade with him sometime.\n\nOnce inside, The Caravaneers take them to the garage owned by their faction. Here they meet Lucky's brother, Shifty Tradesman. Introductions are barely over before Sven begins dickering for their own Dirtboot. The trading goes back and forth, but ultimately a deal is struck: the group will give up the Murdercycle, most of their caps, and their mint-condition sniper rifle in exchange for a Dirtboot, the work necessary to mount their robot flamer arm on the robot leg in the back, and a new melee weapon created from Big Dorothy's stinger and Batguy's bat.\n\nEven so, Shifty isnt quite ready to deal, so Sven sweetens the pot. He begins relaying the Legend of Big Dorothy in his russian accent to Shifty, \"There we were being attacked by the terrible giant radscorpion Big Dorothy. I heaved my spear but it was too weak to kill this monster. However--he gestures to the rifle--Dr. Luckyboots was there with this sniper rifle and he saved me by shooting her many times until she died. (Sven picks up the claw of Big Dorothy and slams it down on the table with a heavy thunk.) For price of Dirtboot, we give you claw with rifle and I name new weapon you make Shifty's Stinger.\"\n\n\"Speech check please.\" *Crit*!\n\nShifty is very impressed by this offer. \"Wow, the claw of Big Dorothy and the rifle that brought her down!\" He agrees to start working on mounting the flamer on their Dirtboot and making Sven's new weapon. He also immediately names his sniper rifle \"Little Dorothy\". Little does he realize that Big Dorothy was killed with a laser rifle.\n\nTheir new ride secured, the group spread out to explore Fort Smith. The home of the Pistol Smiths is in the ruins of an airforce base in the actual Fort Smith, Arkansas. The faction controls the large buildings still standing, but allows outsiders to camp on the tarmac where a shanty town of sorts exists. The Pistol Smiths are relative newcomers to the region. At one time they were nomadic traders similar to the Caravaneers, but a few generations ago they seized the area from local raiders and somehow recovered enough heavy industry to make their own guns and ammo. Their principal exports are simple and reliable rifles/shotguns/pistols good for hunting or personal defence but of limited use on offense. They maintain their own arsenal of automatics, energy weapons and armor.\n\nThe Pistol Smiths represent themselves as a meritocratic organization, but it's more of a pyramid scheme. Knowledge of operating heavy industry is closely closeted by the leaders at the top and succession is usually hereditary; those with actual skills might be able to work their way up the ladder to become a Smith eventually (it's a name and a title), but most will not. The Pistol Smiths do not practice slavery per se, but will take in anyone as a contract laborer. Once you sign on however, you become a lower class citizen trapped in a cycle of ever-increasing debt to the company store. Gotta read that fine print!\n\nIt is in this environment the group finds itself waiting for their Dirtboot to be finished. How much trouble could they possible get into?\n\nMore to come!",

Festivities where being arranged for the royal wedding between the houses of Nurmidor and a Eastern city named Othlond. \n\nWhile Raymond (Human Cleric) was practicing his moves on the altar, further away from the throne room, Marcus (Elf Ranger) was having another altrication with his fellow fellowers of Ehlonna in the Temple. \n\nB'hrian (dwarf fighter) was camped outside the inner city and was sharing tales with his friends of the bodyguard of Othlonds rulers. He just escorted Basil (halfling rogue) to the dungeons beneath the throne room. He will be judged for stealing religious artifacts in the Othlond surroundings.\n\nThe wedding started the next morning and Cleric Raymond felt a little nervous but was prepared to do his job. Marcus was attending and B'hrian was also in the throne room, guarding his masters. All Basil was trying to do was figuring out what three stones that made clear sounds when smashed together were doing in his dungeon and how he was going to break out.\n\nChaos ensued, when a dark portal opened and the bride to be was not lead to the altar but to some netherworld. People fell into the hole created, but not Marcus, the Elf, who sprinted away to get his bow. His immediate exit made him miss out on the rest of the action, but his natural 20 on perform while running made sure he was looking good doing it.\n\nWhile Raymond took care of a few survivors, B'hrian found himself in the dungeon where he locked Basil away not 24 hours ago. Searching the dungeon for clues as to what happened, he encountered Basil in his cell and helped him get out. \n\nIn the end, Raymond was awarded membership of a prestigious Order for him helping a noble survivor. The rulers of Nurmidor and Othlond immediately dispatched a search party for the missing bride and who was behind this evil deed. Marcus, stubborn as he was, was eventually forced by his temple leader (*the DM*) to be part of this search party and the party soon almost was wiped out.",

        "text": "The following is a session diary from my group's playthrough of the Pathfinder AP \"Wrath of the Righteous\", so be ye warned that spoilers of varying degrees are present. We play once a week, and I try to have a diary typed up before each session so everyone can remember what the hell we did last time. If y'all enjoy the style, I'm interested in putting the whole series up here/updating as we go. Again, if you're planning on playing WotR, SPOILERS. \n\nThe party is composed of the following members, in alphabetical order:\n\nBabbington Tetherby, a halfling Ninja whose skills at hiding are matched only by his skills at ingratiating himself to people who might pay him money. Although ragged on by the party for being a gold-hungry sneak-thief, he is actually quite generous with his money and has shown himself a staunch ally, putting friends before loot.\n\nBarid Gloridae, a young Paladin of Iomedae whose official paladin confirmation was interrupted by the terrible demonic assault on Kenabres. He has acquired a glowing sword and an awesome cloak, and is well-pleased by this. Always the frontlines of battle, loves charging at evil things.\n\nCehlia Iomae, an Aasimar Inquisitor of Iomedae. Raised in a small town outside of Kenabres, she journeyed to the city to lend her aid in the witchhunts, only to become embroiled in the terrible demonic assault. Loves the spell Command, and wields Daze with ridiculous efficacy for a 0-level spell. Favors not killing people if the opportunity presents itself, but only so they can spread the party's reputation to other evildoers.\n\nHodden, an ex-prince (150 years ago) Ranger flung forward through time by the machinations of a demon by the name of Bzar Ngu (sp?). Wields a greatsword with furious strength and constantly smokes cigars. Collects the ears of his slain foes, keeping them strung on a bandolier. Has a lot of ears.\n\nMaldrek Fiendsbane, a tiefling Cleric of Sarenrae. Used in terrible demonic research by a group of cultists until he escaped, now he wanders the world doing good and Channeling Energy. Recently landed his third hit of the four-month campaign.\n\nFollowing the demonic attack on Kenabres, the party has so far fallen into a huge underground labyrinth, fought bugs and mutants, befriended some mutants, and returned above ground to find the city wrecked and evil stalking the street. Having dropped their accompanying NPCs off at relatively safe locations, they have joined up with some heroic defenders and are preparing to investigate cultist safehouses with hopes of finding some information to aid in the struggles against demons and such. \n\n\n\n**Session 14--**\n\tThe party perused the makeshift bazaar that had been set up in the Defender's Heart. They were able to find some more mundane items (Babbington, for instance, picked up some cold-iron weapons), but the more awesome things they were looking for (an enchanted shield for Barid, an enchanted headband for Cehlia) were not to be found. Maldrek drew some stares as he shopped around, purchasing a number of Cure Moderate Wounds scrolls, but Cehlia accompanied him to offset his threatening tiefling nature with the shining light of her angelic heritage. Hodden purchased a pack of vicious cheroots to occupy himself when not engaged in combat (and when engaged in combat as well). Babbington continued to browse, looking decidedly nonchalant. Finally, a hunched-over, partially-hooded man approached him and muttered “Unless I'm much mistaken, you might be in the market for some poisons” in a low, slimy voice. “POISONS?” yelled Babbington, majorly cocking up his Stealth check. “Poisons,” whispered the creepy guy nervously, glancing over his shoulder at Barid, obliviously making a tour of the defenses with the righteous air and bearing of a paladin among the militant faithful. Babbington made an extremely shady deal with the extremely shady guy, and found himself in possession of some contraband substances. Barid finished his tour of inspection, having discovered that although there was a sizable detachment of the Eagle's Watch among the defenders, the party seemed to be the good-guys' most formidable task force. This was slightly worrying, but also understandable. As the group prepared to leave for Topaz Solutions, they enjoyed a last moment of peace in the inn; Babbington bought a round (anonymously) for all the resting warriors—which did wonders for morale—and Cehlia took the time to write up an account of the party's victories against demonkind, posting it on the wall of the tavern in hopes of inspiring, well, hope in those who continued to struggle against the demonic forces. Having agreed on a plan (Cehlia would utilize her dragon scale to disguise as Hosilla to gain entry into Topaz Solutions), the party set out.\n\t\nUnsurprisingly, their journey was interrupted by a scream from a seemingly-deserted building along the street. Babbington, quick on the draw and mindless of bystanders, fired a cold-iron sling bullet through a window, but didn't seem to hit anything. The party got into the formation they knew best, and cautiously pushed open the door. The room they found themselves in was in terrible disarray, and a deformed, hunchbacked humanoid creature was clawing and biting at a pile of rags in the corner. Hearing Babbington's shot ping off the wall, it turned its ratlike face towards the door and hissed malevolently, baring its nasty, gnawing teeth and two-fingered, clawed hands. Maldrek and Cehlia laid hands on Barid's shoulders, putting Divine Guidance and Resistance on him, respectively. Barid was feeling like a goddamn tank. “It's a Wrecker Demon,” proclaimed Cehlia. “Filthy beasts.” “Is that a sort of evil outsider?” asked Hodden nonchalantly. “Definitely.” His face set into a satisfied grimace. “Aye.” Hearing sounds from behind a door, Maldrek called out “Is anyone there?” “God yes!” came a fervent cry from the other room. “Right!” said Barid, and charged.\n\t\nHe missed, the beast dodging nimbly aside and then striking back at him. Its immense incisors scraped across Barid's face and buried in his shoulder, leaving an ugly, Charisma-draining wound. Hodden let rip a horrifying scream and charged like a steroid-empowered rhinoceros, dealing a huge chunk of damage. Babbington snuck up along the outside of the house to peer in the picture window, still unseen by the demon. Maldrek ran in to support Hodden and Barid, while Cehlia stepped inside to Lend a Judgment to Barid, granting him Fast Healing. In what was fast becoming his go-to move, Barid Overran the demon, establishing flanking for Hodden. The demon, seeming to sense the danger this put it in, took a massive bite—not at Hodden, but at his sword. Its teeth clashed on the blade with enough force to shatter bone, but fortunately it was made of steel and seemed unaffected. It clawed at Barid and Maldrek, landing both hits but dealing negligible damage. Hodden struck out furiously in retaliation for this most-unsporting Sunder attempt, but missed. Babbington used this as a distraction to vault through the window and come up behind the demon, but failed to connect with his sneaky attack. Maldrek stepped full in front of the beast and raised his holy symbol of Sarenrae, snarling “I shall see your ashes scattered before the Eternal Flame!” The demon cowered back from his righteous fury, Shaking in fear. Cehlia wound up a massive swing with her morningstar—too massive, as the weight of the weapon overextended her arm, causing her to pull a muscle and lose some effectiveness in her hittin' arm, and drop the morningstar. Barid swung and missed, and the demon launched another flurry of attacks, landing a claw on Maldrek but missing Barid and Cehlia. The air seemed thick with edged weaponry as Hodden also missed his attack. But Babbington realigned and stabbed into its tuckus with his new cold-iron wakizashi, dealing impressive sneak-attack damage. Maldrek also crunched into it with his mace, and Cehlia put forth her righteous power to finish the battle in a burst of Channeled Alignment...which again did one damage, causing the creature's matted fur to stand on end and not much else. But the demon had no real hope: although Barid missed his next attack, its desperate strikes were easily fended off by the intended targets and Hodden, the man for the job as always, wrecked its shit with a massive cut. \n\t\n“Poor beast,” said Cehlia, staring down at its ruined, now-earless corpse. “It shouldn't have come to this.”\n\t\n“Excuse me?” said Barid, poking gingerly at the throbbing gash running down the side of his face.\n\t\n“I just can't help but feel that...well, maybe we could have talked to it. Perhaps....”\n\t\n“It's a demon,” said Barid flatly. He looked at Cehlia, one eye squinted shut against the pain of the cut. “You think it wanted to be your friend?”\n\t\n“Well no!” she flared back at him. “But we didn't exactly give it a chance, did we? Is that what you think, that you can just kill whatever and call it evil and that absolves you of everything?”\n\t\n“Lass,” said Hodden, puzzled, “the boy's got a point. I's a demon. Chaotic evil made flesh. They are evil. They cannae change it, no more'n Hodden can give 'em a pass on it.”\n\t\n“And I'm sure you've given that lots of contemplation, and reached a rational decision on the subject,” retorted Cehlia, coolly eyeing Hodden's grisly bandolier. She turned back to Barid. “A fine way to spread the faith you have, paladin—at sword's length. Is that what you think Iomedae is? A reason to pat yourself on the back for killing?”\n\t\n“But...it's...look!” sputtered Barid. “They can't—you can't convert a demon! They're evil, pure evil! They'll murder you without a thought, and they only talk to us to tell us how much it's going to hurt! I could understand...people, I could understand, they can choose, but this is ridiculous!” He turned away abruptly, the sword-and-sunburst flaring weakly on his tattered red cloak. Hodden looked slowly between his angry back and Cehlia's set glare, and meditatively exhaled a thick cloud of foul smoke. He prodded the corpse with the toe of his boot and fingered the still-warm, slightly furred ears now hanging by his shoulder. “Don' see what all the fuss is about,” he muttered to his cigar, then shrugged and put it back in his mouth; a few moments, and another puff of smoke rolled out to haze the air around him.\n\t\nThe pained silence gave way to wary excitement as everyone remembered that someone had responded to Maldrek's earlier inquisition, and the party discovered that there were people! and friendly people too. Barid, still in high dudgeon, Detected Evil at them, but they turned up clean. They were a married couple, tailors of the finest degree. The demon appeared to have been so focused on ruining the fineries in the shop that it had left them for last, for which they were immensely grateful. They offered to make the party fine clothes in gratitude for their rescue, but the party decided that, based on the amount of foul substances they had been sprayed with and spurted by, lace and fripperies might be somewhat wasted on them. Instead, Cehlia proposed that they put their talents to work to help a young dwarven couple at the Defender's Heart whose planned wedding had been ruined by the demonic invasion: a beautiful wedding might be just the thing to bolster morale among the beleaguered defenders. Babbington offered to pay them handsomely for their work, and Maldrek was to officiate the ceremony upon the party's return to the Defender's Heart. It was a real swell decision all around.\n\t\nThe party continued on, finally approaching Topaz Solutions. While it wasn't destroyed like the Nyserian Manor had been, the door was hanging off its hinges and the party could discern no movement inside. They steeled themselves, then Cehlia Altered herSelf, becoming a spitting image of Hosilla. She shouldered the dead inquisitor's glaive and marched boldly toward the entrance, the rest of the party right behind. “I have new material for the Archives,” she declared, as they marched into the quiet gloom of the shop.",

        "author": "TwoHeadedCyclops",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1znyga/advanced_dungeons_and_dragons_the_creation_of/",
        "text": "So during my 5th ever time playing ADND, it was my 2nd time actually being a PC. I was more than excited to create the conjuring mage that I always wanted to be. My stats were descent with an outstanding 16 constitution and 17 intelligence as a start so I was super hyped. However I knew that most of the awesome conjuring spells don't really start to appear until the later levels so I was very limited as to which spells to start with. I had the idea at the time that I didn't really want to be very forward with my spells, so as to not be direct with any future plans that my mage may have as on a side note for his back story, he was a tactician in training (planning on using his summoned monsters as pieces in chess represent a battle) and seeing as how he was a conjurer he was going to be very snobbish and insult peoples intelligence as most conjurers see themselves as the highest form of magic users. So looking through the players hand book I found what would soon be Adam's signature spell, conjure grease. My DM was thoroughly confused. The spell had said that as long as the mage had some sort of oily grease substance or butter, the mage could make a magical grease that was always slippery causing the enemy to be trapped in it to roll a saving through or fall flat on there ass. \n\nSo there was Adam in the new group with the summon grease and summon mount spells at his finger tips. (the only mount he is able to summon at the moment however was a weak horse for maybe about an hour) During his travels Adam had figured out that grease can catch fire and if compressed correctly can act as a small but useful fire splash, he essentially figured out how to make a Molotov cocktail. However he had not used his magic grease to do so, I as a person in real life did not expect what happened next. One day the group was in a pickle and was essentially starting to die left and right with the only two healers out of battle as they were keeping the rest of the group alive, and having the other half (a half elf bard and Adam himself) fighting for their lives. \n\nAs the bard fought decently with his long sword, Adam was luckily dodging every physical attack thrown at him and running around in circles. The half elf managed to some how get all of the enemies to attack him for a short while giving Adam a chance to think. He then came up with the brilliant idea of putting some butter in a glass flask and using the spell to create the grease, then rip off some of his cloth sash and use his flint and steel to catch it on fire. \n\nI as a person only thought that it would act as a simple Molotov, my DM on the other hand had other thoughts. Adam throws the Molotov in an attempt to save the half elf, after landing the hit the Molotov not only bursts into flames but also explodes hard enough to leave a crater on the floor. The half elf somehow made it out with 2 hp, the enemies on the other hand weren't so lucky. The group stops and looks at Adam. Adam slowly grows a grinch smile. I as a player had no arguments with this. From then on Adam carried around a bandoleer of those glass flasks filled with grease and carried around ten of what he called \"butter skins\" which were water skins filled to the brim with nothing but butter and food grease. This was especially disgusting when he would reach for his wallet as he kept it under his pants on is left thigh so thieves could not pickpocket him. \n\nThere was one occasion were the DM actually got the group in prison from a corrupt king and took away all of the groups items. However during lunch when the guards would bring crappy food to the group, Adam was always armed and luckily had some spell charges left over from his last reading session. The conversation went something like this:\n\nDM: the guards bring sloppy nasty food for all of you to eat and continually call you maggots.\n\nMe: may I ask what specifically is in this food?\n\nDM: some bread pieces and some old wet meat that doesn't look fit for a dog.\n\nMe: So how greasy is this meat?\n\nDM: If you turn the platter oil just falls from the plate and it....OH GOD DAMIT NO!!! WHAT HAVE I DONE!\n\nME: wait what exactly is the material we are wearing made of.\n\nDM: I forget exactly what it's called but it's a bit thicker than cloth but not exactly leather either... DAMIT not only did I give you a weapon, I gave you something to hold it in.\n\nAdam then made a makeshift grease sack that he hid under his thigh wear his wallet use to be. Later in prison they were sentenced to trial by combat having everything riding on our best fighter to win the lives of the rest of the group. Adam then revealed what he had slowly been building behind bars, and told the fighter to use this as a last resort to give himself the upper hand during battle.\n\nThis was long in Adams travels so by now he also knew the blind spell and was just close enough to use it, so he told the fighter he would help from the side lines as best he can. During the start of the battle the fighter landed a critical hit to the enemies head, at that moment Adam used a blind spell on the enemy and then an audible glamer in the crowd to have one of the civilians sound like they said, \" the force of the blow must have blinded him!\" The fighter then very quickly threw down the small grease sack having it spread a bit under the enemy and then failing the saving through, the fighter took care of the rest. \n\nOne more memorable action of Adam the grease mage was what we like to call the horse bomb. During one of Adams earlier adventures, the group had to join with another joining member, but story wise they were crossing the sea and later realizing that they were on a pirate ship and tried to help save a merchant ship that the pirates were attacking where they would meet the new member on the merchant ships deck. \n\nAdam quickly explaining the situation and then proving that they were not the enemy to this new member asked for the merchants help. The merchant, who later explained that he was only on board to protect the merchandise and was not actually a merchant, was very skilled with a bow and asked how he could help. Adam had earlier summoned a horse from the crows nest were he was reading allowing it to fall and instantly kill a pirate below him (don't worry it wasn't a real horse it later disappeared after the spell wore off), and was about to use it again. While the rest of the group fought off the pirates Adam summoned another horse with his last remaining horse hair, and pored magical grease all over the horse. The new guy couldn't help but be confused. Adam then explained that his grease can act as a bomb to ignite any gun powder that he would be willing to part the cannons from. The new guy had a better idea, he had showed Adam an excess of pitch on the ship. (for those who don't know pitch is a very flammable substance used to water proof a sea vessel usually made of coal tar, wood tar, or petroleum) They then put as much pitch as the horse could carry on its back and sent it to the pirate ship on a crossing board. It luckily made it over and the pirate ship which was slowly catching fire eventually ignited the horse. I suppose at this point the DM said fuck it you won the encounter anyway, so the horse then exploded tearing what was left of the ship apart. \n\nAdam the grease mage is one of my favorite creations and is presently about to make a catapult which will launch his grease bombs at enemy flesh golems which are being mind controlled by a great necromancer which is holding a kingdom hostage. unfortunately due to group meeting issues it is on hold, but I someday hope to launch that catapult....Someday.              \n\n ",

Specializes in energy weapons, science, and repair. Talks like the scientist guy from the simpsons.\n\nSven Binsyen - A Prewar butcher and black market profiteer. A hoss in melee, Sven is also a very agressive trader possessed of a silver tongue. He's also a Russian evacuated from Chinese invasion forces in Russia and then Alaska, so he hates the Chinese. After settling down in the U.S. mainland, he became involved with the mob, disposing of bodies for them. Yeah, he sold human meat.\n\nThe Story:\n\nAfter mopping up the raiders the group gathered all the loots, including Batguy's bat, and met the people in the broken truck whose lives they had saved. These folk were Lucky Tradesman and Carlos Dirtshoe; each belonging to one of several hereditary trading clans collectively known as the Caravaneers. \n\nDr. Lucky Boots sets to healing Lucky's shotgun wound while Carlos gets to fixing his Dirtboot. While doing these things, the group learns more about the Caravaneers and the raiders they were fighting.\n\nThe Caravaneers are a minor faction more or less allied with the Pistol Smiths against hostile raiders. However, they retain most of their autonomy due to their superior vehicle technology and seek to trade with as many communities as possible.\n\nThe Dirtshoe clan is responsible for the manufacture of a distinctive style of truck called a Dirtboot. It's a single cab 4wd pickup stripped down to the essentials and covered in brahmin leather barding to help in concealment. The Tradesman clan members are more generalized salvagers, tinkerers, and traders.\n\nThe raiders they fought belonged to the Sons of David, the premier motorcycle gang in New Branson. They had attacked the caravan and cut one of the trucks from the herd. A search reveals the raider's bike, which has 2 sidecars. The group commandeers the vehicle, rechristening it the Murdercycle, and sets off with the Caravaneers to rejoin the caravan.\n\nThe next session started with the caravan, but Simon was late to join us. So instead of going straight to Fort Smith as planned, the caravan detoured to a new place called Canyon Town so that Sven and Dr. Lucky Boots could dick around on side shit.\n\nCanyon Town is an independent community that exists on the margins of the 3 big factions. Thus it is home to outcasts, vagabonds, escaped slaves, tribals, deserters and the like. However, it is a safe place to spend the night if you pay the toll. The Caravaneers are a welcome sight tho, so a bunch of the townsfolk come out with their goods and immediately start trading. \n\nDuring this encounter they meet 1 trader, well known by Carlos, known as the Yella Hair. He is one unpleasant fuck who drives a hard bargain. However, he is also the only one that wants to buy their broke ass raider guns, so they trade with him anyways, feeling chipped off.\n\nThen the 2 heros decide they want to wander around outside and kill stuff. Ok, Random Encounter! *Dice roll*...giant radscorpion! Fuck yeah.\n\nAlright guys, yal walk out of sight of the village and outside of the canyon. You begin walking out into the wasteland and crest a small rise. On the other side is a giant radscorpion who...*dice roll*... sees you and begins charging, clacking its pincers in anticipation.\n\nSven Binsyen heaved a raider spear at the beast, catching a chink in it's armor and Dr. Lucky Boots blasted it with his laser rifle as it came at them. It reached them and began lashing out with claws and stinger, but every hit was successfully dodged. Dr. Lucky Boots critted once more and the giant Radscorpion was finished (energy weapons are broken). They harvested part of the tail, the poison, the eggs, and 1 claw and returned to Canyon Town.\n\nBack in the canyon, the townsfolk and traders are looking at Sven and Luckyboots when they walk up. At the sight of the large claw in Sven's hands, one of them cries out, \"They killed Big Dorothy!\" A hush settles over the crowd.\n\nTo be followed by a commotion. \"Hooray! They killed Big Dorothy!\" And the people of Canyon Town celebrated the death of the local menace, Big Dorothy the giant radscorpion.\n\nYet as thankful of this as the villagers and traders were, it also brought serious questions to mind. Who were these mysterious strangers in mismatched raider gear and able to slay giant radscorpions? Where had they come from?\n",

A Prewar mob peon, Simon holds his cards close to his chest, telling everyone he's a janitor and thats how he got in the vault. The truth is that he's a low level mob enforcer and get-away driver. He excels at unarmed combat, driving, and skills related to commiting crime.\n\nThe Story:\n\nThe Overseers consulted the ~210 year old maps of the area on their Pip-Boys, concluding that they are in the state of Arkansas. They decide to head towards the nearest population center, Fort Smith. \n\nWhilst trekking through the waste however, gunshots are heard and investigated. The group crests a hill to find a group of raiders attacking 2 men defending a broken truck. They are undecided which group to support at first, but once they ascertain that the lead attacker has a pink mohawk they figure those raiders got to die.\n\nSo one raider with a rifle is sniping at the truck while the majority of them are advancing through cover towards the guys with the broken truck. Simon and Sven begin sneaking down the hillside towards the sniper, while Dr. Lucky Boots gets in a position to cover them with his laser rifle.\n\nA successful bout of sneaking sees the sniper ganked rather efficiently by a powerfist. Dr. Lucky Boots fries the pink mohawk guy assaulting the truck with a shotgun, and the raider force splits itself to deal with these new threats.\n\nIn the ensuing combat, guns were useless. By the will of the dice, every raider holding a gun died a horrible death the first time they were targetted. A Stalingrad-esque scene unfolded with several raiders picking up the same dropped shotgun in their assault of the truck. I think 3 men died holding that weapon, the last one getting a lucky shot off on one of the truck people.\n\nHowever, let it be known that these raiders were not helpless. While the shotgun baton is being handed off repeatedly, the 2 raiders attacking Simon and Sven are faring much better with their pool stick and baseball bat. In fact, the one with the baseball bat has Simon on the ropes. It is only when the other raiders are taken out and the full attention of the party is focused on them that the tide of battle turns.\n\nPool-stick dies somehow and the last raider runs away into the wasteland. Describing this, I incidentally referred to him as \"Batguy\", using his weapon as an identifying factor.\n\nDr. Lucky Boots: \"Wait, he's dressed like Batman?\"\n\nMe: \"Umm....yes. Yes he is.\"\n\nand thus Batguy the returning character was born. He's been grinding in the wasteland ever since, waiting for the day he can have his revenge on the party. If the party ever goes to New Branson, it is likely they'll encounter him there.\n\nBATGUY KNOWS NO FEAR! BATGUY FEELS NO PAIN!",

They begin to question the auto-doc and find out that they have been frozen for ~210 years, the robots in their vault are malfunctioning, and the auto-doc has been waking people up periodically and tasking them with fixing everything. \n\nYou see, what happened is that their vault was an experiment in cryogenic stasis and automation. Everything went like clockwork for awhile, until something breached the vault ~100 years ago. The next shift of workers to be awoken decided to manufacture more robots and reprogram them to defend the vault against future incursions, but bad programing causes the robots to defend the vault against EVERYTHING, including their masters.\n\nSo the group begins asking about the number of people still frozen, but this line of questioning leads the auto-doc to begin sequencing to unfreeze more cryogenically frozen vault dwellers and stops answering their questions. They sneak out of the medbay and through a few rooms of the vault, grabbing whatever they can find: a 10mm pistol here, a used power fist there, and oh look, a mint condition sniper rifle with 1 bullet. They scoop up these things and others, then they stumble upon the breach which is guarded by robots. They fight the robots, crushing a couple of the worker variety. However, they can hear the stentorian voices of a squad of Mr. Gutsy's coming so they quickly loot a robot flamer-arm and a leg and run out into the waste at night.\n\nRandom Encounter time! They encounter *dice roll*....a mole-rat. Fuck. Whatever, they crush it or scare it away or something and hideout in a rock crevice until dawn. The sun shines on an alien landscape as they set off into the wasteland to find their fortune.\n\n",

        "text": "I was DMing a game with a character who was a paladin of Palor (we house ruled some 3rd edition deities) searching for the vampire that killed his family. He was raised in a monastery and had spent his entire life training. While the rest of the party was staying at an inn he was bunking at the local church and helping out with the duties of the clergy.\n\nWell he found out that the vampire lord he had been hunting was a just a hundred miles away and had secured a position as the vizier to the baron of that area.\n\nDuring this time another character who was a tiefling sorceress had been researching her infernal ancestry and made contact with a devil (this wasn't planned, the player was doing this of her own accord). She asked for more power and the devil told her to spy on her paladin friend.\n\nSo Mr.Paladin ends up being tricked into going to a glen where a man is waiting for him. The man promises to help him defeat the vampire lord if the paladin abandons Palor in favor of the dark god he serves. The man then reveals that he is a devil and hands the paladin a key that will open a temporary portal a demi-plane of hell when a magic word is spoken (limit once per day).\n\nThe paladin almost kills him right there but stays his hand just long enough for the devil to flee.\n\nSo after much deliberation the tiefling and paladin use the key to take part in a dark ritual. As a reward the tiefling gains many benefits from the half-fiend template.\nNow at this point I was not expecting this to go that far. \n\nHalf the party just made pacts with a dark god. How is this going to play out?\n\nSo the antipaladin is given a dagger that has a one-time use ability to instantly destroy a vampire if it can pierce their heart (the dagger will then turn to dust with the vampire) he is also given some armor with the unholy symbol clearly displayed. \n\nWell to make a long story slightly shorter he fucks up and one of the clergy from the church happens to walk by while he has his new armor in full display.\n\nThis eventually leads to a confrontation where the city guard and the congregation of Palor manage to hunt down and ambush the villainous party members. At this point I think it is all over.\n\nNot remotely.\n\nThe antipaladin opens a portal with the key and throws it at the tiefling. The tiefling closes the portal and uses her new wings to fly away as fast as she can. She manages to escape. \n\nSo now the tiefling (who had purchased a hat of disguise a while ago to hide her new wings and horns) flies to the town that the vampire lord is in. She manages to get a private meeting with him and uses the key to open the portal. The antipaladin jumps out and destroys the vampire lord with the dagger. He then takes the hat of disguise and impersonates the vampire lord.\n\nTo this day the vizier of that barony is secretly the paladin in disguise.",

My friend is on board with this apparently.\n\nLast night, he visited the Dark Elf capital, Regias, in the wetlands of Irrsuno. He was stopped at the main gate. A typical 'state your business' ordeal. I expected him to make some sort of rational explanation to get in. I did not expect him to begin preaching about the glory of Helix.\n\nNow, I understand its meta, but awesome DM that I am, I let it go. \n\nSo he starts this big speech:\n\n\"He is a god of anarchy, a guide of truths.

And then he nat 20's the speech roll.\n\nAccording to my games rules, gods are created by their followers and vice versa. The more followers a god has, the more powerful.\n\nThe player who, up until today has done pretty much nothing except wander around just created a deity all on his own.

I had noticed a great deal of Blu entering through the sewers so I was continuously booby trapping the doorway. Just as I detonated and killed a pyro I saw Jesus run through the doorway. I accidentally switched to my grenade launcher which I had neglected to reload and thought \"Well crap i'm done for\". I set to reloading and awaiting a thorough blasting to my death.\n\nInstead Jesus just used the Voice Command and said \"No\" again and again. He refused to shoot me. For whatever reason I felt compelled to watch him and see what's going on here. He continued to spam \"No\" \"No\" \"No\". A Blu Soldier rounded the corner and after firing 1 rocket he paused and looked on as well. From behind me, as I stood completely open a blu spy uncloaked and joined the crowd. Soon the Red players began arriving on the scene and after taking initial pot shots not one single person continued to fire.\n\nBefore long the entire Blu and Red team were gathered at the top of the Red sewer stairs around Jesus watching him deliver his \"Sermon\" in peace. It was a true miracle and it lasted the entire match before it came to a stalemate.\n\nIn the next round Jesus called us all homos and disconnected.",

        "text": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1yyvx1/homebrew_fallout_rpg_the_siege_of_shitville_pt_1/\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1yztbl/homebrew_fallout_rpg_the_siege_of_shitville_pt_2/\n\nSpirits were high when we reconvened the next week. Finn Smith, who had missed the last session, began the turn order. By GM fiat he started inside of the fort with the 6 remaining Pistol Smith Soldiers. The raiders open up on them and the gatehouse gets very dangerous. The less experienced soldiers take cover, except for 1 guy named Travis with a laser rifle. This weapon would prove decisive in the battle for the gatehouse. Finn gets into the gatehouse and notices a vehicle coming down the road towards them before he takes cover too.\n\nA discussion of the overall raider strategy: Shitville is a lightly defended outpost of the Pistol Smith faction. It is relatively isolated from other large population centers by an area known as the Broken Hills. A large brahmin population invited this raider attack from New Branson though. They packed their motorcycles in the trailers and set off, intending to take back as many brahmin as could be fit in the trailers. Overwhelming force and intimidation were expected to win the day, possibly without a fight. \n\nHowever, once the Humongous and Wes (assless chaps) were killed, the plan devolved into a relatively brainless assault. Plan B went into effect: a lvl 1 suicide driver wearing metal armor got into the captured Pistol Smith truck and started accelerating towards the gate while the remaining bikers went in a broad pincer movment to cross the wall and flank the gatehouse. The remaining troops in the trucks and the machine gunners in the trailers opened up on the gatehouse, throwing lead into its rickety structure.\n\n...and back to the story! \n\nSven was chasing the meth-cow in the forest. He caught up to it as a pig-rat ambushed the meth-cow. Sven comes up behind the pig-rat and skewers it with a shish-kebab. However, the currents of metagaming engulfed Sven Binsyen, and he decided to abandon his chase of the meth-cow.\n\nHowever, the meth-cow was not done with him, it charged his backside and began trampling him. Sven countered with his melee weapons and the meth-cow ran off once more. I pointed out how great of a blood trail it was leaving, but Sven still rejoined the party at the Dirtboot. He didnt even take the pig-rat corpse.\n\nMeanwhile the group is busy working on the Dirtboot, trying to replace some shot-up parts with captured motorcycle shit. While they were doing this the battle for the gatehouse unfolded. \n\nMost of the NPC's are cowering, never having been under sustained suppression fire before. Oh, and it seems that Finn, although a Smith, has low charisma and no speech skill. But Travis is stoic as fuck and he starts shooting shit with his laser rifle. Finn grabs a rifle from one of the wimps and begins firing too. But really, it's all about Travis who pumps laser bolts into the hood of that vehicle (and the captives lashed to it), until it explodes.\n\nMeanwhile the raiders on motorocycles are lifting them over the walls (concrete barriers with barbed wire). Finn grabs a guy and hauls him into his motorcycle with sidecar to go counter the south side. Travis, getting shredded by machine guns, pours fire on the north from the gatehouse, but these raiders successfully dodge. The remaining 4 Pistol Smiths finally break and start running for the town itself.\n\nFinn rolls up on the south side, catching them in the process of lowering the first bike. They dispatch the exposed raider with gunfire, but 4 more are on the other side of the wall and a firefight ensues, each side trading shots. At the gatehouse, Travis is forced to take cover and perform first aid on himself, rejoining the battle much later. The raiders breach the north wall and ride at Finn, catching him in a crossfire. Finn responds with a shotgun and dynamite, decimating the raiders on the south wall and one of the motorbikes flanking him. He also catches 2 bullets, and is forced to take cover while his NPC buddy first aids him.\n\nMeanwhile the Dirtboot's engine roars to life and the party rattles off across the rock field in a broad flanking movement against the war-trailers. Simon traverses the field with no issue and onto the pavement, accelerates down the hillside and behind the war-trailers, whipped around so the rear-mounted flamer would face them and Dr. Lucky Boots toasted the first trailer with a crit. Did i mention Dr. Lucky Boots has improved crits? It's toasted.\n\nThe second trailer moves forward away from the Dirtboot while the other 2 reposition their machine guns. Simon whips around again and Dr. Lucky Boots crits the second trailer, whoomf! Everyone piles out of the Dirtboot and takes cover. The 2 remaining trailers open up on the Dirtboot, damaging it beyond repair. The players begin shooting and hucking dynamite at the last 2 trailers as they reposition, catching one of the machine gunners. \n\nIn a daring move, Simon attempts a run check across the open ground to the slow moving vehicles, success. Now a jump check to leap onto the one with a crewed machine gun, then a climb check up to the nest, successes. Now called shot to punch him in the head with a powerfist, success. Roll damage, con check for raider, he's unconcious. Simon turns the lmg on the other war-trailer, expending all the ammo in bid to kill all of them. He succeeded.\n\nWait, what just happened. 15 raiders toasted or shot? that was half the raider force! And the motorcycle assault faltering? Shit. The party shoots the driver of the remaining war-truck (the one dragging Simon's trailer) and the surviving raiders bail out and head for the hills. Only 2 will make it out alive. Finn and his Pistol Smiths manage to knock out the remaining motorbikers with frag grenades.\n\nAnd so the looting of bodies and towing of vehicles began. Speculation for the next session is centered around the construction of a new vehicle, the Tankboot. Thanks for reading!",

Prewar mob peon.\n\nOiler Johnson - An escaped slave belonging to the New Branson Raiders.\n\nFinn Smith - Cousin of the General Smith of the Pistol Smith Faction. (not present at this meeting)\n\nThe group met for the next session with great anticipation, metagaming about the best plan for taking out the rest of these \"bitch ass raiders\". I smiled and showed them the map I'd created along with the map legend of terrain types and their various bonuses and negatives. Then the chase was on.\n\nAn angry raider wearing assless chaps begins screaming, \"We go in, we kill!\", a cry taken up by his fellow bikers as 7 of them begin chasing after the group in the Dirtboot. Simon immediately steered into the rocks heading towards a shrub-forest, forcing the rapidly gaining raiders to follow suit. \n\n4 PCs with 1 truck vs 10 raiders on 7 motorbikes\n\nNow, a rock patch isnt super dangerous. It slows you down and forces you to make a drive check or take damage to your car. However, this rock patch would prove the undoing of the raiders.\n\nThe Dirtboot and the first 3-4 motorbikes traverse the rocks with relative ease and begin a running engagement on the flat land between them and the shrub-forest. However, the 3 motorbikes with sidecars coming in support would fail their 75% drive checks for 3 more rounds. \n\nIn the running engagement, one raider is toasted by the flamer when he strays too close, but 2 others zoom around the truck and post up with smg's, shredding the Dirtboot and knocking it out of commission. The Group finds themselves on foot and low on ammunition, but they rally anway and charge the grounded raiders with smg's. Lucky for them the reinforcements are still bouncing around on rocks and cursing. They kill the raiders, grab their weapons and ammo and hightail it back to the edge of the forest to take cover.\n\nAt this point, Sven Binsyen decides to take off into the forest by himself. It should be noted that Sven likes to take a lot of drugs, particularly jet. Trying to move around to a different section of forest, he finds a feral brahmin with a broken halter and grabs it, initiating a grapple. He actually manages to tie the thing to a tree, but in a stroke of brilliance chooses to dose the brahmin with one of his many jets. The animal moos frantically, breaks the halter again and runs off. Sven laughs and pursues, his friends and the raider battle forgotten.\n\nMeanwhile, the lagging motorbikes and sidecars are taken out on arrival by the solid application of automatic weapons and dynamite from the 3 prepared PCs. I think 1 of the bikers might even have said fuck this and left the rocks in the other direction. Regardless, as the group begins to loot the bodies and attempt jury-rigged repairs to the Dirtboot a question is asked, \"What happened to Sven?\"\n\n\"End of session, collect your loot and go home.\"\n\n31 raiders vs 5 PCs and 6 NPCs",

        "text": "Background:  I kitbashed a bunch of rule-systems into a pulp-hero/sandbox style Fallout game. I've stayed true to the core themes of the Fallout universe, but I've taken creative licence with regard to vehicles (fuck yeah we got trucks). The setting is in Arkansas 10 years before the events of New Vegas where 3 large factions are struggling for dominance (Pistol Smiths, New Branson Raider Coalition, and the Ghouls of Rallipontcee).\n\nThe group is composed of 3 vault dwellers that awoke from cryogenic sleep in a malfunctioning vault, plus an escaped slave of the New Branson Raiders and a soldier for the Pistol Smith faction that have joined since.\n\nAfter many adventures that would take too long to retell, like the Legend of Big Dorothy, the group has arrived in the outpost of Smithville with their freshly rustled brahmin and a kind of truck called a Dirtboot. Smithville is immediately renamed Shitville because of the massive amount of brahmin (and shit) already there. They sell their brahmin to Shitty-foot Johnson for many caps and are all set to buy some loot and check out the crazy Apparatus in the warehouse when their idyllic investigations are hampered by the arrival of a large raider force outside the gates. They run to the gatehouse and see ~45 raiders with 4 armored trucks dragging trailers with machine gun nests arrayed on the hillside, with numerous motorcycles and a captured Pistol Smith truck complete with captives lashed to the hood.\n\nCue Lord Humongous and his rousing speech: \"There has been too much violence, too much pain. But Lord Humongous has an honorable solution. Just walk away! You may keep your guns and your trucks, but your brahmin are ours! Just walk away and we will give you safe passage through the wasteland! You have 1 day to decide before I unleash my dogs of war.\"\n\nAn opportunity to leave a fight with all their money and possessions? A full day to prepare for the battle? Nah, that would be too easy, so the group charges out of the fort and one of them challenges Lord Humongous to single combat, which ensues. Lord Humongous nearly kills him with the first 2 punches but he rallies and kills the Humongous (hooray for jet). The rest of the group charge in on the Dirtboot to pick up their comrade and the body of Humongous and drive off spraying the few bullets they have left, Dr. Lucky Boots toasting a few with the rear mounted flamer. The raiders cry outrage and battle begins in earnest. ~40 raiders vs 5 PCs and 6 NPCs.\n\nAt this point I called the session so I could expand the vehicle rules with regard to chases. This would prove very useful in part 2.\n\n",

        "text": " The party:\nMipher: Caitlyn: Vuana the dwarf ranger\n\nJess: Sumac the druid with her companion bear, Cupcake\n\nTratvia:Eric: Valtiri the half-orc sorcerer\n\nEmma: Badb the masked half-elf rogue (pronounced bayve)\n\nMe: Deko the human barbarian\n\nThis story is told from my perspective as I imagined Deko would see \nthings. He has a low intelligence score but his other stats are really good.\nThere may be some things I forget or miss because my character was not there for it. Hope you enjoy anyway.\n\nThe story starts with a split party. We are all low level and members of either the Tratvian or Mipherian armies. Deko is from the Southern tribes which were recently acquired by Tratvia in a hostile takeover. Now they have set their sights on the island nation of Mipher, an independent nation that trades with other nations freely despite having no need. They have no permanent military, only trained citizens and mercenaries. The people have risen up to defend their nation and fight off the Tratvian invaders. Deko has his reasons for joining the military that conquered his homeland and his people but no one ever asks. Perhaps it will come up later.\n\nWhile the Mipher group sits at another table and does their planning, most of which involves fooling around and laughing from what I can tell, the Tratvia group starts in the mess hall of a military camp outside of a Mipherian city. Moments after we sit down to eat, a messenger walks in and says that the commander wishes to see us immediately. As the other two get up, I scarf down my food and follow.\n\nWe arrive at the tent, not far into this campaign, and we start screwing up. Somehow all three of us fail to realize not only that there were other soldiers in the room, but also that they were supposed to accompany us on the mission we were about to go on.The commander proceeded to ask Valtiri if he has had any previous positions as a mission commander. He lies and says he has. He has to roll a bluff check and rolls a natural 20. Of course the commander believes him and puts him in charge. Great.\nHe asks us how many people will be going on this mission. Three. No Valtiri, don't worry about the other guys who were also just told about the mission. We don't need them.\n\nThe Mission: Infiltrate the Mipherian city by finding an underground passage or sewer entrance. Apparently, there used to be some old sewer or underground entrance at the base of the city wall. He gives Valtiri a magic mirror so that we can remain in contact with base camp. We can take what supplies we need and proceed with the mission at nightfall. Due to the fact that he is an idiot, Deko does not require anything other than trail rations, his sword, and his armor. Potions? Healing? Leave that to the weaklings. Meanwhile Valtiri is almost having an excitement overload, trying to get everything he could think of from portable shovels to a wand of detect secret doors. He gets his wish, the wand and a shovel that can be assembled and deconstructed.\n\nDeko wants to walk but the other two want to take a rowboat for the fun of it. They eventually convince him to show off his great strength and row the boat upriver. We are all new to this game and usually roll for things we don't need to. I rolled to row the boat. I rolled a one. Oops. The DM told me to take a 10 on it, so I did.\n\nWe reached the shore upriver and took a look at the map. That was when we realized that the river took us in the wrong direction from where Intelligence had reported there might be the entrance we were looking for. Good work team. We covered the boat to make it look like a pile of debris and trekked across the hills to a patch of heavily wooded area on a hill some distance from the city. The sorceror began to use his wand to try and find a secret entrance. He was having trouble finding anything so he began to search in the trees for something to amuse himself with. Deko noticed a particularly densely wooded area and decide to explore it after I rolled an impressive 24 on perception. He soon finds a large metal grate that looks like it leads down into a tunnel that goes towards the city. He calls his companions over and they start planning how to open the grate.   \n\nThen, the Mipherians ambush us. Apparently, I would have noticed them if I had rolled a 25 on perception. So close. Now we're surrounded, outnumbered at least four to one and I'm thinking that I'm probably the only one that isn't going to die right away. Deko is hard to hit and deals a lot of damage. He also has a high hp. Feeling confident, I draw my sword and prepare for battle.\n\nValtiri roars in an attempt to intimidate our enemies and scare them off. Four of our ambushers nearly wet their pants as they run away. The ones that weren't scared off attack us, taking out Valtiri too quickly for him to do anything more than fire off some acid magic. The dwarf attacks me, rolling a critical strike with a war hammer. She takes out most of my health. I immediately kill Sven, a random Mipherian. At this point I am a little concerned but I still think I will be okay as Valtiri goes down and Badb starts running after having called for help using the magic mirror she had pick-pocketed from Valtiri. Then the bear attacks me and crits me as well. At this point I have hardly any health left and I'm still surrounded by enemies. I look up as fire rains from the sky and takes out the last of my health, knocking me unconscious and causing general havoc. Badb survives a little bit longer but is quickly knocked out. They drag our unconscious bodies away.\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np_5BHmaSI4\n\nThis is one of the most famous single moments in fighting game history, if not in all of professional gaming. It has been the springboard that introduced thousands of fighting game players to their passion. It was my first look at a genre that has redefined my philosophy toward video games as a whole. And it is one of the most masterfully executed plays (both strategically and physically) in the history of professional gaming. \n\nWhat's really amazing about this video is that the circumstances of the moment itself are nothing too special. The tournament it comes from is indeed EVO, the biggest tournament of the year, but this isn't anything like the last match of the grand finals - this is just the winner's bracket semifinals, and it's not even the match point. And yet there is something so amazing, so captivating about it that it inspires the members of the fighting game community to reach out and show this video to as many people as they can. Even though the people they show it to may not completely understand everything that goes on, even though they may never have touched Street Fighter III (or any fighting game, for that matter), the wonder and amazement is too great to be contained. This is how legends are born.\n\nLet's take a look at the competitors.\n\nOn the left side of the screen is Chun-Li, played by the American player Justin Wong. Justin has been and still is a very good Street Fighter player - one of the best. He is known for his flashy and showy style of play - he enjoys setting up elaborate finishing moves and relishes the roar of the crowd. Indeed, arguably his best game is Marvel vs. Capcom 2, a game that rewards stylish combos and well-executed super moves. He is extremely good at these, and he uses the same talents in Street Fighter III that brought him success in Marvel.\n\nOn the right side of the screen is Ken, played by legendary Japanese player Daigo Umehara. Daigo is quite possibly the greatest Street Fighter player of all time - he has won countless tournaments and received endless accolades. He has written books and books have been written about him. He is known for being utterly unemotional when it comes to playing games, for being cold and calculating, and for looking right through a player's face and into their brain - understanding exactly what their next move will be and countering it perfectly. He is known by the Japanese as “Ume,” by the Americans as “Daigo,” and by all as “The Beast.”\n\n**\"Rare footage of Daigo actually angry...\"**\n\nAs the video begins, Daigo's Ken is in a good bit of trouble, and Daigo himself has been put in an uncommon position. Justin Wong has developed a playstyle with Chun-Li where he plays extremely safely, using few moves that present significant weaknesses and maximally punishing the mistakes of his opponents. This style of play requires that his opponent take risks to approach and attack Chun-Li, hoping to catch Justin unprepared and turn the tables against him. “Justin's turtle style” has gotten him quite far in this tournament, to here, in the winner's bracket semifinals. True to the word of the commentator, Seth Killian, Daigo has been forced by Justin to adopt a more aggressive playstyle than he would normally like, and the annoyance of dealing with Justin's ultra-safe Chun-Li is indeed beginning to frustrate him. As the fight continues, Justin manages to persuade Daigo to use unsafe techniques, and punishes them accordingly. The health of Daigo's Ken drops to the point where, for all intents and purposes, he is a dead man walking.\n\nIn most 2D fighting games (as opposed to 3D fighting games such as Tekken and Virtua Fighter), characters have “normal” moves like basic punch and kick attacks, as well as special moves such as Ryu's Hadouken. Street Fighter III also utilizes a Super Combo system, where each player can fill the gauge at the bottom of the screen by attacking his opponent, and then expend its resources to perform “EX Special moves” (techniques similar to a character's special moves, but with improved properties, such as extra hits) or “Super Combos,” flashy, powerful techniques consisting of many hits that do plenty of damage. When a character guards against special moves or Super Combos, they take a small amount of damage despite blocking the technique - this is known as “chip damage.” Daigo has so little health that any special or Super move that connects with him will cause him to be “chipped out,” or knocked out despite defending properly. \n\nWith such low health, the only way that Daigo can avoid being chipped out if Justin attacks with a special or Super move is to “parry” Justin's attack. The standard method of guarding against attacks in 2D fighting games is to hold the control stick away from your opponent's character. This will guard against attacks, but blocking special moves incurs chip damage, as noted above. In Street Fighter III, characters can employ a high-skill, high-risk technique known as “parrying” to guard against an opponent's attack, and do so not only without incurring chip damage but also ending in an ideal position to counter their opponent's attack with one of their own. To parry an attack, you must press the control stick **toward** your opponent, just as the attack makes contact. If you are successful, you will gain an amount of Super meter, will take no damage, and will have a small window of opportunity to attack your opponent while he is temporarily defenceless. But if your timing is incorrect, you are in no position to block the incoming attack since you have pressed the control stick toward your opponent, and it will connect for full damage. High skill, high risk, high reward.\n\nAt this point, the ideal strategy for Justin is to wait and let Daigo come to him -  Daigo will be forced into aggressive play, which Justin has been countering for the entire tournament with his safe gameplay. Additionally, Justin can simply defend and wait for the round's timer to run out - when that happens, the game awards victory to the player with the most remaining health; if you listen to the crowd, you can hear someone yell out to Justin “LET TIME RUN OUT!” Daigo knows that both of these situations are not in his favor. He needs to make Justin go on the offensive, where he can counter him. Daigo knows that despite playing safely as Chun-Li, Justin is a showoff at heart, and wants to finish him off in spectacular fashion. The ideal way for him to do this would be to use a Super Combo. Both players know that Chun-Li's Super Combo activates so quickly that if its target is not already attempting to parry the move when the attack initiates, he will not be able to parry in time and the super will deal full damage. The problem is, Justin doesn't currently have enough Super meter to use his Super Combo. So Daigo decides to give Justin enough rope to hang himself. He throws two EX Hadoukens at Justin - multi-hit projectile attacks. Justin, like the skilled player he is, parries the Hadoukens to gain Super meter and negate the chip damage. Daigo, like the more skilled player he is, knew he would, and wanted him to.\n\nAs the timer counts lower and lower, Justin sits across the screen from Daigo, using a series of normal attacks to distract Daigo and conceal his intentions of using the Super to end the round. Daigo is having none of this, and has already made his play: he walks back and forth in perfect time with Justin, keeping the exact spacing he needs to be able to parry Justin's Super. When Justin activates his Super Combo, Daigo is ready. He has seen this attack hundreds of times from many Chun-Li players. He begins to parry each of the fifteen hits. As the crowd realizes what is happening, they begin to roar and shout, causing a distraction to Daigo, who would ideally like to be able to hear the sound Chun-Li's kicks are making to help his timing. (He and others would, in later tournaments, wear noise-cancelling headphones to guard against this problem.) Daigo knows the pattern of the super's hits - seven kicks, pause, seven kicks, pause, one high kick. As he finishes parrying the last hit of the second set of seven, he decides to parry the final hit in the air: a ridiculously difficult feat that requires perfect timing and is not even necessary - the final hit could be parried on the ground as well. Why go to the trouble, then? Because Daigo is again thinking a step ahead - by parrying Chun-Li's Super, he has earned enough Super meter to use a Super Combo of his own, but to execute that Super, he needs to be able to retaliate in the short window of advantage that he gains by parrying an attack. The best way for him to do this is to combo his Super from a jumping kick, and to do that, he needs to already be in the air when Chun-Li's Super finishes: hence the midair parry. The kick connects, Daigo lands and executes the Super Combo, Chun-Li is knocked out, and a legend is born.\n\n&gt;“For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.”\n\n\\- Raul Julia as M. Bison, **Street Fighter** (The Movie)  \n\n \n&gt;“That's just one of my common techniques, really.” \n\n\\- Daigo Umehara, when asked for comment\n\n",

        "text": "Into I: The Hunt for The Dragon Isles:  Tales of the Brigands of The Western Sea\n\nThe Captain Ramaine sent his first mate, Anale, to collect the ships officers after weeks of unemployed shoreleave in the southern city of Portsmouth.  She found Okeal Steelfarmer, the ship's master gunner, in The Laughing Lich, a local pub frequented by adventurers and merchants alike from the landlocked city-states of the mainland.  He picked up a side job of tracking down a magical gun that was supposedly stolen from his employer by a dwarf.  After tracking him to the tavern, he ordered he and his five dwarven companions enough drinks to loosen their tongues, as well as their packstrings.  They boasted of a pair of magical pistols, and, in exchange for letting them take apart his prized armament, he was allowed to inspect their prize.  Properly liquored, the dwarves never noticed when Okear switched the pistols for two of his own, quickly altering their appearance to match the originals.  While he was apt to continue drinking with the fellows, Anale appearance prompted their swift retreat to find the rest of the officers.\n\nMeanwhile, Lando was holed up in a hidden bar in the cellar of a local in on the seedier side of town, a leftover from a short lived prohibition era of the city.  He had managed to win his way to the final table of an underground gambling tourney, but lost it all to the other finalist, though not before exposing the cards up the cheater's sleeve.  A brawl ensued, and with a quick greasing of a palm and a few well placed words, escaped with Anale and a crate of illicit winnings in tow.\n\nBalthezar Isenhart, the ship's quartermaster, was a known letcher and glutton, though he fancied himself a gourmand as well as a connoisseur of the finer things in life.  Pipeweed, Women, wine, he wanted it all.  Usually at the same time.  This afternoon was no exception.  Anale and the gang found him in the loft of The Lusty Cleric, a middlingly priced brothel known for its laxer than average policies toward use of illicit substances, having an out of body experience, while his body was having an experience of its own.  Unsure of what was reality and what was simply fantasy, he trusted the voice of Anale, at least more than the talking horses and magical pleasure-carriage he was riding in.  It took some doing, but the crew managed to get him dressed with only minor emotional scarring and down the stairs, toward the rest of the crew.\n\nGelvin Buzzgrill, while not technically an officer of the ship, is a valued member of the crew nonetheless.  The ship's cook has spent his shoreleave working for a local noble family as a stand-in when the last chef walked out on them.  Something about no one appreciating the value of animated confectionaries.  The head of the house was a haughty man, who boasted a tongue completely void of taste buds, or so it seemed to Gelvin as the weeks went by.  He complained each meal that the seasoning was too little, that the dishes were bland and tastless, despite Gelvin's ever spicier courses.  Finally, he'd had enough.  Marinating a red dragon sirloin in fire ooze jelly overnight, he added the finishing touches of fire salts and served the dish molten.  He had just enough time to scoop all of the golden dishware and pack up his magical kitchen before the dining room was set ablaze.  He joined Anale and the party on the street outside, and they continued deeper into the city to find the last missing officer of the ship.\n\nEzra, the ship's boatswain, could easily be considered the strangest of the crew, standing a mere 14 foot tall, he's a bit of a runt for a treant.  Sporting a second head betraying his half-ogre heritage, he's grown accustomed to drawing stares in the cities, and tends to spend most of his time in the nearby grove of trees.  Unused to the arid climate, he eventually braves the mass of people to obtain a treatment to soothe his tender bark.  Barely fitting through the door of an alchemists shop's double doors (specifically why he picked this shop, as he can't enter most of them) he's been bargaining hard for a magical ointment.  As an alchemist himself, he's well aware of the running value of any given concoction, and while the shopkeep may have been trying to scalp him, he really did need that cream.  Anale and the crew round the corner into the shop just as he bellows a threat into the tiny face of the alchemist trying to make a living.  He purchased the ointment for it's actual value, but not before ruining the face of the store owner with one of his own expired brews.\n\nThe ship's crew, gathered once again, made their way back to the ship for a briefing on the task at hand.  Ramaine produced a small scrap of parchment, explaining that this was one of many fragments of a magical map, which he then placed in a bowl of water. The crew watched as it floated purposefully to the north.  Ramaine explained that these fragments float toward each other on still water, each fragment floating toward the nearest other, or so the story goes.  He went on to say that for each fragment, they will be paid an ever increasing sum of gold, though he is unsure as to how many pieces exist in the first place.\n\nThe crew were happy to hear that they had another paying job, and morning came fast for the crew of The Angry Orchard, as they set sail north, to fortune and adventure!\n\nTune in next time for more tales of The Hunt for The Dragon Isles!",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I want to tell you all this story because this campaign is going to be coming to an end soon. First though, some lore of the land. Magic is outlawed because it is seen as evil, wizards, sorcerers, anyone that casts arcane magic is taken to a place called the Mage's Tower where they are kept under tight security by a group called The Templars. This is a homebrew class that the DM made and is a very good one at that. Their whole job is to protect people from magic and to keep magic users from escaping the Mage's Tower.\n\nThis portion of the campaign is near the end and was only recently played through. For the past two years Lucas Desiff had been in the Dwarven city with his friends Bernard (Human Templar), Sharp (Dwarf Gunslinger), Doc (Human Cleric), and Jack (Human Sorcerer. We had been hunting a man named Robert that had killed most of Lucas's family and most likely kidnapped his niece.\n\nWe tracked Robert to a place in the Dwarven city called the deep roads, this place was known for bandits and any number of dangers. After days of hunting this man we tracked him to some Dwarven ruins. As we came closer to the ruins we saw that there were some men stationed near the entrance. Sharp set up his double hackbut and prepared to rip these men apart, Lucas pulled out his revolver, Bernard readied is falcata, Jack prepared to cast, and Doc stood back as support. All at once the party charged the men and quickly dispatched them. People from the inside heard the commotion though and quickly ran outside. A man rippling with magical energy and brimming with muscle runs out of the building and quickly begins to attack Bernard. With a combination of bullets and blades all the remaining enemies are dealt with. Inside we went.\n\nAfter walking through the desolate chambers we came across a large door, Robert was surely on the other side of this door, as were several of this strongest men. We burst through the door and lo and behold there he was, Robert, the man that caused so much heartache for this entire group. He was about to be put down.\n\nLucas shot first, firing for Robert, clipping his shoulder while everyone else dealt with the rest of the enemies. After a few rounds of fighting Lucas was grabbed by one of the magical bags of muscle. Being beaten by giant bloody fists everything started to fade. Suddenly, BAM! Sharp fired his double hackbut, nat 20, x4 crit with 2d12+5. The bullet ripped the assailant off of Lucas and killed him on impact. Lucas stood up still dazed by what had just happened. Looking around he saw his allies fighting all around him. Then he saw Robert, firing his hand crossbows at his friends. Lucas wouldn't stand for this anymore. Firing three shots into Robert's back he took him down. Finally after years of searching Robert was no more. The rest of the enemies were quickly mopped up without their leader. Not long after the fight was finished a demon appeared in the room, a familiar sight to Lucas and Bernard, Mattocs. He walked to Robert's limp dead body and lifted him off the ground. Turning to the portal he just entered from we saw a Balor Lord standing on the other side. The hair on the back of our necks stood on end, both in game and out.\n\nMattocs turned to us, \"Thank you for hunting him down for me. I hope to see you again soon Lucas.\"\n\nMattocs turned and gave Robert's lifeless body to the balor and his body was suddenly full of life. Robert looked in horror as the balor began to torture him. Years of hunting, and Lucas could finally sleep at night knowing that the man that took his family from him was gone now. But he couldn't help but feel a pain in his heart as he realized, he was now worse than Robert.\n\nTell me what you guys think. There are plenty of other stories from this campaign if you want to hear them from both the earlier days of Lucas's life to the later ones. Hope you enjoyed the read.",

        "text": "I recently started a new campaign with a group of friends and someone giving DMing his first try. I decided to settle on a melee character who is a member of a group of legal mercenaries called the Messengers. \n\nThis was our first session. So it's a long one as I explained as best I could, even leaving parts out, whilst doing my utmost to make it as entertaining to read as possible.\n\nThe Winter Solstice had once again come around in the calender and the city of Winter, one of the 4 cities of the land forever locked in a state of seasons, was celebrating. The church had 4 new members taking confirmation and attaining the powers bestowed upon adherents used for vanquishing the demons and fell beasts that roamed the countryside at night. The light snow that was the trademark of Winter found itself fighting its way to the ground through the warmth and enjoyment of the festival season.\nLieutenant 'Leftie' Greenvale reported for duty to his superior officer having taken up a contract to stand as additional security for the evenings merriment. He picked up his paperwork and read it thoroughly, taking down by heart his orders which he would follow to the letter, without question, same as always. Leftie could always be counted on to do exactly what was written on the contracts he signed.\n\n\"Break up fights, stand watch for thieves and simply be a warding presence in order to prevent general disorder.\"\n\nThe orders were simple enough. Leftie signed his name, snapped off a salute and left to find a place to survey the crowd that would surely be gathering to see the Confirmation. Whilst on the move Leftie found himself nodding greeting to a considerable amount of familiar faces. Leftie knew everyone, always had. Probably because you don't ignore large, muscled Messengers, especially ones that greet people with a smile and a hug. \n\nIt wasn't long before something suspicious came to the attention of the Lieutenant. A couple of suspect individuals, a child with a fell look and a man who was obviously on narcotics, Or every narcotic. Sometimes it's hard to tell, emerged from a pub and for the brief moment that the thick door was open a scream of pain could be heard. But a lack of pursuit and no cries for help meant Leftie could do nothing but follow and be suspicious.\nOf course, sometimes there are people who do nothing but make the world more interesting and it wasn't long until his pursuers with Leftie in tow came across an accident. A city guard had been pinned down by a falling portcullis in a shock of bad luck but a healer was already attending to him and Leftie simply had to lift the portcullis with the unlikely help of the men he had been following and the city guard was alive and moving. Finding himself surrounded by unlikely and unusual company, the new group made it to the Confirmation. \nThe sad fact about guarding events is that you tend to miss them because you have to watch the crowd, even during the most exciting finales and the most crashing of crescendos the eyes of a guard must scan the populace, looking for likely criminals. \nOn this occasion the Messenger found himself standing outside the exit for the newly Confirmed following the ceremony and as the new acolytes stepped out into their new religiously approved freedom he found himself offering to show one of them the rest of the festival. The priest accepted and Leftie found himself in Company. The kind of Company for whom anything can happen.\n\nThe kind of Company that needs a capital letter.\n\nAfter taking part in the festival games and winning himself a new weapon in the festival brawling competition the Lieutenant and his newfound friends stopped to gather themselves in a spare bit of space in one of the quieter plazas, away from most of the festivities.\nIt was at this point that the band of men found themselves gazing at the sky and happened to see a falling star. Nothing but perfection on this joyous occasion, the new priest found himself praising the heavens for their blessing of this most joyous of days. Of course, he was still under the impression that the blessings of the heavens were ones that were enjoyed from afar. This particular blessing was in the mood for a much more intimate relationship.\nThe meteor rent through the sky, shaking itself to pieces through sheer speed and coating the sky in white hot rocks, like the stars themselves were pulling themselves closer. \nThe meteor fragments slowed greatly in the atmosphere and fell to the earth with relative laxity compared to the speed that they had previously possessed as a whole.\nThis might be a welcome comfort to those who enjoy their astrophysics, but the the continent that was currently experiencing and unexpected rainfall of burning rock, it would have been as much comfort as offering a plaster to the recently beheaded.\nThe rocks shredded the ground and more than some of the fragments fell on Winter itself, striking the ground and tumbling over and over, shattering with each obstacles they encountered and obliterated. Any citizens in the way path of the fragments died swiftly but those who were struck by the flying fragments found themselves pinned the walls and floors. Houses were shredded and the Winter Solstice celebrations ended with screaming and death. \nLeftie and Company found themselves away from much of the desolation but a piece of the meteor had still tumbled its way through to the plaza, knocking over buildings like skittles before shattering and sending fragments of space rock tumbling towards the men. \nOnly Leftie himself was quick enough to find cover, the rest found themselves turned into pincushions of various sizes. It was then that they found themselves doing strange things. The child found himself jumping short distances in space, the drug user found himself talking to a ghost, the healer was knitting together the flesh of the wounded like they had never been hurt and the city guard was on fire, but not burning.\n\nLeftie checked himself for wounds and found the new priest unconscious and badly wounded. Standing up to take stock of the situation he found all previous experience left him with no solution but to stand, jaw agape at what had just happened. Frozen in place and failing to find words leaving him with mouth opening and closing.\nLeftie's superior officer entered the plaza with Messengers in back up to help the wounded and dig out anyone buried. He spied Leftie and came running up. Explaining that he was inside the barracks at the time he had only one question. What had happened?\n\nLeftie turned to look at him, finally coming to terms with what had happened.\n\n'Sir. This lieutenant must report that he has failed in his duties to prevent a general disorder. Sir.'",

Every character mentioned in this story is a real person, no NPCs, just pure human intelligence (and stupidity)*\n\n**Audiolog**: 84-Delta, Narsi.\n\n*The audiolog begins*\n\nIn my time as a Centcomm employee, I never saved as many lives with as little work as during the \"Narsi incident\". For those of you unaware, this incident involved a so called \"Cult of the Old Gods\" summoning a massive space beast to attack the station. I've had some experience with these crazy bastards before, which is a story for another time, so I was sent in undercover.\n\nUnfortunately, the on-station security had failed to stop the cult before it used a ritual to summon the \"Narsi\". Narsi, you see, is a codename for a certain unnatural force known as Cthulhu. Yes, that Cthulhu. This time, Narsi came to this station with four Shoggoths and around a dozen Juggernauts. \n\nIn civvie speak, we were fucked. *(Pauses)*\n\nI dove out of the arrivals shuttle before any of the horrors entered it, and ran into a nearby pod. The launch sequence was in place already, I had 8 minutes to get anyone out of here. Luckily, the cultists had been devoured by their \"god\", so none of them could join my escape.\n\nI sent a radio message out ordering any survivors to my location. By my estimate, roughly 20 survivors were still alive at this moment. The pod can comfortably hold 2. We'd have to pack in like sardines. \n\n3 assistants made their way to the pod first. They were new arrivals, lost on the broken, horror filled station. I quickly stuffed them in the pod. \n\nIt was at this point I'd found out that the other pod had been commandeered by a pair of engineers. They had welded themselves in to keep out the horrors. It didn't go that well. They turned on the pod's radio when the door got breached. We heard their screams as they tried to break the window and suck themselves into space. *(Pauses)* It didn't work.\n\nNow it was our turn to face the Juggernaut. *(Pause)* Words cannot describe the horror the *thing* cast into us. I was prepared to make a final prayer, and hope this damn thing didn't steal my soul. Then it hit me, I realized how to save us all. I cried as loud as my quivering lips could yell \"HAIL CTHULU\".\n\nEven more scared then before, the assistants looked a me with betrayal in their eyes. I whispered, \"Follow my lead.\" They joined my dishonest prayer. Rather confused, the Juggernaut did the horror equivalent of a shrug and went away. *(The narrator begins to get excited)* Fucking beaming, we continued to accrue crew. With 30 seconds left to escape, there were seven of us bullshitting each other about the \"greatness\" of Cthulhu.\n\nThen, a figure fully armored in riot gear opens the doors. Laser gun in hand, he orders us all to stay down. Again, we were afraid for our life. This unknown man could easily slaughter us all.\n\nWhen we got back to the station, our masked man took the helmet off. His face changing into a myriad of shapes. He was a changling, a xenomorph. *(Pauses)* To this day, I have no clue why he didn't kill us. \n\n**END TRANSMISSION**",

I could see him raining hell down on foot soldiers with a slow but powerful quad canon. \n\nKnowing my shields wouldn't stand more than two hits from that canon and my standard issue heavy machine gun wouldn't pierce his shield easily, I decided to play coy and take a couple of pot shots at him from a distance in order to size him up. The rounds connect but immediately he turns, bored with his initial prey and sensing the imminent danger, he fires 4 powerful rockets straight towards me.\n\nI engage my retro thrusters throwing my Titan right, past a building and into the relative safety of a crowded alley, narrowly escaping certain destruction. Creeping slowly I try and outflank my enemy, coming out the other side of my narrow alley I unleash a wave of machine gun fire on his left side and back, hitting a few soft spots and dealing my first dose of damage. However all to quickly I run out of rounds and have to stop to reload. The enemy Titan takes full advantage of his moment of respite and quickly fires again, I push the thrusters again, lurching suddenly left. However the slightest delay in my actions means it was too late and I catch two rockets full to my front. I fumble my reload, losing precious seconds to retaliate. I can see my enemy ready his canon once more and with precious few seconds to attack I lurch forward and releasee my emergency backup. A thick fog erupts from vents over my Titan and moments later it's sparks blue, charged with electricity, simultaneously blinding my foe and eating away at his shields. With my reload complete I step back to reassess the situation, reading myself for the final fight. \n\nHe steps for war out of the smoke and I unleash he'll on him, emptying my clip into the main body of the machine. Flames burst from the body of the Titan, but he's still standing. With no time to reload I unleash the last of my ordinance, firing six shoulder mounted rockets, hoping it will be enough to put him down before it's too late. But he has already reacted putting up a vortex shield catching my rockets before they can meet their target. Knowing there is only seconds before the rockets are flung back at me I throw my Titan right and rush my opponents right flank, wildly throwing a punch in a Hail Mary attempt to put him down. My enemy turns and catches me with my returning rockets inflicting massive damage and sounding countless alarms. Miraculously though my wild haymaker connects, tearing through the compromised armour of the wrecked mecha and reaching in to its body. I violently pull the pilot from his imploding tomb and pull his limp body to my face. He is no longer a threat, despite the grudging respect I feel for him as a worthy adversary I have more than enough of his comrades that are working to end my fight, and with that I throw his lifeless body aside and step into a new battle, damaged but not yet broken. \n\n",

        "text": "The group wearily pushed open the door to The Rusty Spoon, the tavern they were using as a base of operations. It had been a long day. Guldir and Ragthorn had staked out the Fox and Toad, a rather classy establishment up the road from their current lodgings. Guldir was still angry at Ragthorn; the pleasures of drink and a lack of agreement on operational procedure had meant that Guldir had spent several fruitless hours waiting in a back alley for their mark, Inspector Isaac. Meanwhile, Ragthorn had tried to speak with Isaac as he left the tavern, been rebuffed, and had settled for following him back to his residence from a somewhat conspicuous distance as only an inebriated dwarven wizard is wont to do. Rye and Queck were finishing up collaborating their observations of the Inspector’s house with Dunlaid, when the group noticed a rather unusual looking individual in the corner, eyeing off the party. She was a half-elf, wearing what seemed to be pieces of shell. Next to her was a mastiff-sized crab.\n\nGuldir rather grumpily sidled over to Xane, the gnomish bar hand.\n\n“Who’s that?”\n\n“B-b-been waiting for you, apparently. S-s-said she wanted to talk with you,” Xave stuttered back.\n\nWith a nod, the party surrounded the half-elf, who quickly introduced herself.\n\n“I’m Canceria Snips, I work for Grovewarden Wolfeye. This is my crab, Colobous. You can call him Pinchy.”\n\nCanceria had some information about the wizards that were somehow connected to the observatory that Caiora had been slain in. Something about a dark cult, evil spirits, and long-buried secrets. Canceria had followed the wizards back to a business not ten minutes down Augustina hill, a mask shop by the name of The Laughing Knave. They were carrying a body. Canceria offered to help the party, explaining she was after a particular magical item, though she was vague about the details.\n\nThe next day began as usual: preparations. There were prayers to smite the heck out of evil spirits, spells memorised, meditation and physical stretches. Today, following leads was taking a back seat to vengeance. The group travelled the half-hour it took to get to near the top of Augustina hill. They took a left before the summit, avoiding the Opera house and making a beeline for the Observatory of Maximus III. The morning sun shone above them, the view from the hill allowing them to see the sparkling Conerica river beyond the palace to the north. A quick look affirmed what the party already suspected - the wizards that had been here yesterday were long gone, having achieved their nefarious aims and departed. Instead, the two regular guards were posted - stoic defenders of bureaucratic rigorousness. Apparently, they had no memory of having the day off yesterday. Damn those wizards, meddling with the memories of innocent guards!\n\nA plan of attack was decided, basically to retrace their path through the observatory and douse their foe - an evil shadow - in as much holy water as possible. Things were about to get very wet and very scary.\n\nThe party got in to the observatory easily enough, flashing their documentation and entering the main telescope chamber. Entering a chamber where Ragthorn had suffered after breaking an idol of Zon-Kuthon, Canceria proved her usefulness for the first time by immediately identifying a secret door, something Ragthorn had not managed to do earlier despite noting a strange draft in the room. A tiny button in a crack opened the door, which opened with a rumble. \n\n“Hmm. File that one away for later,” was the group’s response. \nTraipsing through the rest of the complex, it was clear the wizards had been in these long-forgotten chambers. Signs of their passage were evident. Most of all, when the party came to reclaim Caiora’s body (and her valuable magic items), they were gone. All that was left was a large puddle of blood. Having reached the final chamber (attributed to a character known as Archon Redgrin), most of the party readied their holy water, while Ragthorn applied a magical force armour upon Rye and got ready to blast with his magical force missiles.\n\nJust as well; for when they rounded the final corner, there were two shadows, not one. They were writhing, two souls, twisted by undead energies, yet fighting even in death. As the first vial of holy water sailed past the strange pair, crashing into the wall behind, the shadows detached and sunk into the floor. A moment later, and combat was joined. The larger of the shadows arose from the floor; Dunlaid attempted to shake his holy vial up, thereby agitating the carbonated liquid and spraying it on the spirit, yet shook it too hard and broke the glass in his hand. The small shadow went straight for the new druid, no doubt feeling that to have a new druid in the party so soon after her death was disrespectful to say the least, especially given their similarities (“Another half-elf druid? Really?”). \n\nAs the force missiles flew and holy water splashed, so did the shadows fight back, sucking the life energy from their victims and weakening their bodies. Yet, as quickly as the battle had begun, so it was over. The greater shadow was banished with a combination of holy dousing and two force missiles to the head, while the smaller shadow was hit by the normally curative powers of the paladin’s hands (though not before the plucky halfling was blasted across the room from an over-concentration of holy energy). \n\nSome say that the only thing that makes you forget the pool of your friend’s blood on the floor is a huge sackful of magic items, and in this case it certainly proved true. In fact, finding the valuable items only provoked the party’s thirst for more loot; acting on intelligence given by Thog Oakencock of the Pilferboots (the city thieves guild), the party surmised that the secret door in the observatory lead to Inspector Isaac’s house. Down dusty staircases and strange wells, through old locked doors and a long winding tunnel, finally the party reached an impasse. It was a trapdoor, locked and barred on the other side of the party.\n\nHandily, Rye managed to convince a gullible cook on the other side to let him in, claiming to be lost. Not-so-handily, Rye was bundled into a pantry and eventually smuggled out of the compound without managing to let the rest of the party in. Yet, through some lucky miracle of fate, the trapdoor was not immediately re-barred. The rest of the party waited until well past nightfall before sneaking in and subduing the lone indoors guard. To put a long story short, they looted the shit out of that place, turning up almost a hundred pounds of gold bullion as well as a tankard that refills itself with ale. The only catch was the party’s plan to ambush Inspector Isaac as he returned home from the Toad and Fox. Instead, they ambushed the Inspector’s wife, returning from one of her nightly sojourns. While they managed to incapacitate the wife and most of the guards, one got away, dodging fireballs and arrows as he ran. It is hard to tell whether that guard is a lucky man or not; Inspector Isaac does not favour servants that fail to protect him or his property. Rueing their impulsive actions yet grinning with glee at their huge score, the party disappeared back whence they came, escaping through the secret tunnel back to the observatory with several sacks full of gold, and a couple of liberated halfling slaves to boot.

        "text": "The Party so Far\n\n* Marc, Human Fighter, (Two handed Axe) with a high Chr.\n* Ayla, Half-Elf Sumouner.\n* Svetlana, Human Fighter (Archer)\n* Ianya, Half-Elf Ranger (Beastmaster) (Archer)\n* Kizmet, Gnomish Rogue (Arcobat)\n\nThe party look at themselves, and both sets are very surprised.\n\n* The Marc in the mirror is not clad in the well-repaired mail of the Town Guard, carrying a chipped two handed axe. This Marc is clad in shining plate, a Kite Shield gripped on his left arm, decorated with a red Axe on a white field, the jewelled head of a Longsword poking from a scabbard laced with silver. A masked helm sits on the desk behind him, as he stands watch over the center of the room.\n \n* This Kizmet is sitting on the desk, a painted scabbard accross his knees, a lyre strung between the backs of his shoulders, dressed in subtle armour, expensively coloured, well appointed. He is dejectfully staring at the book that was once *On Fateless*, it's burnt pages crumbling to ashes beneath his grip.\n\n* The other Ianya is coiled by the window as if she had just entered through it, knees bent, fingers braced against the floor, a crow fluttering in to perch on her shoulder. She is dressed in thick furs, of an animal none of the party can recognise. Her hair is intricately braided, feathers threaded through it to waist height. As she tilts her head forward,  Her tattoos become obvious, blue and green patterns crawling over every inch of skin. In her hand she grasps a longbow, an arrow held between her left fingers, Ianya's Kavomiri knife hanging from a leather Scabbard.\n\n* Ayla is no more, as two figures take her place, a pair of figures dressed in robes of red and blue, heavy tomes hanging from their hips, gloved fingers wrapped around staves with hung with innumerable charms, torn papers and amulets. \n\n* Svetlana accross the Mirror is a resplendent queen, clad in red scale, a gold circlet set with rubies and clear diamonds. A plain swords sits on her left hip, an old longbow set across her back.\n\nIt is, perhaps, only a second before both sides grasp the implication. On 'our' side, Ianya drops the book, letting it fall with a thump as if it had run her through with a lightning bolt, then scrabbles for it again, desperately searching for something, *anything* that she can actually make sense of.\n\nThe remainder on both sides of the mirror take a few rapid steps back, then a few cautious steps forward. On the other side, Svetlana's head, jaw working furiously, snaps towards their Kizmet, whose only response is an annoyed shrug, crumpling another ashed page between his fingers, then waving a hand at this side or the mirror. Another exchange, then Kizmets leans off the desk, snatching at a pack, hurridly pulling out quill and ink. In his haste, the ink-jar goes flying, but Svetlana catches it without a thought and slaps it down on the desk.\n\nThe other Ianya stalks forward, bow held out but no arrow drawn. Her crow is rather more engaged, storming through the air towards the mirror, crashing into it as if it were nothing unusual.\n\nThe Aylas soon fall into a heated debate about... *something,* on occasion stamping down with their staves for emphasis (any attempts to do so on each other's toes were surely accidental, and futile anyway as they both wore armoured boots.)\n\nThat Kizmet had been working hard, scrawling out a sentence writ large on a piece of parchment, advancing towards the mirror with his message held out.\n\nThey don't recognise a word, but the puncuation seems the same. So they return the favour with a great big **?**\n\nThat Kizmet frowns for a second, then retreats, quill flying.\n\nIn the meantime, Ayla has slashed a line accross her palm. To the tune of Ianya's wide eyes and rapidly approaching bandages, she explains she wanted to see the effect it would have on her doubles. None it seemed, unless the effect was lengthening an agrument.\n\nBy now, that Kizmet has again returned to the Mirror, this time with a long list of languages. Some, they recognise: Vargan, obviously. Ianya is fluent in Kavomiri (being one herself.) Kizmet knows a few words of halfling, Svetlana a few of Sindaren, Marc some Sorostran place names.\n\nThe message is returned 'Vargan.'\n\nAt this, that Svetlana spits.\n\n'Why?' From the Mirror.\n\n'We live in Vargan lands.' Comes the reply.\n\n'Are you sworn to Vargo?'\n\nThis is actually a topic of much discussion among the party. Are they? They live on Vargan land; *de jure* the King's, *de facto* the local lord's. (They never bothered to learn his name.) By law they pay tax, and serve in his armies when called upon. Or, at least, they were. By law, they do.\n\nThere is, however much to disagree with Vargo. It is a brutal expansionist power, having annexed the west cities a generation ago, putting them down again not five years before. It breaks treaties when it suits it, uses the slightest infraction of treaties against others as excuse to invade. Slavery, they agree, is abhorrent, none more sure that Ianya, who still remembers the shackles on her once slim wrists. Somewhere with Svetlana trills a nerve that screams at the idea of paying homage to Vargo. Until now, they never had the option of choosing.\n\nThe party decide they are adventurers now, free of bondage and vassalage. The law may say otherwise, but law is written by the lords.\n\nEventually, the answer is returned to the other side.\n\n'We fight for ourselves.'\n\nThey others relax slightly.\n\n'What did you do?'\n\nAt this, the party turns to Ianya. Shrugging would be looked upon poorly right now, wouldn't it?\n\n'Sounded out a word I do not know, for a book I cannot read.'\n\nWhilst that Kizmet is writing the response, this Kizmet walks up to the mirror and pokes a finger at it. No sooner had his fingertip brush the glass he yelped and jumped back, his counterpart the same. Sighing, that Kizmet turned the paper over and started again.\n\nThe Conversation continued on in this slow mannor, as slowly each side built up a picture of the other. By now, Kizmet (drawn by lot) was sent to try and find more paper from inside the tower. He stamps down on the stairs and vanishes.\n\nThat Svetlana, it seems, was a victorious rebel, casting down the last remments of the Vargan Empire, who had fled here into banditry, crowned as Queen of the Bridges in the temple of Gloran. Her rebellion had started from Stornbridge: Soon after inheriting the duchy, she outlawed slavery within it, in direct contravention of the King's law. Attempts to enforce the law (slavery was the bulk of Stornbridge's existance: They filled it's fleshpots, and the slave trade brought merchants there, and the vengeful Kavomiri response brought a strong garrison there as well) led to her removal by a Royal Army, and she fled into the Kavomir forest. Found by a Adventuring party, she escaped back into Vargo, growing rich and powerful under a new face and shaved head in a remarkably short period of time. Soon afterwards, the new King of Vargo, hearing of her great beauty and wealth, sought her out, promising her lands and power should she marry him. This new King was not of the old house, having seized the regency for the infant king, then deposing him in his own stead. Insecure in his rule, loyalists hissing in the wings, He needed an ally with reputation, and fast. In this Svetlana, he thought he had found it.\n\nHe was wrong, very wrong. Instead, she worked with her party, spinning her net wider, secretly garnering lords and ladies to her cause. She promised the west cities the freedom that had once named them. she promised the southern lords an end to slavery. She promised land, wealth, titles and honors, magic items from her own stores.\n\nThen a rumour from the north: Accros the bridges, a new Great Khanata of the Kavomiri arose. And in secret, using Ianya as her women, Svetlana treated with the Khanata: An alliance, to sit her upon the throne, for the end of slavery, the opening of the bridge for trade. At last, it was done.\n\nThen, she convinced the King to take the royal family (although they were without children) to Stornbridge, to tour the fortifications and garriosn.\n\nOf course, by the third night the Queen's men had opened the gate, and the Kavomiri took Stornbridge, and Svetlana slew the King, proclaiming herself Queen of the Bridges.\n\nA bitter war followed, three ways between the followers of the King's brother, between the regent of the disposed king of the last line, and between Svetlana.\n\nSvetlana won, and kept her promises.\n\nPast that, that Svetlana wanted the book, or at least a copy of it. The party, however, were loathe to surrender it, the one thing they had over the others.\n\nTiring of the increasingly bitter discussion, Ianya sounded out another of the five words. No effect.\n\nAnother. this *this,* *this* had an effect.\n\nThey regretted it immediately.",

The victory tastes sweeter this time, less hollow for not having bloodied their blades with human blood.\n\nIt takes them some minutes to orient themselves to the Goblin Map: Their breakthrough emerges when they realise they have it upside down.\n\nStudiously ignoring their collective failure, they lead the horses (+dog) down to the ground proper. There are a few close calls: Svetlana's stumbles and almost falls, the ground giving way beneath her hoof. Nevertheless, transport and persons intact, the party make their way towards the marking, entirely unsure as to what it is they were heading towards.\n\nHaving talked among themselves, they are able to convince each other that it isn't more goblins: The numbers they faced were as reported, and packs of goblins are loud, smelly and prone to pillaging.They was a brief period where the party touched on the possibility of it being buried treasure. Annoyingly, Ianya spoils the fun: Anything the goblins would have to leave behind they would as well. And, if the goblins could have carried it, they would have. The party briefly try to ignore her, but, sadly, reason and logic can only be held at bay so long.\n\nPerhaps some goblin shrine, some holy site? They wouldn't leave treasure just lying around, but as a sacrifice? The idea is tantalising, and is indeed still being discussed when they actually reach what they were searching for.\n\nThe party had, by now, an exquisite picture of what exactly a goblin shrine or temple looked like.\n\nIt looked nothing like this.\n\n*This* was a tower, perhaps twenty forearms high and fifty steps across, without windows, made from stone, a single window on the top third. The top third of the tower rises above the treetops, but not by nature: The keep their distance.\n\nOr perhaps a stone would be a more accurate term: There are no joins, no cracks where grout or cement should lay. The tower looks old: Vines tangle up it's sides, tree roots sneak under it. And yet it looks pristine. Hardly polished, but without any of the normal damage won would expect of something standing for as long as it must have: There are no cracks in the smooth stone that makes it up, and so there is no moss growing on it's wall.\n\nAyla shivers, then Ianya. *Magic* is the word that falls from their lips, one after the other. Again, they tie the horses, with some difficulty: The horses are as flightly as they were when they could smell goblin.\n\nThe party aproach, slowly, eyes peeled for traps and tricks. The tower has a door, as one might expect. Unrotted, with a keyhole, as one might expect from what has been seen so far. As Kizmet reaches down to retreive his picks, he leans a hand on the door, stumbling for just a moment as the door swings in on oiled hinges.\n\nAgain, the party advances slowly, checking for traps so throughly they barely notice the room until they're finished.\n\nThe exterior of the tower may have escaaped the ravages of time and fate. The interior, it seems, has not. An imnumerable array of crates, barrels, shelves, drawers, wardrobes, bundles and baskets, all smashed, empty, rottens. These, most definately, have sworn their fealty to the crushing sands of time, decaying under it's iron hand. Nothing useful is to be had here. It was all ruined, except for several torces, burning too brightly for any wood, burning merrily away without smoke or flicker.\n\nThe staircase leading up is formed from the exterior, it seems, perfectly uniform clean.\n\nKizmet checked for traps, and check he did, and well. Fortunately for his ego, what swooped down on them was not a trap at all, but it was moving fast enough that it might have seemed like one.\n\n*It* was...*It,* neabolous at best, glowing a dirty cream, floating at around chest height. Ayla reacts first, hurling a magic missile at it from her wand, goblins charms still carved in the handle. It was a magic thing: Perhaps magic alone could harm it. It did not exactly react in the wayshe expected, hurling itself towrdds the purple bolt, glowing brighter, growing fatter.\n\nMarc hits it with his act, and that seemed to go much worse for it. The party continues in this vein, *It* hurling magic missiles back, Ayla, relaoding her crossbow, idles as to whether it was always going to use magic missile, or whether it could only use spells previously directed at it. The party implore her not to find out.\n\nEventually, it shrivels, fizzles then disappears, leaving a light ash dusting, a few bits of feather here and there.. Svetlana, and to a lesser exent, Ayla are annoyed at the loss. Ianya, more so (She's the one who knows how to make the damn things....)\n\nThe stairs are reconquered rather more gingerly, opening out into a room full of... Well, the room is mostly empty actually. Scattered furniture corpses in the corners, table and chair legs, tatter fabric scraps, could this quarter have been a kitchen?\n\nThe center of the room is dominated by a giant bird'ls eye view mosiac of a stone spiral staircase,  slab stairs arranged as in a catle tower, allowing the defender's right hand to be kept on the outside. Standing on top of it, Ianya feels sure the stairs are curving up. Looking down, she stamps on the top slab. Perhaps a secret switch?\n\nSadly, she is disappointed. Nothing changes, but now she is sure the the stairs curve down. Maybe it needed a second stamp? No, the stairs curve up again and not much more.\n\nIt's only when she looks up that she realises that everyone is staring at her.\n\n\"Did I grow a second head?\" Is the question Ianya poses.\n\n\"Do that again\" seems to be the only response, half-synchronised.\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\nThis time the response is rather more... confused, the eventual concensus extending little beyond 'that thing you did.'\n\nJust a little confused, Ianya manages to do so. Stamp, mosiac goes down. Stamp, mosiac goes up.\n\nIf anything the party seems more consfused.\n\n\"Why the stares? Have my clothes taken their leave of my body?\" Ianya retorts, subtlelypoking her Cuisse to check that her jest and actually been a jest. As far as she could tell, her clothes remained attached. She could be dealusional, but then she had greater problems.\n\nStill utterly unaware, Ianya allowed herself to be shooed off by Kizmet.\n\n\"It'ls really nothing spe-\" Kizmet stamps his foot on the top step, and disappers without trace.\n\nIanya moves forwards, waves her hands over a spot where Kizmet was, glances down at the mosic: Still going up. She takes a step back, then Kizmet reappears besides her. \n\n\"Come up! Come Up! It's the third level!\" Kizmet exclaims, then stamps again. The party follow suit:\n\nThe third level is have lab, half living, with a four poster bed beginning to rot in the corner, beneath a shuttered window (surely the one the saw from outside?) Tables stacked high with unidentifable equipment, seemingly designed for liquids dot the room.\n\nIn the center of the room lies a desk, surrounding a chair on three sides, a pile of bones lying half on the floor, half on the chair, a book open for the skull, still upright on the chair to read.\n\nAnd then the mirror! A massive mirror, encompassing half of the entire wallspace of the room!\n\nExcept it doesn't seem to be a mirror at all. The room is new, the bed made and fully coloured, the ink at the desk liquid, the quill unrotted.\n\nThe elf sitting on the desk is dead, but recently so it seems: No rot becomes him, his clothes still fresh. They, the party themselves, are completely unpresent in the image.\n\nIanya sloughs the book over, examining it: It seems to be in good shape, with a good binding and spine, dry, unrotted, ink unrun. Holding a hand to keep the place, Ianya slumps the book onto it, angling for a chance at the cover:\n\n**[On] Fateless** written in patient script. Fateless is written in the Vargan form, and the 'on' is a guess: This is Quenya, old elvish, and of the lot of them Ianya could be said to be the best, because she ahs the vaguest idea of how to pronouce it.\n\n\"Fateless?\" Ianya idles out loud. This is one legend she doesn't know, but the others do: Fateless are free of fate, somewhat outside divine agency and control: They hearld the end of ages, death, war, destruction plague and famineIt is said that the Fateless caused the bell-forest and the formation Great Moon Sea, rousing the gods to such great anger that they turned the world's most vibrant forest into a location so terrible that should you loose sight of the bell-line then you are doomed to fate unknowable, even casting a moon down from the heaveans onto the Earth below.\n\nThe first half of the book is laid out like a journal, a header with a date, an, no, it couldn'lt possibly be that far.\n\nMuch is blank: It appears he worked from the edges in, and from the rear the mirror features prominently; Including the page Ianya has a hand wedged in. That pages hosts the mirror, and five Quenya words.\n\nIanya picks one at random, and tries to work her mouth around the word.\n\nIt seems to work, the mirror rippling into gleaming silver, then back again to it's transparancy, if it could be called that.\n\nThis time, the tower is ass ruined as it is now, the bones are bones, and they can see themselves staring back.\n\nExcept not really.",

It's decided that two people will be on watch at any one time, (they don't want to lose the horses.) In all honesty, the party will reach slumber at best.\n\nThe Alcohol is begining to wear off fully, and the gravity of their previous actions begins to creep back in.\n\nTwo hours after Sunset, Marc and Svetlana are up on watch, but neither of them are  making a spectactular job of it. Marc's cleaning his gleeming axehead for the specks of blood they all see, Svetlana digging under her fingernails for the blood she can surely feel.\n\nIt's lucky for the party then that the two goblins that manage to find them have a falling out.\n\nThe two remain quite at first, endevouring to whisper in an attempt at subtlety (but are too fully invested in the arguement to consider moving away from the awake, armed humans first.) Perhaps, had Svetlana and Marc been listening, they might have stood a chance of hearing the slightly less quiet bits.\n\nMarc and Svetlana didn't notice the two goblins and their arguement, even when they escalated to pushing each other, even though that resulted in a snapped twig.\n\nWhat they finally did notice, however, was when crude iron met crude iron the goblins having devolved to the point of muderous anger.\n\nsuch anger swiftly sublmated into blind panic when Svetlana's first arrow struck through the air (really, it was crminal they hadn't spotted the goblins sooner.)\n\nThe remaining goblin could at least feel vindicated: The Gods were obviously on his side: They had struck his opponent down rather than him. He felt rather clever ducking behind a convient root. He'd like to see that Archer get him now!\n\nAs he bled to death a very short time later, he had the consolation that that archer didn'lt get him: It was the burly axeman that got him.\n\nThey dealt with the bodies in the morning, although how much sleep they all got was a matter of a coin-flip. Or, really, they didn't: Just checked them for anything useful (a crude map, nothing compared to the party's local knowledge, but enough to confirm the location of the goblins.) The party left the carcasses for the flies and vultures.\n\nThe goblins were encamped at Smuggler's point. Kizmet knows the way, rather too well for Marc, only recently resigned from his commission with the Town Watch. They'll be thanking him later, Kizmet assures:\n\nSmuggler's point is a large, raised Plateau, with rocky sides with a narrow path up, perhaps just wide enough for two. It's easy enough to get down, Kizmet gives with a half-remembered grin, but rather hard to get up.\n\nThis does little to improve the disposition of the party, who are by now hung over, sleep deprived and still mulling over their first kills.\n\nA probing suggestion by Marc over the possibility of constructing a catapult leads into a full-blown three-way shoutdown between Marc, Ayla and Kizmet, soon widly diverging from the subject of catapults entirely. Ayla seems to be the angriest of them all, but suddenly bursting into tears.\n\nNeedless to say, everyone is extremely grateful for the hapless goblins trying to set traps ahead of them. How the didn't hear the party approach is beyond the collective senses of everyone (their argument having grown loud enough give them a wake of bird flocks at times.) did you get deaf goblins?\n The party continues, some of their excess anger left behind in the cooling corpses in sulking silence. The silence breaks around 4, as Kizmet pulls the party to a halt: The point is before before them, trees felled for a hundred goblins forearms in a ring around the point. The party decides to have Kizmet and Ianya dismont, then scout in opposite directions around the point, meeting on the other side then continuing around, perhaps hoping for a weakness.\n\nNo such weakness is forthcoming. Neither Ianya or Kizmet knew quite what was happening. Marc, Ayla and Svetlana, however, knew exaclt what was happening, as arrows, sling-rocks and.. *other* such things begin to be slung their way from over the rim of the plateau. Svetlana begins to return fire, but has no idea what exactly she is aiming at, while the goblins have no such issue. They retreat further into the forest, annoyed again. Marc dares to mention the catapult again. Ayla slaps him, then collapses into him. Svetlana looks on concerned and confused: Normally, the two were *much* closer.\n\nIn time, the two scouts return, grumpy at their lack of results. Kizmet does, however, spot the rocks in the net hanging over the top of the way up.\n\nThis goes down as quickly as a lead galley. As quickly as tempers allow, a new plan is formed:\n\n* At dusk Kizmet will, as volunteered, disable or dsirupt the operations of the net.\n* As a distraction, the Party will advance at dusk up the path, behind the cover provided by Ayla's Eidolon (enlarged via spellcraft) attacking the encampment, staying grouped up to avoid being overwhelmed.\n\nIt would be unfair to say that anyone was particualry happy with the plan. It was, however, a plan that none of them hated enough to stay out of.\n\nAs the sun performed it's last dance over the edge of the Plateau, Kizmet slips off into the lengthy shadows. Ayla summouned her Eidolon, and the party waits until the sun is just a sliver in the sky.\n\nNow, they advance, and as the Eidolon marches from cover Ayla enlarges it, the party strulling to keep up behind it.\n\nAs they advance up the path, soon enough they are close enough that some archers can take pot-shots at them without the Eidolon in the way. Svetlana and Ianya return the favour with grim annoyence.\n\nAs they near the top, Marc curses Kizmet's name: The net is still in place. But it's too late now, as one of the goblins makes a grab for the axe used to release the rocks-\n\nAnd it slips from his hand, the greased handle flying from hsi reach as it tumbles over the edge of the plateau. Stunned, the goblins take a moment to recover, jumping up to the net itself to try and hack through the ropes with dagger and blade, but it's too late, and Iana just slips onto the Plateau the rocks tumble down behind her, taking the goblins sawing the ropes with them (no one could really accuse goblins os possesing strong common sense.)\n\nBut now they're up, and the battle begins in earnest: The party make their way towards the center of the camp, towards where they believe the chieften to be (the most relatively impressive tent.)\n\nMarc's axe splits left and right, Svetlana flinging out arrows like clockwork, Ianya taking measure shots here and there, Eagles tumbling from Ayla'ls hands, her Eidolon having a whale of a time, smashing, clawing, grabbing and stomping.\n\nInside his tent, the goblin chieften is putting his armour on with the help of his guards. It's when his guards are fastening his spaulders, his arms held out to help them, when Kizmet pops down and stabs him in the throat twice.\n\nWhilst they were off a height, even goblins aren't that stupid, and very soon Kizmet finds himself facing two angry goblins swordsmen.\n\nAt least until the Eidolon tears great gashes in the roof of the tent, swiftly uprooting it. One of the bodyguards makes the mistake of turning to see what's going on: A stab into his lungs soon reminds him of why he shouldn't of. The remaining one snarls, then gurgles, Svetlana's arrow finds his throat.\n\nMarc then rushes in, swiftly beheading the Chieften's corpse, imbedding the leaking head on the handle of his axe, rushing outside with a warcry.\n\nIt'ls at this point the goblins break, scattering to the four winds, arrows and eagles following them as they go. Few make it, and not enough to bother anyone ever again.\n\nThe loot, mearge that it is, is poured over. A wand of magic Missile does to Ayla, some dirty gold pieces divided among the rest. Of most interest is a map, showing the Locale. The symbols are alien, but the locations are not: Here, Forest's edge, the bell line (beyond which it is sucidal to go, although why nobody knows,) the rivers and the general shape of the outer forests.\n\nAsides from one symbol, in a location, really quite nearby, that none of them can puzzle, that no one has ever been to.\n\nBut first, the bodies: Plenty of spare wood, and soon a nice pyre is burning. The horses are brought up from where they were tied (a goblin with a crunched skull lying by the hooves of Ianya's) and the party makes camp ready to investigate in the morning. They are in much higher spirits then previously: Goblins, it seemed, were easier on the soul that humans.\n\nA watch is kept, but the others actually managed to sleep tonight.\n",

        "text": "So when MMOs were in their infancy, players had vastly more freedom than today, whether this was deliberately allowed, or otherwise. These two players illustrate brilliantly in their own ways how absolute power corrupts absolutely. As ever, links are included so you may upvote the authors.\n\n\n____\n\n\nBack in 1996 I played one of the earliest MMOs, Meridian59. During the beta testing period, me and my friends were real assholes; killing, looting (you dropped all your stuff when you died), griefing, just generally being terrible people.\n\nWhen the game went live, I attempted to go legit. I started a character, joined a nice guild, worked my way up the ranks and eventually, when the guild leaders retired, I took over the entire guild. I was honored that they had given me so much trust. That was a great moment.\n\nBut not the best moment...\n\nYou see, there was a money duping bug in game, and an upcoming patch was going to fix it and wipe people's bank accounts. However, if you stored the money at your guild hall (which there were only so many, and my guild happened to have one) you could keep all that ill-gotten money. Our guild stashed all their money, plus some from another guild, in our guild chest. In total, I believe it was about 2 billion schillings (for context, you could easily build up a character with about 300,000 schillings).\n\nThe day of the patch came. I logged in and went to the guild hall. I saw all that money in the chest, and I took it. I fucking took it all. Every penny. I wrote up a quick, sloppy guild resignation, handed the money off to a (thankfully) trusted friend, deleted that character (you could only have one character at the time) and started over.\n\nI used the money to start a crime syndicate. We had a legitimate front as a noob-friendly guild, the Paladins, owned one of the nicer guild halls, brought in some of the nastiest PKers (what we called player killers back then) and looters and unleashed hell on that server.\n\nSay what you will about the morality of it, but it was fucking glorious. For brief period of time I ran a criminal organization within a virtual world with nearly unlimited funds that I stole from my previous, legitimate lifestyle. This is a scenario that simply cannot happen in most MMOs today (well maybe Eve or UO). I've played a good number of MMOs since then but nothing ever topped that. Not bad for one of the first MMOs ever made.\n\n[Noxat - original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1y03nj/what_are_your_best_mmo_memories/cfg6dae)\n\n\n____\n\n\nIt really was an incredible game. You can still play it today, although I doubt it'd be quite as fun as it was at its peak.\n\nOne of my fondest memories in that game was as a justicar. A justicar is voted in and his role is essentially to turn orange (criminal) and red (murderer) colored people back to white (innocent). When an innocent hits another innocent (or harms them in some way), they turn orange. When an innocent or a criminal kills an innocent, they turn red.\n\nAnyway as a justicar I got to be the one guy on the whole server that decides which criminals and murderers get to become innocent again. But of course, the whole thing is a racket. My guildmates want me to turn them innocent and other people just flat out bribed me (successfully, usually). I was about 14 or 15 years old at the time and I wanted to dabble in not being a goody goody. And man, it was good times.\n\nUntil I got bored and decided to turncoat on my guildmates. I let the enemy guild into our guildhall and let them ransack the place. To make a long story short, I wound up spiraling out of control and became a PKer (player killer), which was fun for awhile. You log on, people see you and begin broadcasting to the server your location and it becomes a little game of cat and mouse. But then I found myself running out of reagents for spells, and resorted to killing newbies for whatever loot they happened to have on them. At some point I decided to reflect and I was forced to ask myself, \"what am I doing here?\" A once proud justicar turned murderer.\n\nSo, I skipped on over to another server and started up a guild, but that's another story.\n\nI second Noxat, of all that MMO's I've ever played, there's just nothing even close to being that immersive and personal.\n\n[runtheplacered - original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1y03nj/what_are_your_best_mmo_memories/cfgj3jd)",

One the other, eleven people are dead, that perhaps need not have been. The members of the party stare at their hands, dusting off imaginary specks of blood, sit silent at camp, huddled around the fire.\n\nBack in Forest's Edge, their rightful reward granted to them for eleven blooded ears, the party resolve to get drunk. very drunk. Hell, they're rich now, compared to everyone around them\n\nSo they try the Black Brew. It tastes of Iron, kicks like a warhorse, will knock you on your arse in a few drops. Or so they've been told: They've never had the chance to try.\n\nThree Mugs downed without spitting, pissing, vomiting, shitting or falling over while standing on a raised platform, and you get your money back, with a minute between each mug. Pay upfront. They begin their quest to the rapt attention and the mug drumbeat of the entire Tavern, whispered bets humming throughout the crowd.\n\nAyla and Svetlana fall at the first hurdle, barely emptying their mugs before staggering off into the crowd.\n\nOn the Second Round, the Ianya and, to the great dismay of many (and the smug delight of a few) Marc fail the test, Marc's fall cushioned by a conveniently placed patron. He doesn't mind, however: He's just made quite the windfall.\n\nNow, only Kizmet remains, huge Spike of Green hair rising above the crowd. He downs a quarter, a third, half, two thirds, three quarters!\n\nThen the Second Mug properly hits him, and he promptly swans off elsewhere.\n\nNone of them remember much after that.\n\nThe party wake in the oddest of places: Ayla and Marc wake together (hardly suprising,) naked (far less suprising than it sed to be) in the Guard Captain's office (very surprising.) As a matter of fact, he's just arrived for work.\n\nIn a few minutes, two two guardsmen tittering and listening at the door are knocked aside by said door, then a pair of only half-dressed, blearly eyed adventurers, wel-worn berations working themselves down the corridor behind them.\n\nSvetlana awakes on top of the Tavern, clothed entirely except for her boots.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, Kizmet has them, or at the very least knows who they are, although what he's doing in the Tavern fireplace (luckily, unlit) is beyond... well, everyone. He is also supiciously heavy.\n\nIanya awakes covered in ash. Soon, it's damp. *Returning here was a mistake.*\n\nThe part managed to reconvene around three. They could have done so earlier, but Svetlana had yet to work the location of her boots out of Kizmet, who had been far busier returning people's coinpurses.\n\nThey're all at least slightly drunk (erring on the side of moderate) and are quite recovered from their earilier ideal. They decide to continue on their quest, now aimed solidly at the goblins in the area.\n\nBut first, the party buy horses, riding ones (or in one case, a dog.) It may be a forest, but 20 or so gobins would stick to trials or make their own. Besides, there wouldn't be another Horse Trade in town for a year at the very least.\n\nThey make their way off, sun hanging low above the trees. Ianya knows a good spot for a camp: A cave shelteredy an overhang, near a brook for water.\n\nThe forest is... quieter. The birds whisper, the leaves tremble rather than whistle. They could swear they've spotted eyes now and then.\n\nIt's a good thing Kizmet's on a dog: Close to the ground, he can spot the traps: crudely made with poor Iron, nevertheless it would have broken a horse's leg.\n\nfinally, the party make camp, deciding on a short watch each, although none of them are sure they'll get any sleep.\n\nThey're on the right trail. But so are the Goblins.",

        "text": "This happened a long time ago back when I was just entering 7th grade (I think? not sure on the date or my age) I had started a trial version for the MMO Star Wars Galaxies. This story happened on the second to last day of my trial, and it was probably one of the greatest things to happen to me in an online game.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm only going off of what I remember, so some parts *may* be wrong.\n\nNow in Galaxies (or at least the trial version not sure about the real thing) you started out on Tansarii Point Station. With the only other place you can go being a place called Station Gamma. Station Gamma is a space station built inside an asteroid and is home to centaur like aliens, called [Sepulcher Venomstrikers](http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080224163819/starwars/images/thumb/0/0a/SepulcherVenomstriker.png/581px-SepulcherVenomstriker.png) (Had to do some searching for that thing). But that's not the only thing occupying the station, there was also a group of (hostile) aliens called The Rak'qua that looked to be from the same race as the [Jedi Kit Fisto.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kit_Fisto) I usually kept to the beginning part of the station, and it wasn't until the day before this event that I had actually attempted fighting the Venomstrikers (They freaked younger me out a lot). \n\nThat's enough backstory, time for the main event. \n\nTwo friends and I decide to try and get by the strikers and see what lies deeper in the station. We got some other people to join us and had a pretty decent sized group. We made our way to the strikers and managed to get past all of them no problem. We soon came to a large room filled with Rak'qua, including their leader at the upper most part of the room. We take them all out with little trouble.\n\nIt was after we killed everything that we found a doorway under the stairs. We went in and entered a large cave. It was here that we met [Ageaughu, The Overlords Pet.](http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080224163418/starwars/images/3/3d/Ageaughu.png) Everyone immediately attacks it, and after a while we take it down. We celebrate, and a couple of guys leave us to head back to Tansarii. Those of us remaining get the bright idea to use this guy to grind. \n\nThe second fight started off rather well, but then things started to go bad. We lost a guy, and, thinking we could finish him off on our own continued on. Soon we were all pretty low on health cause this guy hits hard. We decide to pull back to the tunnel where he can't hit us and recharge our health.\n\nAs soon as I enter the tunnel I see the walls begin to move. I quickly open the chat and type one word: \"RUN\".\n\nWe run out of the tunnel only to meet up with the now respawned Rak'qua. I book it for the exit and turn around in time to see Ageaughu poke his head out of the wall and proceed to free himself of his prison. That SoB had clipped through the wall, was now loose in the station, and was out for blood. Fearing for my life I ran the hell out of there, past the Strikers and everything else on the way.\n\nThere was only one other survivor with me by the time we reached the transport off that station. \n\n\n**TL;DR**: Giant boss monster glitched through a wall and went on a rampage in the map.",

        "text": "The party at the very start of the Campaign:\n\n* Marc, Human Fighter, (Two handed Axe) with a high Chr.\n* Ayla, Half-Elf Sumouner.\n* Svetlana, Human Fighter (Archer)\n* Ianya, Half-Elf Ranger (Beastmaster) (Archer)\n* Kizmet, Gnomish Rogue (Arcobat)\n\nIt's a dark night when Elus dies. The party falls into mourning, but Ianya, his adopted daughter, the girl he freed with gold from a slaving party before she ended up in a Stornbridge brothel at the age of twelve. She's 24 now, but she mourned him long ago, watching him die over a period of months before her very eyes. It'ls almost a relief when his ashes are scattered to the wind.\n\nThe five had agreed to leave years ago, when they first decided that they couldn'lt stay here, in Forest's Edge, but they waited for Ianya because that's what friends did.\n\nNow he's gone, and Ianya burns his house to the ground after she's retreived his bow, his axe and his buckler. Then, she weeps.\n\nAll adventurers need a start, and a band of goblins and a dozen bandits seem like a start. The party votes for the bandits first.\n\nThey spend the good part of a day tracking them down to an old tomb, bones long since picked.The party readies, 2 bows, one crossbow, a meaty axe and two shining daggers, Ayla's Eidolon whistling in the wind.\n\nNo bandits on watch. Marc, Kizmet and the Eidolon move forward. Kizmet spies the chains, but too late, and then the three ghouls recoil from their buried positions, leaping up to meet the intruders. The three Forwards find themselves entangled, the rear line throwing off shots when they dare.\n\nAyla Pulls Eagles from the eather, casting them into the fray. This causes one of the Ghouls to break off, throwing itself towards her, brought down in the last metre filled full of arrows. She then collapses as if punched straight through the Stomach, her Eidolon keeping itself material by shifting the burden onto her.\n\nSuddenly, Kizmet'ls luck fails him, the ghoul's claws raking across his back, the poison stiffening his muscles until he falls.suddenly, one of the bandt charges up from inside the tomb, Marc breaking off to hold the entrance, the Eidolon working on the Ghoul.\n\nIanya hurls herself forward distablising the Ghoul at the last second, her father's Buckler taking great gashes, the wood perforated in two places. But it's enough, and Kizmet's daggers find themselves in the back of it's knees, then it's neck. Svetlana's arrows finally bring the last Ghoul down.\n\nMarc bests the Bandit, sending the corpse rolling down the stairs again. The party rushes forward to the entrance, Ayla exchanging spells with her Eidolon [Life conduit and Rejuvenate Eidolon.]\n\nThey've discussed this on the way. Eidolon restored,  Ayla enlarges it, ordering it down the stairs. It complies eagerly, chasing down into the dark. 20 seconds, 30, then Ayla gasps and collapses again as itls cast back to it's own plane.\n\nPlan B) Charge. The stairs last only 10 seconds or so, and the three wounded bandits prove no match. They join their three already dead comrades.\n\n3 and 3 is six. 6 is not twelve. Half of the group is missing. Ianya states that twelve pairs of tracks led here. Checking outside again, she remarks on several pairs of twleve boots out, then twleve boots in, except for a fresh pair of twelve boots out.\n\nThe party votes, and decides to bury the dead, and wait. Marc thought to bring a shovel, Svetlana says the prayers over their shallow graves, but not before their left ears are removed*. The Ghouls are stuffed back into their holes, chains carefully replaced.\n\nThe wait is on.\n\nIt's Kizmet's turn on the roof on watch when the other six bandits start returning. A single bowshot later, he's swept back inside the tomb, fully rousing the others from their near stupor (It's their first taste of death in anger, and they'lre disturbed to admit that they don't feel as dirty as they though they would.)\n\nIn any case, the party takes up positions at the bottom of the stairs, except for Kizmet, perched on a gargoyle just inside the stairs, hidden in the dark but not before sprinkling a layer of Caltrops at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nThe bandits reach the top, two bowmen, four swordsmen charging down, one with a broadsword, dressed in mail. Two arrows fly up at them from Svetlana and Ianya, hit, miss. Two arrows in reply, one scraping the flesh of Ianya's side. Kizmet joins the fray, sending an arrow into one of the bowmen.\n\nIt's no longer the caltrops the swordsmen are concerned about, as Ayla casts grease on the stairs before the bottom. Three of them grind to a halt, the fourth slipping, head dashed against the stairs, sword falling from his grasp, never to return.\n\nThe remaining swordmen begin to make their slow way down the greased stairs, protected somewhat from arrows and Svetlana and Ianya duel with their counterparts.\n\nKizmet is forced to hug his Gargoyle tight, as the two bowmen seek his end first. Luck seems to be laughing at Ianya and Svetlana, their shots wide or digging into leather rather than flesh.\n\nThe first bandit to make it down soon regrets it, but not for long as Marc's axe ends him, only one swordsman left, along with the mailed broadswordsman.\n\nIanya and Svetlana finally find their mark, their targets dropping at last. The mailed one is almost at the bottom, then Svetlana's arrow finds the weakspot at his knee, and he collapses forward, throwing out his hands to save his skull, Caltrops puncturing his shoulder links.\n\n\"Surrender\" Marc commands, Axe held to the neck of his spine.\n\n\"Kill me now or hang me there!\" The Bandit responds, hands groping towards his belt.\n\nMarc chooses here, the remaining bandit fleeing upwards, casting his sword aside. Marc mutters that he should have kept it, to beat into a ploughshare.\n\nThe shallow grave is expanded, prayers given again, ears kept again*, prayers echoing in the party's ears from the last two time they've heard them this week.\n\nThey head off, back to town. The goblins will keep, and they need some time to think.",

All his spells were muscle 'themed'.)\n\nThey were out in the ruins of Osirian looking into the rumors of a \"lost Pharoh\"'s tomb. What they discovered was a massive underground complex and Pyramid structure. The entrance was filled with traps and psychotropic fungus. Loads of fun when the PC's started to halucinate! A few hours later they decend into the main entrance and loose one of their party to a Div and massive clockwork guardians. Worse, in their retreat the Gunslinger/Monk's body was dragged away into the complex!\n\nThe party fights their way inside to discover: A moving presentation! Much like a Disney ride from hell it has viewing rooms where they see bodies disceted, filled with mechanical parts, reanimated from magical elixers, and then put on display for bidding for the 'guests'. Worse yet, the Gunslinger is one of the new drones!\n\nAnd these zombies, they're not just clockwork undead. They have buglike paracites that eat out the brains and control the animated flesh. So they're full on invasion of the body snatchers meets terminator going on.\n\nThe PC's pretend to be a buyer and bid on a group of zombies winning a set of 50, including their friend. They even get a control rod for them. Then they are presented with a massive arena so they can test out their wares. It's here they meet a pole fighter captured for sport, they 'free' him by asking the hosts and add him to the party. (new PC character)\n\nBtw, if I forgot to mention their 'hosts' are more zombies, but these are Mentants with massive bulging bugbrains. The smart caster ones who maintain the business and factory for their master...who died ages ago but they kept on making zombies like business was just fine.\n\nAfter having a minute to take it all in they get to work. They capture a worker clockwork (pure machine) drone and 'break it' in interesting ways. It starts acting like a dog fetching things for them. They use it's broken programing disks to infect the factories main systems. They discover a team from Cheliax has also entered the factory and is negotiating for an army!\n\nThen they \"Cheeze it!\". They order the 50 zombies to excuse themselves and flee to the exit. They PC's start a running fight trying to find a way out. \n\nImagine 50 zombies all saying. \"Pardon us, thank you for your time, we must be going now.\" as they run past other zomibes and mentats in the facility as the PC's use the distraction to get away.\n\nDuring this time the \"Priest\" reconfigured the broken drone as a compation and put the gunslinger's gun in it's hands. It became \"Fido\" and followed him around shooting at those he said to shoot at. The group found a massive series of carts and had to fight a series of balistas to claim one of their own. \n\nThen as they jumped into a rail system that lead ot the surface they were attacked by a massive Mecha Spynx being piloted by an agent of Cheliax. What followed was right out of a video game. The PC's figting by jumping from mine cart to mine cart, throwing explosives, magic, and sadly the Fist Fighter at the mecha. (The fighter was ground to a pulp by falling under it's wheels.) \n\nEven worse the machine lauched a (unfortunatlly badly drawn) flying machine that fired bullets at them. Dubbed the Helicocktur by the players to my pain, they finally dropped it by summoning an Air elemental. After disabling one of the main engines on the Spynix their cart pulled away to safety. 2 PC's dead...or undead. And a mystery to solve for later.\n\nLater sessions would have them fighting a HellKnight on a Flying Robot Unicorn!\n\nHave fun kids!",

        "text": "At the end of our previous session, our intrepid adventuring party (all with five levels)\n\n* Ianya, Half Elf Ranger (Beastmaster) without Animal Companion as of yet.\n* Svetlana, Human Fighter/Paladin (4/1) (Archer)\n* Kizmet, Gnomish Rogue (Acrobat)\n* Asuryan, Human Cleric (NPC)\n\nHad managed to infiltrate five levels (out of seven) into a Formian hive, in order to rescue some Dragon Eggs (for a dragon which is very much alive.) However, our luck failed us, and we walked into a Formian Champion. A gruelling fight ensured, with us eventually emerging victorious, but only with the expenditure of almost all magic and mundane healing. (Two spells left in the Cleric-bot.)\n\n[Meta: I was allowed to re-jig Ianya at this point, moving from 1d8+1 longbow damage to 1d8+7. Much better.)]\n\nAt this point, we are caked in Champion blood. No doubt, we are irridating massive amounts of 'kill this, kill it now' pheromones.\n\nWe are on level five, the nursery level. After a successful knowledge check, we remember that the Royal jelly they use to feed the larvae holds a powerful 'neutral' scent.\n\nAs such, we hurry there as quickly as sneakily possible. We arrive at the Nursery from a raised entrance (not stepping in because we're not stupid.)\n\nWorkers. Workers everywhere. Big Shallow bowls of larvae, constant stream of workers carrying royal jelly back and forth in massive pots, All watched over by a spindly overseer with compound eyes. Different secretions appear to be added to different bowls, perhaps for forming different types?\n\nThe plan is simple: Kizmet uses his gauntlets (Holding spikes on the end of chains) to drop into one of the pots from the ceiling, collects as much as possible, uses gauntlets to get back. If the Overseer sees him, Ianya and Svetlana fill it full.\n\nKizmet just passes the Stealth check to avoid the Overseer, suceeds the Acrobatic check handily, lands with a plop into one of the pots., coating himself in the stuff, and he quickly scoops some into a sack.\n\nThe confuses the worker carrying the pot quite a bit. As we find out, Kizmet now exists on the pheromone spectrum, as a peice of scenery. In the Royal Jelly.\n\nThe worker, annoyed (if such a  bas creature could be annoyed) sets down the pot, pulls him out and drops him (remember, neutral, might as well be a rock.)\n\nThis, however, halts the flow of Jelly, and the Overseer starts scrabbling over. Kizmet, trying not to make eye contact with his rapidly approaching doom, scrabbles behind one of the works, keeping the pot between him and the Overseer. It was a good stealth roll, but nothing compared to what the Overseer rolled...\n\nA one. The Overseer, fancying a snack, eats the offending worker, *pour encourager les autres.* Kizmet rapidly scrambles away from the Overseer, risking scraping some more Jelly (this time refined with secretions) from one of the Bowls.\n\nHe decides he's risked enough, rolls acrobatics to get up to the ceiling again. Rolls a 3!\n\nBut never fear! He's an Acrobat, and can re-roll a failed Acrobatics check once a day. 17! He's free and clear.\n\nBack at the entrance, we all smear ourselves in the stuff. Think Petroleum Jelly. Kizmet's massive spike of Green hair is ruined. He's mortified.\n\nHowever, we can continue down.\n\nLevel 6? Queen's chambers. Sneaking across a main tunnel, we spy hastily assembled barricades. We were given the side-goal of killing the queen, but we know we can't. We're still half dead from the Champion, although taking a Jelly Bath has done wonders for Kizmet.\n\nWe've still got some left, and it's at this point Ianya recommends keeping some back for the Dragon Eggs, in case the Formians marked them with a 'do not let this leave the hive' pheromone.\n\nOh, you should have seen the GM's face. Glorious...\n\n**More Follows!**\n\nWe make it to level 7, not fluffing our Survival/Stealth Rolls (which resulted in the aforementioned Champion bout.) Level 7 is weird, unordered, unplanned, very... Unformian.\n\nKizmet pulls out a stick of chalk, and we make rolls on Perception/Survival to help find the Dragon Eggs. Ianya and Svetlana both roll in the 15-20 range. Kizmet rolls a 1.\n\nSeveral Hours Pass...\n\nHaving ascertained the tunnels are empty (by accident) and returning to where we started, we roll again. This time there are no fluffs.\n\nWe find a large chamber, entered by a shallow slide. We go down... and Run into 3 [Violet Fungi.](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/fungus-violet) They Poof up, the poison poofs out, lingers, and Ianya's stunned for 1 round and Svetlana for 2. Kizmet and Asuryan advance, then swiftly regret it when Kizmet fails fortitude saves and looses 1d4 CON and STR. However, before he retreats Kizmet throws a bottle of Alchemist's Fire on the nearest: 6 damage. This detonates the remaining poison in the air, dealing 11 damage to the Fungi. The party make their Reflex saves, so we only take 6 damage, and Kizmet (Rogue that he is) takes none.\n\nThe other Fungi lash out at the Archers, and Ianya makes her Fortitude Save by the skin of her teeth.\n\nNew Round, and Ianya (who was supposed to be top of the order) springs into action, slinging an arrow into the fire damaged Fungus. She hits, and rolls an 8, for 15 damage [meta: Last session, this would have been 9. Kudos to the GM for allowing the Re-jig.] The Fungus deflates like a burst bladder.\n\nIt's Kizmet's round, and he pulls out of short range and throws a pair of daggers, a hit and a miss. Asuryan throws her Spear (Holy weapon yeah!) And it pops the Second. The last makes another successful lash for Ianya, but she makes her saving throw by a whisker for the second time, avoiding the Stat Damage.\n\nIanya misses her shot on the last, and then Svetlana bursts into action, dazed no longer. Two Arrows arc through the air, piercing and popping the last fungus.\n\nLast healing spells expended, we explore where we've ended up. It's empty, for the most part, withering violet Hyphae caking the floor of the room. But at the other end is the front... third of a ship, or close enough. Bizarrely, it's too large to fit in the doorway, left alone be carried through the hive itself. The party chalks it down to 'the Planes' and checks for traps.\n\nWe examine the ship closer. It's in relatively good shape, given that it looks to have been here a while. It's got no keel, and flat bottomed. Hardly useful for going on water. Examining the figurehead (an armoured women with a spear stretching forward underneath the bowsprit, arching her back as to leave a gap between the two) reveals thousands of tiny, intricate runes, unidentifiable in content, but the script looks to be from a Necromancy back on the Home continent (we're on a different continent from what we started on. Long story.) The Boswprit, as well, is strange: It's points straight forward, whereas they're usually angled up to hang a sail from.\n\nPuzzled, we move into the Ship's hold through the virtue of the fact it's lacking a back. We find five chests inside, all locked. Kizmet practically cackles with glee, fishes out his picks. The First contained books of some sort, the ink long run and the paper long rotten. The Second, a banner, a gold rampant horse on a green field, that Svetlana vaguely recognises to be from one of the many, many small republics and kingdoms in an area the rest vaguely understand as 'South of here.'\n\nThe third contains a map. Kizmet pulls it out, looks at it, frowns. It's hardly useful as a map: It's only showing places he knows of. He passes it off to Ianya, who remarks that it only shows places that *she* knows off, including the great forests in which she lived the first twelve years of her life. Intrigued, Kizmet pads over: And as he peeks over, the map re-arranges to add the places that Kizmet knows but Ianya doesn't. They both agree that it's valuable, and stash it.\n\nThe fourth requires some more time, until Kizmet remembers what kind of lock it's using. Inside is a mail shirt, medium size, magic. Asuryan identifies it as 'Mist Mail:' Wore as if weightless, magically enhanced protection, can utilise mist and fog to aid the wearer in combat [Meta: +2 mail with No Armour check/Dex max, and a +2 Attack/damage in mist &amp; fog.]\n\nThe party concurs that Ianya should be the won to have it: She had missed some lucrative adventures fruitlessly tracking a slaver that their doppelgängers were aiming for. Kizmet's eyes very firmly averted (with the kind help of Svetlana and Asuryan,) Ianya replaces her leathers cuirass with the mail.\n\nIt's not Mist Mail at all: It's Cradle Robber's Gift, and a fluffed Will check leaves Ianya a fey half-elf. She keeps her silence. [Meta: Still +2, still no dex max/armour check, and a +1 to attack/damage cumulative for each attack she misses until she hits.]\n\nThe last chest almost spikes Kizmet with a needle, his fingers pulled away at the last second. Remaining a bit more cautious, he disable the trap, opens the chest:\n\nFour Dragon Eggs. What we came for. Ianya rushes forwards to help Kizmet place the Eggs in their holders (provided by our benefactor for this quest, a different dragon and her human lover.) Ianya calls for quiet as she holds one of the Eggs.\n\nIn the silence, the tiny sounds are clear: These are nearly hatched. Hurriedly as carefulness will allow, Ianya and Svetlana place the Egg's in a sack, smeared with the remaining Royal Jelly, kept fresh with a gem of preservation, which is then placed with the eggs in a sack, carried by Svetlana.\n\nBefore we leave, Kizmet casts another over the Figurehead, particularly the gap between Figurehead and Ship. Spying something, the gnome can't resist, and leaps up onto the Figurehead's back. Spying a concealed panel, he pries it open.\n\nThe party, all blessed with low light vision, either by birth or by magic, are suddenly blasted as a blue light stems from the open panel. The light dims, or they get used to it, and Kizmet examines further: A blue gem, floating, soft lightning emanating every so often from it into the inside of the figurehead.\n\nHe grabs it. Of course he grabs it.\n\nThe ship arcs upwards and forwards as if given a great kick, colliding with the wall of the chamber. The ship doesn't seem too badly damaged, the wall more so. Kizmet was thrown clear, and landed perfectly, still clutch the  gem.\n\nThe party takes this opportunity to bloody leg it.\n\nUp to level 6, 5, 4. The game is up, as more and more Formians take up the chase. On level four, two soldiers have to be cut down by the party.\n\nLevel 3, 2, 1. The end in sight, last drops of sunlight echoing down the tunnel. Just 100 ft... But now with the Horde behind them.\n\n*This was where Kizmet's player had to leave. Session ended here. It was fucking awesome. Next session isn't for two, three weeks.**",

        "text": "A long journey, one of much bloodshed, tears, pain, and death, is almost at is end. A party of a Fighter, Barbarian, Cleric and his bard(level 1), Sorcerer(myself), and Rogue stand in a throne room. Before them, Three Giants, and a girl. A girl clad in golden armor, with the Sword of Greed. Behind them, a portal, leading to Karzoug himself, the greatest threat to the world. We've prepared, fought long and hard to get here. The only thing standing between us and him is one last fight.\n\nShe opens in a charge, quickly closing the distance between her and the party. Her target, the Cleric. \"Go for the giants, we'll handle the girl\" was shouted. The fighter and barbarian charge forward, the rogue vanishes to the shadows. The cleric readied his shield to face her, as I stood near to support. The giants did not put up much of a fight in the back of the room, although killing them proved time consuming for the two warriors and the shadowy sniper.\n\nAt the front, the girl and the cleric fought hard, the sound of their blades filled the room. She tried to push on myself several times, only to be stopped by the cleric, forcing me to back away from the two, supporting from a distance. Her spell resistance was high, and I could do little to help the cleric. He held his ground for as long as he could, but two crit later, he fell. The girl looked up at me, blood dripping from her blade. \n\nI was next. It would take too long for the fighter or barbarian to make it, and I wouldn't be able to hold out against her. Suddenly, the Bard, the little one who most forgot he was around, the one who stood no chance holding her off, threw himself onto the cleric, carrying out his last orders... \"If anything should happen to me...\"\n\nA bright flash engulfed them both, a scream from the girl was barely heard over the blast. The bard had done it. He set off a bag of holding filled with explosives. She never stood a chance, the flame erased her from existence.",

        "text": "Note: there is no magic in this world outside of elementals and even then it is extremely limited.\n\nIn the year 427 3E on an Evenfast afternoon, Toric Yalmas ascended to the position of High Command in the Triune alongside Taela Haeverwest and Gregor Hellquist, the High Economist and Head Scientist respectively. Toric Yalmas was relatively unknown before his seat of power was obtained and many investigators scoured his history and rise to power. Unable or unwilling to find anything incriminating, Torik retained his seat at High Command.\n\nUsing his influence, he set laws into motion that restricted the ability of humans to find work and operate businesses, so that the upper class elementals could make further profit and expand into the vast market vacuum created.\n\nUnable to find work, humans either starved or turned to crime, stealing and robbing just to eat. At this time, shadowy figures began appearing, sparking rebellion against the corrupt military government and in response a pulsing wave of marshal law burst from the capital, restricting travel to and from every city it reached.\n\n*****\n\nWhen Lim Lee stepped off the airship, the AS Talbott, he was greeted by angry, hard faces and a thundering train overhead. Shopkeepers wrung their hands while they scoured the streets for prospective customers. Children looked from windows, unable to go out and play and retinues of armoured guards, their repeater crossbows slung in the holsters, marched along the streets.\n\nLim Lee turned to a tinker named Sergio, whom he had befriended on the voyage. \"I think the war has finally caught up to us. This city seems to be under military occupation.\" Another group of guards marched past, giving him and his olive skin a distrustful glare.\n\n\"I need to get my currency swapped out. My Bhat isn't worth anything outside the Yushan Provinces.\" He scanned the streets, looking for anyone that wasn't pointedly ignoring them.\n\nJust then, a man stumbled out the front steps of a tavern, with angry words following him and a half-clothed woman cowering behind the source. The man on the ground held up the bottle in his hand and took a huge gulp before stumbling to his feet. A glass cup cracked off his forehead and he reeled before retreating away from the barkeep's barrage of insults and glass missiles.\n\nLim Lee and Sergio glanced at each other before approaching the man. Sergio spoke up first, \"Do you know of a bank or money exchange where my friend here can trade in his Bhat at a decent rate?\"\n\n\"Do people introduce themselves where you come from or is that just the thing around here? The name's Marshall, and yeah, there's one down the street. First right.\" Marshall lit a cigar and puffed slowly before turning to leave.\n\nBefore he could, the tinker piped up. \"Oh, ummm, I'm Sergio and this is Lim Lee. He's from Yushan. Has the military occupation reached uhhh...\"\n\n\"Epsilos.\"\n\n\"..Right, Epsilos. Has the occupation reached here yet?\"\n\nMarshall glanced over his shoulder at the duo. \"You guys are too late, I'm afraid. Marshall law, hehe, was enacted yesterday morning. Only merchant and military ships are allowed in and out of the city.\" He gestured with a finger for them to follow, and they walked down the street, passing decrepit shops, taverns and restaurants. \"The bank's probably your best bet here, unless you wanna risk getting your throat cut for a better deal in the Derelicts.\"\n\nAfter they made the exchange and set up accounts, happy knowing they didn't have to worry about losing what little possessions they had, they set out to find work. After all, if they were trapped in this city, they might as well make the best of it.\n\nThe sign out front said \"Tarley's Tank and Tripwire\". Inside a small, grey-haired man with no eyebrows and a singed mustache greeted them. \"Be there in a minute. I'll be damned if another one of these bastards blows up in my face again. Now where the hell are my goggles?\" They followed the sound of Tarley as he rumbled and swore his way through the back rooms of his shop. He emerged with a pair of sweaty, thick goggle held in an upright fist and a grin on his face.\n\nSergio raised an eyebrow and bit back a smirk before speaking. \"I was wondering if I could use your shop to do a bit of crafting. I can pay, or work for you.\" Sergio questioned apprehensively, \"It's only for the short term. Work is hard to find in a new city!\"\n\n\"That it is!\" Tarley nodded, \"And more so with these damn laws and that horse cock, Torik in office.\" He scratched his chin. \"Tell you what, I'll let you use my shop if you can get me 3 batteries, 30 feet of copper pipe and some size 30d cogs. Prove to me you at least know what they are, and bring them to me and I'll let you use the shop for a couple notes a week plus the cost of materials.\"\nHe shooed Sergio out the door with his hands. \"Off with you now.\"\n\nOnce he was out of earshot, Sergio sighed. This was a waste of time. *At least it's a means to an end* he thought silently.\n\nLim Lee, Marshall and Sergio met at a tavern called \"Harris and Ford\", a slimier place with watered down ale and dried up food. The barkeep pointed at Marshall, \"Oh no, you can't stay the night here! Not again after what you did last time, you little shit! Your friends yeah, but *you* out!\" The barkeep was fierce.\n\n\"Come on, this is just a misunderstanding! How was I supposed to know she was married? She wasn't wearing any ring!\" Marshall looked at him pleadingly.\n\n\"Out!\"\n\nLim Lee looked back and forth, his face screwed in a mixture of confusion, disgust and curiosity. Sergio, made up his mind quickly though. \"Alright, we'll take two rooms for the night, sir.\"\n\nOnce upstairs, Sergio sat on the bed for a moment before walking over to the window. He opened it wide, looking down into the sweeping vista of the alley below, where Marshall looked up expectantly. \"Is this going to be a trend, Marshall?\"\n\n\"No. One second.\" He stepped up onto a barrel and reached up for the window sill but slipped on the damp wood. There was a loud crash and Marshall scrambled to his feet as the barkeep came running out to investigate.\n\n\"Marshall, you little shit. That better not be you!\" Marshall darted around the back of the building and dove into the dumpster, closing the lid before he was spotted. He spent the night there, not wanting to risk a barkeep's wrath.\n\nI now skip over the long tedious quest for spare parts and useless batteries. Through various pawn shop owners and underground thugs, they found the location of a black market outlet. A sweeping underground shopping center where one could get anything and anyone for a price.\n\nThey had to leave their weapons at the door, a couple crossbows, Lim Lee's foreign sword, and handfuls of daggers and knives hidden in boots and coat pockets.\n\nUshered into a room blocked off with a velvet, red curtain, the trio stepped into a dimly lit room. Two beautiful women danced topless on a stage as a richly dressed man lounged on a couch covered in throw pillows and blankets. He waved them over and after briefly looking them up and down with a finger tapping on his chin thoughtfully, he spoke \"Sooo... you're looking for work of a more nefarious nature? Can't say I blame you. Work is hard to find for most people and there will always be a market for people that want other people dead.\" He smiled slightly. \"As it is though, you'll be working for the benefit of the market itself, so no need for you to be making so many enemies all at once.\"\n\nHe held out three pieces of folded paper and added, \"You can purchase whatever you'll need here. If you already have your money in the bank, we can send a runner to acquire the funds, though that increases the transaction time considerably...\" He waved them away and the guards at th curtains ushered them back through into the market.\n\nLooking over the three bounties, they decided to go after a target named Maurice who owned serval warehouses in the west docks. He was large, dark-skinned, heavily armoured and had several thugs with him. He was also responsible for another rising business that the black market wanted dealt with. They didn't like any sort of competition it seemed.\n\nThey purchased several things from the market, and Marshall fashioned several grenades made with a knockout gas. Numbers weren't on their side, so they needed to do this right the first time. They needed intel.\n\nSoon they found the area he was said to frequent, and soon spotted a group of men in armour, led by a large man matching his description. His retinue glanced around the street before they turned into a back alley.\n\nFrom the benches and places they were watching, they set into action quickly. Lim Lee climbed to the top of the building nearest to the alley and hooping from roof to roof, he kept them in sight. He relayed their direction to Sergio and Marshall on the ground and together, they stalked the targets unnoticed.\n\nThrough the winding alleyways, they eventually came to the back of a small house set in between two stores. It was only one floor, but it had an attic with a small latched window. They formulated a plan of entry and figured they needed to know more about what they were dealing with.\n\nMarshall went around to the front while Lim Lee sneaked across the roof to the attic latch. Sergio pulled a long tube off his back resembling the sort of tube an architect would hold blueprints in.\n\nMarshall knocked on the front door and listened as excited voices hushed as a marge man peeked around from a chained door. \"What do you want? We're not buying anything.\" Through the crack, Marshal could see several people huddled around a table dressed in armour. He counted at least 5.\n\n\"My mistake, sorry. \" Marshall looked abashed as the door closed. He held up an open hand with his fingers spread. From the roof Lim Lee relayed the information to Sergio before unlatching the attic and sneaking in. He crouched low next to a drop down ladder.\n\n*3...2...1...*\n\nAn explosion blew off the back door.",

        "text": "Hey there /r/gametales,\n\nSo my previous [Grog story](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1x298e/pathfinder_grog_the_barbarian_a_wizard_and_big/) was enjoyed, and someone asked me if he did any other great things. He was a fantastic character, and I've been thinking back through the years to see if I can remember any particularly funny moments. I had one come to me from a different game that happened to revitalize the Half-Ogre we all knew and loved.\n\nThis world happened to be based on the \"Prisoner of the Horned Helmet\" books. The basic idea was that a barbarian named Baal found a helmet that belonged to a god. It filled the wearer with incredible rage and power, making him nearly invincible. However, the helmet was cursed. As time went on, the helmet would begin to burn on the inside, slowly getting hotter until it filled the wearer with searing agony. At the same time, its weight would also slowly increase. It got heavier and heavier until, finally and painfully, it tore the head of the wearer right off his shoulders. Only someone \"pure of heart\" could remove it. Needless to say, our little ragtag group wasn't pure for shit. xD The next paragraph is a little background on the world, so for the adventure go ahead and skip ahead.\n\nNow, in the world we were playing, steel was a new technology that was just being discovered, and therefore was extremely valuable. Each of us were members of several barbarian tribes that lived on a great plateau. I forget why, exactly, the area was valuable, but it was. I believe it held some very strong iron ore deposits (in fact, most of our starting equipment was cast iron). We were mostly warriors, though later my character would become a shaman. As a disastrous result from the story I'm about to tell, as a matter of fact. A neighboring warlord to our lands had discovered steel, and we were among the first to encounter his troops at a bridge.\n\nOur first run in was brutal. The enemy soldiers were clad in full steel, and well equipped. They also induced a trance-like state to shake off pain by inhaling a powerful set of smelling salts. Clad in cast iron, we were weaker by far, and our equipment was trashed in the fight against the squad. Somehow, after a nasty fight, we managed to kill the squad, though, and claimed their equipment. Seeing the danger that would without a doubt follow, we made a risky decision: We took it on ourselves to destroy the bridge to the plateau. It would slow down what we were sure was an army gathering on our borders. We then reported back to our villages. A council was held at the news. They had heard about the metal clad invaders led by a powerful warlord, but had hoped he would simply pass us by. No such luck. Our current armies would be no match against such a force without the secret of steel. The council decided that wouldn't be enough, though. We needed something more. An elder told us the story of a great horned helmet, crafted by a god of war from the shadows and hatred of his enemies and worn only by his champion. We would bring this back, and deliver it to our own warlord. With this power, we would have an army that may stand the might of the invasion.\n\nSo, away our little party went. First we rescued a blacksmith from the enemy warlord's camp and returned him to our village. In payment, we had him teach our people how to make steel. Finally, we get to the good part, and the part of the adventure where Grog gets to shine. We tracked down the horned helmet to a race of creatures that resembled more humanoid versions of Kuo-Toa and dwelled on the surface (rather than the Underdark). They held an island, and it was said that these \"shark people\" had found a helmet and were using it to brutally test for a way to determine their god's champion before they made a move to kill off a bunch of humans on the shores and move in. We obviously made a b-line for said island. We encountered a couple of patrols on the mainland, which we assumed were raiding parties, but soon found were actually from a village that the creatures  had built on the mainland not far from their island home.\n\nWith some work, we managed to sneak our way by and avoid the majority of the shark-men. Eventually we even commandeered a boat and set sail to reach the island. We had a couple of sea battles, but that was expected. We left no survivors to maintain our advantage. We arrived at their island and discovered a fortress built in its cliffs. Stealthily working their way inside, our more roguish group found an interesting spectacle. The Shark-men did indeed have the helmet we were seeking. In fact, they were using it as a main event in a kind of arena. One would don the helmet, and he would suddenly triple in size, his eyes blazing with a raging fury. One by one, challengers would step inside and be butchered. The helmet granted the wearer magnificent speed and strength, but the effects of the curse were evident. The wearer would continue until either he was slain by a challenger, or his head was torn off as he screamed and clawed at the helmet. Then the challenger would pick it up and the process would continue. The rogues pulled off one of the ballsiest moves we'd ever seen and quietly leaped into the arena, backstabbed the current wearer, decapitated him, and took the helmet, head and all, and made a run for it. It was close, but with some amazing acrobatics and some cover on their way out from the rest of the group, they made it back to the boat.\n\nAs we escaped by sea, hounded by the shark-men, it looked like we might actually succeed without too much of hitch in our daring flight. Then we heard it, a vibration that shuddered through the water with such force that we felt it through the planks of a ship. Like a great gong underwater. It was silent for a moment and the shark-men backed off. Then the resounding note sounded again. We were half way to shore when we found out what was happening. Tentacles erupted from the water and lashed across the deck, the kraken beast heeding the call of its shark men masters. We were not ready for this, and definitely not high enough level. We did our best to simply try to hold off until we could reach shore and escape, but it was becoming more and more evident that wasn't going to happen. Grog and my character were fighting back to back, me wielding a steel longsword and bladed shield I had looted from a corpse, and he swinging his warhammer \"Thumper\" and a greatsword he carried in case of emergencies. When one of our warrior members had his spine shattered in the grip of a massive tentacle, Grog made the big decision. He put on the helmet.\n\nNow, Grog was about 7 foot to begin with due to his half-ogre blood, and with the helmet on he suddenly surged to twice that height. He bellowed in fury at the loss of his friend and began furiously hacking at anything in sight, severing several tentacles and for the first time giving the kraken pause in its onslaught. With that, we sped towards shore as fast as the wind could take us. But our pursuer hadn't given up just yet. We were nearly to the docks when a great tentacle lashed out from behind the ship and plucked our rogue right off the deck. Before anyone could react, Grog roared and lept right off the back of the ship with his greatsword and warhammer in hands and, fully armored, plunged into the water. We don't know exactly what happened down there (it was kept from us from the DM), but a short time later our group was shocked to see the rogue break the surface and swim furiously towards the docks. Blood and chunks of meat began to float up around him.\n\nWe hauled the rogue out of the water and took off at a run, trying to get him steady. We were forced to stop until he was solid enough to move on his own, though. He coughed and spat up water. When we asked him \"What happened to Grog?\", his eyes went wide and he glanced back at the water, \"He's coming!\" he said, both fear and certainty coming from his voice.\n\nGrog was, indeed, coming. The barbarian tore out of the water, bleeding and bruised, but alive and still wearing the helmet. At first we were overjoyed to see he had miraculously survived through the magic of the helmet. Then we saw something else. He was STILL raging... and he was coming right at us. Now, I wouldn't say we're cowards normally, but I have never seen my group so unanimously and without even any actual words, look at each other and each come to the same understanding in an instant. \"Every man for himself.\" We scattered. \n\nGrog came running and began swinging his warhammer and greatsword in great, blindingly fast arcs and figure eights. Anything in his path was smashed, chopped, and otherwise obliterated. Trees reduced to toothpicks, rocks smashed to gravel. The group just got the hell out of the way. Fortunately, whatever roll Grog needed to make to keep himself from outright butchering us, he had apparently managed to succeed at. Once he went through the center of the group (luckily not hitting anyone. None of us wanted to know what his damage was like right now), he simply... kept going. Didn't slow down, didn't look back. He just left a great jagged path of destruction in his wake. Well, we still needed the helmet, so we followed after.\n\nNow, remember that shark-man village on the mainland that was talked about earlier? Well, apparently that's the first place Grog hit. As the party followed the path, we realized with dread that it was going to lead straight through it, and with chagrin we got ready for the inevitable angry mob of shark teeth and pointy tridents that no doubt awaited us. And indeed, we were right. We came to the village, and we could see that effects. Body parts of those unfortunate enough to get in the way were strewn about, and no less than fifteen corpses lay on the ground, none of them Grog's. Even a few homes had been in the way, and Grog hadn't bothered to go around them. Wouldn't you know it, just as we arrived, twenty terrified and angry shark-men started peeking outside of their homes from all sides. Hate filled their eyes at the sight of us, and we knew they were already blaming us for the carnage. Tridents gleamed as they stepped out into the open to exact some revenge.\n\nLooking around, surrounded, beaten and in bad shape from the fight with the Kraken, that familiar \"Well, we're fucked...\" feeling began to come over us. As the tridents were leveled at our party, a beautiful moment of inspiration suddenly struck me. The group jumped as I suddenly screamed bloody murder right next to several of them, both in character and out. They just stared at me for a moment while I let absolute horror come across my face. I pointed at the DM and shouted at the top of my lungs... \"DEAR GOD, HE'S COMING BACK THIS WAY!\" Laughter exploded around the table. Best of all, the bluff worked. The shark-men, understanding common, suddenly dropped their tridents, screamed in horror, and fled in every direction, leaving our nervous little group standing in the middle of a ghost town in a matter of seconds. To this day, we owe Grog a full set of characters, all because he was so goddamn scary that it made 20 enemies crap themselves at once at the mere mention of him. xD\n\nNow, to wrap up, we did find Grog after one more rather brutal encounter involving a shaman that showed my character the entire void, which turned me into a shaman as it drove me more than a little nuts. He actually managed to survive the helmet until we could get it removed and we returned it to our warlord and mustered our own army, each serving as captains and commanders. It was a pretty fun game. :)\n\nTL;DR - Grog the Half-Ogre Barbarian puts on a cursed helmet and goes on a rampage with a kill count including, but not limited to: A kraken, about 30 Kuo-Toa like creatures, rocks, trees, one snake giant, and a village. Not the residents. The buildings themselves. And anyone who happened to be in the way. Upon arriving at said village, the party is surrounded by 20 warriors and is severely outmatched, and in a moment of brilliance one member screams \"DEAR GOD, HE'S COMING BACK THIS WAY!\", causing fear, panic, and allowing for a safe escape from dire circumstances. :D ",

And the gunfighters would put a few rounds in his chest. Not very honorerable but eh.

I can keep us in here with enough air and water for a few hours. We want him REALLY dead right?\"\n\nAnd so with repeated castings of purify air, reloading of muskets, and continual fire that filled the air between them and the target (avoiding the sword fighters) they stayed in the Time Stop for close to 3 hours.\n\nReal time returns and **KABOOOM!** Everyone has to make dexterity checks. The sword fighters are deafened (to be healed with magic later) and KOed from the bow shock. The wizard and gunners pick themselves up blinking and choking on musket powder. \n\nThe target is...a fine red mist. The wall behind him is a splintery mess that extends for a half a mile or more. And then...the cut off head drops to the ground perfectl with a plot and the MOST SHOCKED EXPRESSION!\n\nQue the gunners picking up the fighters and the group escaping unde the cover of invisability.\n\nYep...he's dead.",

        "text": "Mages with Guns. Mages with Guns. What more can I say?\n\nSo back in the day (tm). I was running a home brew setting full of high magic set in a society sitting just at the cusp of revolutionary war gun technology. I thought it would be a good difference to have a fantasy setting with realistic gun, ruins, advanced magic, and stranger thing. \n\nThe core concept was a powerful series of magic guides and the patron nations that supported them vs an upstart nation who went against the guilds rules and were developing technology faster. Basically pre-WWI era backstabing.\n\nWell, everyone in the group took a little magic (as people were in high magic settings.) But I didn't pay it much mind since the group also has master sword fighters, dungeon/history experts, etc. It just didn't seem to be that big of a deal.\n\nWell, as a 'reward' the group found a powerful mana generator in a dungeon after one adventure. Nothing they could transport, but if they camped out they could cook up a few magic items to enhance themselves. \n\nOH MY STARS AND GARTERS!\n\nThe group came up up with Cornicopia guns with endless ammo pounches strapped to them. Lightly enchanted bullets that seeked out targets. And all sorts of minor defensive enchantments. That wasn't a big deal right? Wrong, I didn't pay attention to what they really built.\n\nAs the game went on and the foes started using military weapons against them the group pulled out al the stops.\n\nOne mage, lets call him \"Captain Air Biscuit\" due to a combo of spells he had mastered. (Body of Air, Invisability, Shape Air). Since he could cast and keep all 3 up it worked like near perfect recon.\n\nThis fella had enchanted 3 of his guns with Air Golem spells. Once a day he would load each of the guns and pack them to go out. Trick with Air Golem is you can prime an enchanted item to repeat the action you program it to do once a day. Guess what the gun did when he fired them? Yep. The Musket Carosel would start. BLAM...he tosses a gun. It floats around reloading. BLAM...tosses another gun. By the time he fired the thrid gun the first one was back and reloaded into his hands. He could do something un thought of in a black powder game. Fire every round of combat!\n\nAnother member hd a power stone enchanted specificaly to lean more energy to himself. And he built this into a wand. Not only did his 'rapid recharge' wand allow him to teleport around the battle field like Night Crawler, he would recharge his and his wand's energy at nearly 3 times speed.\n\nOther nightmarish things like enchanted shaped charges! that would seek out and give explosive 'huggies' to some they targeted it with. Self repairing armor and clothing. Heavily armoed shields that were near weightless and could resist al but canon fire.\n\nOh and EVERONE had muskets. Everyone. That's how they started calling themselves the Smoke Stack Brigade.\n\nMages with Gun man. Mages with Guns.",

A little poetry, or sometimes humor. Maybe both.\n\nThis happened with Oblivion, too. Oh, the stories I have about Oblivion. I was mainly an assassin-archetype; bows and daggers were the order of the day. Some thirty to forty hours in, I figured out how soul gems work and how to do enchanting, and I made a pretty reasonable bow that did some fairly hefty damage. I spent a while coming up with an appropriate name, something concise and yet multilayered: Hew--a pun on bows commonly being made of yew, and the idea that it would do that level of damage to my enemies. I was pleased.\n\nInevitably I turned my attention to daggers. Similar enchantments (since they worked so well on Hew), very good killing power so long as I kept it quick. I was feeling a little sillier at the time, and my go-to imagery for this was the stab-and-twist idea. Thus did my primary melee weapon come to be called the Key To Your Heart. (I found that I couldn't keep the damn thing charged as long as I wanted to, so I later made another with similar specs, and called it the Key To Your Liver.)\n\nThis little addition makes a lot of things more gratifying in quite a few games. What names have you come up with in your gaming career that you have particularly enjoyed?\n\n(By the way, I found out much later that Hew was only a middle-class bow with a mediocre soul gem, so I recreated it with better equipment and a smarter ability loadout, but it was essentially the same tool for the same job--a successor, if you will. The new one's name? Well, could it really have been anything but Hewtwo?)",

The idea I had was a powerful cult was slowly infiltrating the country and nobels had formed a group of geaes marked skilled prisoners as expendable agents against the cult. (To prevent the cult targeting them.)\n\nAnd the group...was intersting. We had a male Witch \"Doctor\" who had a crazy desire to cook up dozen and dozen of disguises. He was doing crazy experiments with alchemy in his (later) lab. Testing reactions of monters parts to various things that would kill them.\n\nA half-orc Cavalier who wanted to be a titled/landed nobel. Race be damned. (He had a thing for hitting on NPC villian ladies.)\n\nA drunken monk who's charisma was SO low he was at a persistant -2 on all rollls. This was dubbed his \"Intimablufamacy\" roll. And he kept successing. Also, he acted and thought he was Batman (or the fantasy variant.)\n\nThe rest of the cast at various times included a Gnomish Librarian \"warrior\". A storm sorcerer trying to rebuild his family's shipping business. And well you get the picture.\n\nSome of the colorful NPCs they got to deal with included:\n\nA firery hot red-head Druidess who belong to a sect that wanted to change humanity into weres and other creatures to force them back to nature. (And the Cavalier was kinda dating/not dating her...while she worked for the badguys.)\n\nA Hag who was a bonded guardian of a powerful glade who offered them help to drive off the were's invading her domain. And...she and the Monk spawned a child as part of the deal. (new blood in her coven, and he was so drunk it didn't bother him.)\n\nVookie, a halfling 'merchant' (thief) who they picked up by accident became the team pet and contantly would do minor favors and give them new 'resouces' (stolen items) to aid  them in their quest. He didn't care. He got money out of it. Whenever Vookie showed up the whole group called out to him like Norm at Cheers.\n\nA Lolli Looking (cursed) Pirate Captain's Daughter and her silent but deadly two cutlass wielding man servant.

One of the disguses the group picked up. The Doctor motived the whole group to do it. They took out one of the were group patrols called \"Serpent Squad\".

        "text": "Hey there /r/Gametales,\n\nI have a fun little story for the adventurers of today. It's a bit older, but one that I remember quite fondly.\n\nNow, one of our players (who I've mentioned in several other posts) is the kind of guy who just loves his angry fighters. He also enjoys a bit of humor in his gameplay, using his ungodly amount of luck to win out in fights with rolls that are just absolutely ridiculous. The next paragraph just holds a bit of info about the character, so you can feel free to skip it for the story itself.\n\nNow, in this particular adventure, our player has picked up another reincarnation of one of his favorite and most memorable characters who needs a little explaining: Grog, the half ogre barbarian. There are three things that you need to know about Grog. First, he is incredibly stupid. Second, he loves his well known (and also constantly reincarnated) great maul, Thumper, which resembles a tree trunk with a cinder block strapped to it. Third, Grog hates magic with an absolute passion, describing it as \"Issa scary bad stuffs. Can't eat it.\" In fact, every single time he gets a magical piece of equipment, the group has to convince the half-ogre that it's just coincidence that it seems to work so well and keep the magic at least explainable. The first time they handed him a flaming great axe, they learned the hard way that Grog would immediately scream loudly, wave the axe around because he's too stupid to just let go of the flaming weapon right away, and then hurl it with enough force to not only kill two caravan guards, but also a horse, a mule, and the cart said mule was pulling. That's Grog. From then on, they took careful measures to never give Grog items that were blatently magical, keeping any \"modifications\" they might make to his equipment quiet or explaining it away. Fortunately, Grog generally has an INT score of around 6.\n\nThe group keeps Grog around because of his ungodly amounts of strength, which after buffs, magical enhancements, natural lineage, etc. comes out to around 34+ when raging if I remember right. Grog hits like a goddamn freight train.\n\nOne day, the group had tracked down a nasty big baddie mage who had been vexing them with evil conspiracies, life threatening minions, and a bunch undead nasties(which annoyed Grog because he couldn't eat them) for several months now. The bastard had even had the gall to steal Grog's warhammer, Thumper, as an arrogant taunt after one particular encounter. Grog had refused up to this point to wield ANY other weapon, and had in fact taken feats such as \"throw anything\", and \"catch off-guard\" and several others to accentuate the fact that the dumb bastard was getting pretty good at smashing heads with whatever was on-hand until he got his hammer back.\n\nAnd the time had come. The wizard had locked himself up tight at the top of a tower in his keep, waiting arrogantly in his throne room for the foolish party to meet their doom in his home. After an exhausting trek through the keep filled with magical traps, death knights (altered anti-paladins), and all manner of painful explosions the group had finally come to a great steel door. This door was the only thing between them and their wizard nemesis, and they were dying to murder the annoying bastard. Unfortunately, they were sure that the wizard was ready, and they needed to figure out how to breach the door safely and effectively reach him through what would undoubtedly be a slew of traps and meat shields. \n\nAs they discussed the possible methods of bursting into the room or any alternatives they might have, the wizard inside scryed them and began to taunt them with magical messages that echoed around them. \"It seems our intrepid heroes have come to liberate their comrades before their ascension into my glorious little cult of undeath! How exhilarating! Tell me, have you returned for more humiliation at my hands?\" The group grimaced at this annoyance and continued planning. \"Oh come now, don't be rude. After all, you're my guests, and it would be a shame if I didn't greet you with every convenience my home has to offer.\" At this point, a well hidden rune above the door frame activated and an arc of chain lightning flashed through the group, singing about half of them, including Grog, who began to scream angrily and immediately flew into an involuntary rage, smashing a nearby statue practically into dust and wasting one of the few precious rounds he had left after the extended battles in the keep. They managed to get him back under control and attempted to go back to forming their plan. This took several minutes while the wizard kept right on talking.\n\n\"What fun!\" the wizard exclaimed in delighted tones as the lightning died down and the smell of singed flesh filled the air, \"It seems those reflexes are not what they used to be. A true pity. You're all looking so exhausted and disheartened after your many tribulations. Do not worry, my compatriots, I'm sure you will be bursting into my humble demesnes any second now to...\" And finally, Grog snapped. Bill (the player) turned to me, said \"Fuck it.\", and rolled his die. Before it even finished rolling he went back into character. With a roar, Grog entered rage and slammed both hands against the solid steel door... with a nat 20. \n\n\"GROG...\" The door frame cracked as his hands punched through the stone. \n\"HATE...\" the metal shrieked as he tore the door out with a wrenching motion. \n\"BIG...\"  the metal screeched again as he, in one swift motion, brought his hands together, twisting the steel into a tube.\n\"WORDS!\" He screamed as he burned his last hero point to rear back and hurl the solid steel door which he had just bent into a tube straight at the wizard, all in a matter of seconds. And of course, again, he rolled a natural 20...\n\nNow, something to remember about Catch Off-Guard... the first attack considers the enemy flat-footed in surprise.\n\nSo, picture that scene for just a second from the point of view of a mage sitting on his throne, peering into his scrying bowl and jeering at the ragtag group of adventurers. He jumped suddenly when the metal and stone of the four inch thick steel door suddenly screeched and exploded outward towards the hall, and with a great shout a large half ogre hurled an object inside. He did exactly what comes natural. He jumped up in shock to defend himself.\n\nThe steel tube sailed over an activation glyph for a box of force and blades, over an activatable pit filled with hissing acid concealed below, past three burning devils, between two hell knights, and straight into the wizard who had just enough time to jump up in surprise at the sudden change in expected events... and put his skull in the path of the sudden application of metal. My big baddie was killed in a single round by a confirmed crit... with an improvised weapon.\n\nThat was the highlight of the night. The rest of the fight was manageable enough without my intended spellcaster raining death on my PCs from a distance. Grog was tearfully reunited with Thumper, and it took ten minutes to dig the tube of steel, bits of chair, and bits of wizard skull out of the wall. Much looting was done. :D\n\nTL;DR - A half ogre barbarian gets fed up with too much taunting from a campaign-long wizard baddie. He grabs the Wizard's 4in thick steel door, bends it into a tube, and throws it as an improvised weapon at the Wizard, who stands up in shock just in time to have it take off his head in a godly crit.",

        "text": "So this happend on my first day of playing DayZ, maybe 5 hours into the game. Surprisingly I haven't met any strangers ingame so far, so I had a pretty decend loadout. My friends helped me out with finding stuff here and there, but it was hard to get together once in a while, cause we were so far away from each other all the time. I just wanted to tell this tiny story from the viewpoint of someone who has never played DayZ and never met another stranger ingame before. :) Sorry if the English is weird sometimes, it's not my first language!\n\n---\n\nAfter several hours of getting to know the world while searching for loot in empty towns, I finally managed to hook up with my friends somewhere along the coast. There were four of us, all coming together in Komarovo, with the goal to find the hospital in Chernogorsk. One of us, Steini, needed a salinebag - badly, and we thought that could be the place to find one. My friends prepared me and told me that Chernogorsk is a big city where we could actually meet living human beings, so we would have to be careful. But so far surviving hasn't been a problem for me and I was happily awaiting first social encounters in this desperate, lonely world.\n\nAs we ran through the forests I realized what I was missing during my time alone in this place - companionship, a group to talk to, someone to roam the towns alongside me. We came closer to the city and the first appartement blocks could be seen above the forests. As we stood there, packed in gear, loaded M4 guns in our hands, gasmasks covering our faces, we suddenly felt so powerful as a group, that we secretly wished to meet some people along the way. Not to terrorize or scare them, but to feel the rush of meeting someone alive in a place full of death.\n\nWe found the hospital and we found the salinebag. Once Steini was healed we sat together, eating beans and having a beer, just genuinely having a good time in this harsh landscape. Refreshed and motivated we wanted to take a look at the city for a while. Finally, something new after all these military bases and small villages we've crossed. We ran through supermarkets, blocks and streets and didn't meet anything but the undead. Until we reached an industrial compound that seemed interesting to us.\n\nWe passed the front gate of the factory and wandered slowly through the yard. That's when I saw it in the blink of an eye. Something rushing into a small warehouse. \n\n\"Guys. Do zombies hide? Like, in houses?\", I nervously asked.\n\n\"Wait, so you saw the guy, too?\" my mate John replied.\n\n\"Fuck!\"\n\nWe stood there out in the open, carefully walking towards the hiding spot. I crouched to the wall and yelled:\n\"We've seen you. There's four of us, but we don't want to cause any trouble. Are you friendly?\"\n\nI could not understand everything he mumbled through the walls, but the word \"friendly\" was in it, so one of us slowly walked towards the door. BOOM. My friend Maik was shot in the back before he even reached the entry. \n\"Where did that come from!? Fuck, fuck, fuck!!\" I yelled. \n\nSteini ordered us to stay calm and to hide, so we could meet again later at the main entrance. But it was too late. Another BOOM and John dropped dead. \"What are you doing!?\" I desperately asked the stranger, still hiding behind the warehouse. Steini was running to the exit, trying to look around for the shooter. Before he could see where the bullets came from, the third one found its way to himself. BOOM. \n\nSo there I was, completely unexperienced, watching the well equipped corpses of my best buddies lying on the ground. I was enraged and sad, but I knew that I would be next. \n\n\"Are you still there?\" a voice from the inside of the warehouse asked.\n\n\"R... right here. I'm not moving, I promise. You just killed ALL of my friends.\"\n\n\"Come to the door, hold your hands up.\"\n\n\"I won't come to the door, but I will stay here, hands up. No weapons.\"\n\nThere they were. Two guys with a single shotgun. The motorbike-helmets on their heads and the fact, that they wore no vests or backpacks, told me they couldn't have been around here for that long. They just tricked a group of four heavily equipped guys into their deaths with a single shotgun. \n\nAnd there I stood, peeing my pants while trying to negotiate. \"Please, let me live. I just wanna take a few belongings of my friends and leave.\"\n\n\"We can not let you do that.\"\n\n\"Please, take what you can get, leave the rest on their bodies and let's just split ways.\"\n\nThey talked to each other and walked around me. I tried to convince them, having nothing but honest survival in my mind. \n\n\"I'll hold my hands up for another two minutes so you can run off. I won't follow you and I won't take down my hands.\"\n\nA pause. \"OK. Hands up. Two minutes, we'll leave.\"\n\nAnd they ran off. I was surrounded by the corpses of my friends, an assault rifle and a pistol in my backpack, both loaded. Unable to do anything but let the killers go. I still held my hands in the air, showing that I'll stick to my words. Of course I thought about getting revenge, but I felt unable to do anything but wait it out, after what just happened. \nThey turned around one last time and looked at me. I knew something was off, when one of them stepped back towards me and took a look at Johns body. \"Guys, what ar...\" BOOM.\n\n---\n\nSo that was my first encounter with players in DayZ. Gotta admit, not the most thrilling story, but it made me feel ways a videogame never made me feel before. Real dissappointment, real anger, real excitement. We laughed it off and decided to be a bit more careful the next times.",

        "text": "(Copied from a thread on r/dnd)\n\nI've been playing in the same campaign with a group of close friends for about 7 months now. Maybe a month or so ago I tried my hand at DMing to give our regular DM a chance to play. Since it was my first time I ever I didn't want to do a ton of improvising so I just had them run through a dungeon I had designed in the world that my DM had constructed. I had them all roll out level 7 characters and told them they were to retrieve three special artifacts to help a starving nearby village.\n\nMe and my DM had a bet going where we would reward me with XP if I could figure out what the \"derkin\" where, a small race of hairy black monsters that seemed to be in the service of our BBEG Tharizdun. After scouring the internet for weeks I finally figured it out. They were Kinder that had been warped body and mind by Tharizdun until they didn't resemble them in appearance or personality. I knew I had to bite my tongue and use the dungeon to reveal I had won the bet.\n\nIn a back room of the dungeon, away from the main path and behind two lightning bolt traps was a door with a crude \"S\" carved into it. Inside of the room was a table covered in scrying equipment, a bed-mat, a fireplace, and a hanging cage big enough to hold a small humanoid creature. Inside of the cage was a derkin covered in matted black fur with red eyes and sharp fangs.\n\n\"Hi there. Who are you?\" Said the derkin in a curious almost childlike voice.\n\n\"I run up to the cage and growl at the creature\" said B the party's half-Orc barbarian.\n\n\"Everyone make a Listen check...Everyone hears the sounds of strange breathing coming from near the fireplace. It's not so much ragged or labored as much as it's just erratic. Heavy then soft, loud then quite with no real pattern to it\" I said to my players.\n\n\"I swing around and yell for the thing to show itself!\" Says B\n\n\"You don't need to be so rude about it\" says Cleoritz the Enchantress who pops into existence the moment she speaks. \"And I'll ask you not to threaten my pet again\"\n\n\"B make a reflex save\"\n\n\"7\" says B.\n\n\"Shiny\" says the derkin and as the party swivels to look at him they see he is holding the Half-Orc's greatsword, somehow getting it through the bars and into the cage.\n\n\"Give that back!\" Yells B.\n\n\"I'm sorry\" The now wide eyed derkin says to the angry fighter \"You dropped it. I thought you want me to keep it safe for you.\"\n\nAt this point J my DM smacks his head down on the table. He realizes I know exactly what the derkin are.\n\n\"There there my pet, do not be afraid, I won't let the green one hurt you\" says Cleoritz who once revealed by the light of a now burning fire is shown to be a beautiful if somewhat unclean Drow woman. \"It took so much effort to piece that mind of yours back together, I'd hate to see it splattered upon the walls.\"\n\n\"Give it BACK!!\" Shouts B who lunges at the cage, thick meaty hands bending and reaching through the cage bars.\n\n\"Enough.\" Says Cleoritz and B sees the cage and in fact the whole room seem to grow larger. His hands take on an even greener tone and webbing seems to grow between his fingers.\n\n\"Ribbit\" Says B the frog fighter.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Says M our bard finally joining in the conversation. \"I cast Charm Person\"\n\n\"Roll for it...Oh there's no need for the spell deary, we can have a nice chat without such precautions. I am Cleortiz stark, enchantress. Enchanted to meet you if you'll pardon the pun. It's so rare I get to speak to visitors. I usually simply observe from my humble abode\" Cleortiz says to M, indicating her scrying equipment on the table.\n\nAt this point my DM's head shoots off the table where he had rested it. My character in his campaign is a half-drow with the surname Stark. He's figured out the relation. Cleoritz is his mother.\n\n\"Enough foul sorcery! Release my companion from your spell at once!\" Says J my DM who is playing as a Dwarven Paladin\nCleoritz's head snaps to J and her eyes seem to look into his and past them. \"Hush now puppets. There is someone in your head. Someone gambling with you life on the throw of a die. Beware not puppeteer. My son will not learn more of the Chained God from me.\"\n\nAaand J's head is back down on the table. I'll cut the story there but suffice to say they never got much info out of her and were able to navigate the rest of the dungeon successfully. The whole table said I gave them chills, B said his heart was racing, and J said he was on the verge of an existential crisis after a mad enchantress spoke to HIM instead of his character.\n\nTL;DR First time DMing got my actual DM to question existence through some meta gaming.\n\nEdit: formatting.",

Step brother wanted to play a gnome bard and cousin wanted to be a half elf cleric. \r\r\rSerano the Bard and Maximus the Cleric entered the town of Hernand with the mission of picking up a wedding dress for Maximus' fiancé. They walked through the streets of the town towards an inn (it was getting dark) and a man dressed in brown runs past them and turns a corner. Less than a few seconds later a guard runs in the same direction and yells \"Get back here!\"\r\rWhat did my PCs say?\r\r\"Fuck it, I don't want to get stabbed. Let's go to the inn.\"\r\rOk fine, I wasn't gonna railroad them, I could always come up with an encounter after the inn.\r\rThey enter the inn/tavern and its bustling. The Bard decides to order a bottle of fine wine but its too expensive and orders a pitcher of common wine. They both go up to their rented room to finish up the wine and sleep but no. The gnome wants to drink it on the roof of the inn. Ok no problem, I thought it was pretty funny and he rolled a nat 19 on his climb check. So he's on the roof drinking it up and calling out to passerbys.\r\rThe next morning the bard wants to cook breakfast and leaves the inn while the cleric sleeps in. The bard goes to a fish stall and is offered a free fish by a gay man who thinks he is very attractive (+4 cha mod). The homophobic bard attempts to \"punch him in his shit\" and rolls a 7. \r\rAfter the missed hit and the man threatening to call the guards I decided to call it a night.

        "text": "Ms. Holiday's Counseling and Serenity Grove: a tiny urban oasis of calm run by the petite Russian shaman Ms. Holiday, where stressed corpdrones and overstimulated urbanites can go for a bit of peace and relaxation, a massage or a chat with a trained counselor. Its motto (\"Come With Problems, Leave Without Them\"), however, is somewhat more literal than most of its customers suspect. Secretly, Ms. Holiday is headquartering a team of shadowrunners in the back rooms of her facility-- though her preferred term is \"problem solvers.\"\n\nThe team is as follows:\n\n* **Ms. Holiday**: *The Face*. Short, polite, and ever so correct, the calm smile of this apparent Miss Manners hides a mind like clockwork and a will like iron. She organized the team, and she won't hesitate to use it. Her network of contacts and fixers helps keep the group in work, and her shaman magic summons spirits and bends minds to her will.\n\n* **Oghren**. *The Troll*. Tall, relatively well-mannered, and with a working knowledge of philosophy that clashes horribly with his battle scars and mild PTSD, Oghren spent several years working for Aztechnology in the Yucatan with Ferrous the rigger. Seattle was an attempt at a new start for him, serving as Ms. Holiday's muscle.\n\n* **Eamon**: *The Mage*. The son of elvish immigrants from Tir na nOg, Eamon is a postdoc student of thaumaturgy at the University of Seattle. Hilariously, he's actually received a grant from the Dunkelzahn Institute for studying street magic in Seattle. He hasn't quite told them he's doing so by shadowrunning.\n\n* **Ferrous**: *The Rigger*. A socially-inept orc with a distinct prejudice against dwarves, Ferrous is much more content in the virtual driver's seat of the team van, or one of his drones. He doesn't talk to people. Ever.\n\n* **Tessaract**: *The Hacker*. An elf hailing from the California Free State originally, Tessa is a \"playful hacker.\" She maintains the 2076 version of an imageboard, and takes immense pleasure in exploiting any system she can manage. She is also a total hedonist, and Ms. Holiday is often forced to yank the metaphorical reins on her extracurricular sex addiction.\n\n---\n\nMy group is very new to Shadowrun, and fairly new to tabletop gaming. I introduced them to the game in response to their playstyle in Pathfinder. I've been blown away by their ability to surprise me every time.\n\nThe previous session, the team was approached by a supercilious Mr. Johnson who secretly worked for Humanis, the hardcore anti-metahuman policlub. He wanted them to bomb a relatively moderate Humanis facility, giving them access codes and guard patrols-- a real milk run. Of course, his real intention was to ensure they were filmed extensively on the secret cameras, which footage would naturally be released to the press to drum up anti-metahuman sentiment in the lead-up to midterm city and UCAS elections.\n\nHis plan worked beyond any of his wildest dreams. The team knocked out two security guards, bypassed cameras and drones and planted the bomb before LoneStar arrived. As they left, they caught sight of the cameras, and their faces all paled as they realized what it meant.\n\nLo and behold, the footage made it to the media. Humanis was prepared with an orchestrated PR campaign-- politicians, \"analysts,\" and of course metahuman stooges who presented their case in the most offensive way possible. AROs (augmented-reality images) in major thoroughfares showed metahuman terrorists alongside stark Humanis slogans. It was all remarkably effective, and racial tensions spiked.\n\nIn this simmering atmosphere, the group-- now thoroughly aghast at what they had unwittingly done-- was approached by a very large and well-dressed troll, who invited them to speak with his employers. These proved to be five more extremely well-dressed trolls, whom Ferrous correctly deduced to be \"dear God, the troll Mob.\" The troll Mob, after sitting them down in the most intimidating room ever, pulled up footage of the bombing, now labeled a terrorist act. As the group sweated, the leader informed them that they believed the act to have been orchestrated by Humanis. They wished to contract Ms. Holiday's team to hunt down the \"race traitors\" who did it so as to present them to the authorities and calm the situation. Of course, the stunned team struggled to keep a blank face, as this meant hunting down... themselves.\n\nTheir plan seemed reasonable at first. They would find the original Mr. Johnson, whose home address they thought they had, shake him down for information, kill him, and then locate fall guys who roughly matched their physical characteristics before ditching town for a while. A fine plan, aside from the fact that they should have left town in the first place.\n\nMr. Johnson's home, of course, was empty, having been put up for sale two days earlier. Ms. Holiday and Tessa, posing as a nice lesbian couple, went over under the guise of potential buyers. They found that the neighborhood was deeply, deeply racist, in the well-mannered Southern Homeowners' Association way-- almost entirely human, very private, and potential buyers had to be approved by the residents, to keep \"the wrong sort\" out. \"Don't worry, though,\" gushed the receptionist, \"we're a bit low on our elf quota, and it's always nice to have a bit of color, you know?\"\n\nAfter talking to the vodka tonic-swilling HOA receptionist and warping her will with a bit of magic, they soon learned of Johnson's destination: a private compound owned by Humanis (\"such nice people, they do lovely community service\"). It would not be easy to reach him.\n\nBut wait! the team said. This should be simple! The entire session I had been reminding them of the simmering racial tensions which the bombing had brought to the surface. I had intended it to instill a sense of urgency. Instead, they decided that since sneaking into the compound would be just too difficult, they would start a race riot.\n\nSkeptical, I elected to hear how they proposed to do that. Eamon got into contact with some of the most racially left-wing student groups he could find, after hearing they were already planning a protest of Humanis, and simply pushed them into holding it in front of this particular compound. Oghren and Ferrous went into a bar in the most violent and gang-ridden section of the Ork Underground and, with a combination of booze and violent whispers, tipped the already-tense crowd into marching, guns and all, on Humanis.\n\nMeanwhile, Tessa and Ms. Holiday were getting into contact with someone whose contact information they had stolen some time previously: Nabo, the up-and-coming ork rock star who struggled to keep in touch with the disaffected orks and trolls who are his base. Offering him some more key information (mostly lyrics, contacts, and tour schedules they stole from him as well), they told him what they wanted him to do: hold an impromptu concert in front of the Humanis compound, and bring all of his fans, especially the violent ones. A *remarkable* roll by Ms. Holiday blew my socks off, and Nabo's as well. He agreed.\n\nSo, Seattle simmered for a long, hot day as tensions mounted and plans were formed. People called in sick and holed up at home. You could feel it in the air.\n\nWhat happened that night was not something anyone had really planned. A combination of long-time resentment on the part of the denizens of the Underground, radicalism on the part of the small horde of college students, and flat-out violence on the part of the gang members contributed to a crowd that was ready to burst at any moment. As Nabo played music, laden with adolescent rage over the synth channels, an increasingly outnumbered group of LoneStar officers and private security guards barred the compound.\n\nUntil Ms. Holiday, with a well-aimed Influence spell, planted a single thought into the mind of one guard: sheer animal panic. He fired into the crowd and bolted. He was torn apart instantly.\n\nThe reaction was terrifying to behold, as the crowd surged forward. The guards fired, killing dozens, but were overwhelmed. LoneStar's crowd control efforts would surely halt the riot eventually, but it had too much momentum to halt, and the gates broke under the makeshift battering ram.\n\nChaos and looting inside the compound, augmented by several of Tessa's hacker friends performing the 2076 equivalent of a DDOS to paralyze the automated defenses, permitted the team a small window in which to ride a wave of angry troll gangers and rioters all the way to the apartment where their Johnson huddled in a closet. They managed to extract him, breaking his nose in the process.\n\nEmerging from the apartment building, they found that GOD had descended upon the Matrix like... well, angry gods, just as LoneStar reinforcements and even National Guard helicopters called in by the governor arrived. All of the lights in the facility went out, wireless connectivity everywhere within four city blocks vanished, and the bloody scene was lit only by flickering firelight. They ran, joining the rioters as they fled the scene. On the way out, they passed a tableau they hadn't expected: Nabo, dead on the stage, with dozens of news drones hovering around him.\n\nNot stopping to watch, they bolted, barely managing to circumvent the tightening noose of the security barricades and talking their way past a police checkpoint some distance away. The news covered the riots extensively; drones captured footage of *everything*, including the team themselves (though fortunately they wore face-obscuring clothing) and numerous brutalities on both sides of the riots.\n\nBy morning, the riots were suppressed. The death toll reached the triple digits, and the casualty rate even more. Nabo had become a martyr for metahuman rights, and major political figures were issuing statements. The President of the UCAS had issued a declaration of emergency, and the National Guard were ensuring order on the streets. And Ms. Holiday's team were *so screwed*. It was looking like they'd have to ditch the Mob contract and just skip town for a few months.\n\nI was really just hoping they would sneak in the back.",

Eyepatch of Speed, Boots of Leaping &amp; Striding, Ring of Climbing. The party Monk was not to far behind him in the same gearing. I wasn't paying attention to what they were doing until a series of battles came along where they were ready to 'show off'.\n\nBattle 1: A flying Deathcampus Demon hybrid...it's aireal superiority was cauing problems with ranged attacks so the Barbarian in a fit of rage started climbing walls of the tall cavern they were in. (We'll get back to him.)\n\nThe Monk had the Summoner pick him up and toss him at the flying monster to attempt flying bullrushes, and while he missed a few times this 'fast ball special' slowly became SOP for later flying foes.\n\nBack to the Barbarian who used his enhanced climbing speed and 3 rounds to get above his flying foe. He kicks off from the wall and does a Flying Grapple. Yes, the Barbarian beat  a 8 armed monsters in a grapple check and then rode it down to the ground with a wet and horrible THUD! Followed by the party beating down the new un-airborne creature. \n\nI should have feared for my NPC's lives from this. But oh no, it took another running battle for me to notice just how crazy things had become with the group.\n\nBattle 2: The fight begins with two assassins sniping the party in a complex multi tiered roof top location. The Monk and Barbarian trigger their speed/haste combos and start moving. From just jumping and bouncing off of roof to roof I watch them speed up to around 100 yard explosive sprints. The Barbarian is moving so fast he can cover the entire battle field in a turn. Even when the foe starts using dimension door the following round \"HERE's BARBEY\"!\n\nWhat followed was a ninja Benny Hill scene as the PC's chase the snipers from roof top to roof top, expect I guess it looked more like something out of a Matrix movie on crack.\n\nThese days the Monk died only to be replaced by a Sniper who uses magical cover to attack from...but the Barbarian is still at it. Only he now tosses Anchors at people in massive heavy iron area attacks before running them down to death.",

        "text": "First part is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1w5bkw/dd_4e_i_can_tell_this_is_going_to_be_fun_a_group/).\n\nj=wizard\n\nme=drow assassin\n\nr= paladin dragonborne\n\nM=cleric\n\nm= swordmage\n\nThe following part is fairly dialogue heavy, and I don't remember things exactly as they happened.\n__________________________________________________________\n\nSo I'm still trying to figure out what their angle is when J chimes in.\n\nJ: \"How long have you folks lived in that house?\"\n\nGroup: \"Nearly 30 years.\"\n\nJ: \"What are your names?\"\n\nGroup: \"Huh...that's weird... We don't remember!\"\n\nAt this time the wizard J decides to see if they're under an enchantment and discovers that they are! infact it has the same vibe as the magic that the cultists used to come into the house from before. She succeeds in breaking it with her 20 arcana/int.\n\nthe group of villagers seems a bit lost and the two women and one man just walk off leaving us with 1 adult and 1 child.\n\nJ to the adult: \"How did you get here and what was the last thing you remember?\"\n\nMan: \"Well the last thing I remember was lighting a fire and then I head a voice telling me to come to the house, next thing I know, I'm out here talking to you guys\"\n\nJ: \" I see, do you need any help getting back home?\"\n\nMan: \"No i got it\"\n\nJ speaking to the child: \"And whats your name little one?\"\n\nChild: \"Eric\"\n\nJ: \"and what was the last thing you remember?\"\n\nEric: \"I was starting a fire in the fireplace and I heard dorias voice telling me to come to the house.\" Doria was/is the daughter of the missing family. She is also MIA.\n\nR jumps in: \" And how do you know doria little one?\"\n\nEric looks in awe at the 7 foot dragonborn\n\nEric: \" Wow you're HUUUUUUGE! Umm wehn her family first came into town me and her would play together and she is my best friend!\" \n\nR laughs at the child's innocence: \" did you notice anything strange that happened before they disappeared?\"\n\nEric: \" yea i was heading up to their house one day and i saw 4 guys in robes go in. I thought they were there on business and decided to leave them alone\"\n\nWe realize that that decision saved his life that day.\n\nR : \"Is it ok if we take you home little one?\"\n\nEric smiles : \"Only if i get you ride on your shoulders!\"\n\nR laugh's and picks him up and set him on her shoulders. He makes *whoosh*ing noises while leading us to his home.\n\nThe paladin knocks on the door.\n\nWoman inside: \"who is it\" she says in an angry tone.\n\nR: \"we found your son wondering around at night and we brang him home\"\n\nwoman: \"You mean eric? he's in his room!\"\n\nEric: \"Hi mom!\"\n\nShe opens the door and is greeted with the chest of our 7 foot paladin, unable to see his face since he's so god damn tall.\n\nwoman:\" where is he?\"\n\nR leans down and allows eric to hop off.\n\nWoman: \" Get to your damn room\" She turns towards us. \"thanks, would you like to come in?\"\n\nR: \"yes thank you\"\n\nEveryone but myself go in. I keep watch outside.\n\nThe long conversation reveals that the Mother(who's a total bitch) is married to Morde (that man i killed when he ran out the window), she says he's been away on work a whole bunch and says he has some fancy new armor and points to it on the wall. The armor has the same cultist sigil that we found in the MIA familys house.\n\nThey tell her to have a good night and make it back to the house to get some rest. We search every inch of that house for traps or secret doors. everyone but the warforged and myself take a bed. Him and I trance/rest back to back to watch for attacks.\n\nMorning rolls around and i come up with the idea that we should eat breakfast. After setting everything down and ready to eat, the chief comes into the house asking what we've found so far.\n\nWell I don't know about you guys, but we don't trust this guy any further than we can throw him (except the paladin, i think he can throw him further than he trusts him). So we just show him the sigil and watch his face for recognition. he does recognizes it and tells us it belongs to a cult that's been taking people recently.\n\nNow we're all pretty pissed that he didn't think to mention this before, and he didn't think at first there was a connection between the kidnapping cult and the \"dissipated under mysterious circumstances\" family had a connection.\n\nHe leaves to tend his wounded pride while we hatch a plan on using the armor to infiltrate the cults hide out. but worried that the chief will get to it first since the armor was just hanging out in that woman's loving room, and he's probably seen it by now.\n\nSo we grab some of the clean-ish cult clothes, dress up our wizard and she changes into morde to try and grab the armor from home before the chief can.\n\nWe're all hiding around the outside of the house while the changling enters.\n\nwife: What do you want?\n\nJ: I forgot something I need to come and get it?\n\nWife: What is it\n\nJ: The armor\n\nW: Ok go on get it!\n\nJ Goes to reach for it.\n\nWife:Where have you been?\n\nJ: Working why you asking\n\nWife: Because you havnt seen you son in a couple days\n\nJ Goes to take armor\n\nWife: What you’re not going to see your son?\n\nJ: Well my boss is a real prick and I got to hurry up.\n\nWife: Go see your damn son.\n\nJ sighs and then goes into the childs bed room. He’s asleep but J steps on a bear and wakes the kid up.\n\nEric: DADDY!\n\nJ: Hugs the child \"Hey eric how you doing buddy?\"\n\nEric: Im doing good daddy! Oh I kept the thing you asked me to keep safe for you! \n\nHe hands her a dagger with the religious symbol and J notices an evil aura coming for it. The same damn vibe from the pool of blood and the enchantments on the group of people that forgot their names.\n\nJ: Ok buddy I love you but you go back to sleep for a bit ok? Mom will make breakfast in a couple hours for you.\n\nEric: Ok daddy, I love you. And goes back to sleep.\n\nJ leaves the room and looks for the mom but it turns out shes right behind her.\n\nWife: Oh so you’re giving our son weapons now?\n\nJ: You know how it is! He’s got to be the little man of the house while im gone on business.\n\nWife: It’s dangerious! You’re always so careless!\n\nJ: Listen, I know I haven’t been around much lately, and I may mess up sometimes, but I do everything I can for this family. Every day I wake up and work my ass off FOR this family. It’s all I ever think about every day. Its just that this job pays well but I’m away for so long.\n\nWife: You could work here in blackroot! This new job is just another one in a long line of bad decisions! You always make bad decisions!\n\nJ: I didn’t make a bad decision when I chose to marry you.\n\nWe went crazy at that part. And it took us a few to compose ourselves.\n\nWife: She pauses for a bit. \"Are you going to at least stay for breakfast?\"\n\nJ: I’ll have to eat it on the road since I have to leave ASAP.\n\nJ grabs the food and the armor and then hears a knock at the door.\n\nJ: Who is it?\n\nChief: It’s the chief! Open the door.\n\nJ did so. And we're all a little nervous.\n\nChief: Hey how have you been morde?\n\nJ: Good, what are you doing here?\n\nChief: I’ve been checking up on your family while you’re away.\n\nJ begins to get jealous. \n\nJ: Why have you been checking on my family when I’m not here?\n\nCheif: \"Just to make sure they’re ok, you know.\" The chief sees the armor and recognizes the symbol.\n\nChief: Let me see that armor morde.\n\nJ: What this armor? Why.\n\nCheif: Let me see it morde.\n\nJ: Why?\n\nCheif: I’m not going to ask you again morde. Give me the armor.\n\nI notice that J is fumbling on her words, getting frustrated and is running out of options, I fear a violent conflict and so I do the dumbest thing I've ever done before: I run in (without anything that would resemble the shadow of a plan). And the paladin follows right behind. I just knew we needed that armor and soon. And i'll be damned if the chief gets it before ~~me~~ us.\n\nMe: Hey chief hows it going? I’ve been looking everywhere for you!\n\nCheif: He glances at me and back at morde. \"The armor.\"\n\nMe: Chief I got some news about the cultists that you need to know. It’s important that you know it now.\n\nChief: Then tell it to me.\n\nMe: Not in front of some random people. It’s sensitive information.\n\nChief: It’s ok, what you can say to me you can say to my people.\n\nJ: \"yea I don’t mind.\" I give her a glare that could melt metal.\n\nChief: But before the news I need the armor morde.\n\nMy mind: \"fuck it\" \n\nMe: Chief, what do you know about *ahhh* drow? \n\nChief: What? Nothing.\n\nMe: *ahhhh* oh that’s *ahhhh * terrible *aaaachoo* cloud of darkness. (Cloud of darkness makes a close burst 1 of absolute darkness that only I can see through. I imagine it coming from me like ink from an octopus) \n\nI grab J and R and pull them out of the house and run around back. I tell the warforged and cleric to meet us at the house. Then turn to J.\n\nMe: Change back into the old form.\n\nShe does.\n\nMe: Ok now get naked.\n\nShe hits me in the arm.\n\nMe: Look! He’s going to think somethings up if he sees you in the same clothes morde was wearing and we’re not leaving you alone, and hell see you if we try to run up as you are. So do it now!\n\nShe changes and we run back to the house.\n\nI address everyone.\n\nMe: Ok so we’re probably going to have an angry mob on our ass soon. And running will make the situation worse.\n\nPaladin: so what do we do?\n\nMe: I don’t know about the rest of you, but I’m going to finish breakfast.\n\nI sit down and resume eating, but I didn’t get to finish because the door kicks in and the chief walks in with 5 other orcs and we can see a huge crowd of people behind him.\n\nI try to go back to eating but the chief steps on my food.\n\nChief: You don’t have long to explain yourselves so I suggest you start talking...now!\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEnd of part 2.\n\n My hatred for the chief knows no limits. And I just realized something today that may mean the death of our party. Since the DM has expressed interest in doing a TPK and starting fresh.\n\nI swear one thing though. I will live long enough to see the Chief die by my crossbow, if nothing else. Because no one fucks with my breakfast a third time.",

        "text": "Our DM runs a weekly Pathfinder custom campaign setting, and last night we had so many moments of awesomeness we feel like we have to share it. We're all at lvl 18, so the stuff he throws at us can be pretty brutal. Fortunately, we're PC's, and can be brutal to whatever he throws at us.\n\nThe first awesome thing of the night was a great bit of teamwork between our gun wielding Inquisitor and two weapon Fighter. While escorting a bunch of civilians out of a burning city, we got surprise gated to an NE plane we've been to before (part of the campaign setting), and ambushed by fallen angels and a Marilith. After a couple harsh rounds, the inquisitor Banished most of the fallen angels, the witch froze one of them, leaving just the Marilith left. Unfortunately, the demon was attacking a friend of ours, so the fighter maneuvered to flank it with the mechanist and Inquisitor. The fighter takes his full attack and crits on the first hit, allowing the inquisitor to take an AoO with her gun (teamwork feats for the win), which double crits. This isn't enough to kill the demon, but the second crit from the fighter was. Three crits, all bypassing DR, and the DM ruled that we set up the mariliths head such that the inquisitors shot caused it to get decapitated on the fighters sword.\n\nThe play of the night unanimously goes to our Witch, the DM's girlfriend. She chose the hex which lets her freeze enemies (Ice Tomb), and minmaxed her intelligence to get a very scary save DC against it. After killing the marilith, we were returned to the city, where we saw a massive Retriever (custom enemy of the campaign, meant to be invulnerable. We'd been running from it) attacking an airship which happened to have our gunslinger on it. The witch says she hexes it, and after a brief reading of the rules on the hex, no mention for maximum size of the target is found, so the DM rolls the save, expecting it to pass. It rolled just low enough to fail the save. The next 5 minutes were spent with the DM in another room laughing so hard he was crying, and the rest of us laughing and applauding his girlfriend. \n\nGoing to our gunslinger/Holy Gun paladin (influenced heavily by Max Payne) on the Airship, he'd decided to split the party and go man-mode, solo-escorting a young girl. Just before the rest of us got back, the massive retriever had set the airship on fire, causing it to start to crash. He hands off the girl to our Paladin, who had a means of flying, and then stays on the ship until it's about to crash. As it's crashing, he begins to Max Payne style shoot-dodge the massive retriever, which had broken out of its block of ice, and does enough damage to a massive gem on its back to prevent it from firing its death ray again. We then showed up, froze the retriever temporarily, and watched as he then parkour champions off of the airship onto the battlements it was crashing into, critting his acrobatics check and doing ridiculously well on four reflex saves against explosions on the ships. He landed, but was still alive, stabilized, and conscious at -14 because of Diehard. True manliness.\n\nBut our night was not over yet. We began our assault on a Vampire Lords mansion, and are quickly greeted by suicide bombers and demon knights. Our Paladin, who we joke is our \"real life Malefactor\" due to his chronically bad luck, rolls 15-20-19-16-16-20-9 on a smite evil with a keen scimitar, and due to house rules regarding critical confirmations, this totals out to a sextuple critical (on an x2 weapon, so 2^6 or x64 multiplier), for a grand total of 3840 damage with a single blow. \n\nUnfortunately, the Balor commanding the defensive forces (long story as to why demons are working with a Vampire) shows up, and stuns the Inquisitor. The Mechanist charges it, nearly gets decapitated, and begins beating the hell out of it in melee. Our fighter and Paladin quickly join in, but the Inquisitor is still stunned. Meanwhile, our allied NPC gunslinger/General was calling in backup in the form of 10-12th level gunslingers to help us take it down. One guy in our party (the same guy as the gunslinger/holy gun who had proven his manliness earlier), inspired by Starship Troopers, had decided to roll up a ton of mooks at much lower levels than the party, and was in control of one of the gunslingers. He decides to use the Death or Glory feat, and charges the thing, getting neatly decapitated. At this point, the Inquisitor comes to, and is about to warn the party of one critical detail they didn't know about Balors, namely, the Death Throes ability, when the mechanist steps back and uses a magic item to Finger of Death it. And in another fantastic case of our enemies rolling terribly, the Balor botches and is killed. Unfortunately, the explosion from Death Throes killed the Paladin, fighter, and mechanist, a dozen mooks, and left the inquisitor at 1 hp. \n\nAfter a quick bout of ressurection from the Witch and cleric, however, we were again ready to enter the mansion, something our DM affectionately refers to as \"The Tomb of Terrors.\" I can't give any details on what is in this Tomb of Terrors, but having played the Tomb of Horrors, I can say with utmost confidence that I would rather play through the ToH with the most sadistic DM ever than set foot in the ToT ever again. One guy in our group said \"I would rather face the Lady of Pain than deal with that BS trap again.\" We managed to make it through, and fought and killed the Vampire Lord at the end. \n\nAll in all, it was one of our greatest sessions in a while, and we're sitting somewhat worried, somewhat eager to see what else our DM has in store for us.

        "text": "First chance to post something on /r/gametales, and I'm pumped. It just so happened during a casual conversation with a friend at college that he always wanted to play an RPG. I'm a junior now, and have been sitting here for three years wanting to scratch that itch. I almost hugged him. So before I knew it, I was breaking down the rules of Stars Without Number for four players, only one of which I'd played with a few times. I created a one-shot adventure and pre-generated characters so they could get into it. Character were randomly assigned, and we had:\n\n* Rana Hanna, a female Warrior that worked as an enforcer for the KTC, played by Adam T.\n\n* Ya Han, an elderly old Asian woman who was also a psychic, had been working for the KTC for some time, played by Andrew D.\n\n* Petr Volokh, a male mercenary hired by the KTC to work on this case, played by Alex Q.\n\n* Richard Turner, a male technician that worked for the KTC, played by Alex P.\n\nThe story is that the Keawe Trade Combine (KTC), the most powerful trade organization in the sector, has a problem. Their space station *Import 1* went dark 24 hours ago, after the freighter *Ultra-matter Mistress* reported problems with their ships' core. No lifeboats were launched from the station, and the *Ultra-matter Mistress* was the only ship docked (all others were evacuated when the core problems began, no need risking your million dollar ship if the one next to you goes critical!). The PCs were Team 1 of 3, sent to perform a check-up on the station. They would land in Cargo Hold E and move from there, and Team 2 would land in Cargo Hold H to check the *Ultra-matter Mistress*. Team 3 was on stand-by with 'the Bomb' in case things were that dire. The space station was in the range of nine million credits, so Mission Control made it quite clear Team 3 and 'the Bomb' were only to be used if the team was at a risk of a TPK with no hope of survival.\n\nTeam 1 jumped from their shuttle, using vacc suits to cross space and land in Hold E. The whole station was dark, artificial gravity off, air off, and only base emergency lighting. The team leader, Petr, instructed the team to the Command Center, to return power, air circulation, and gravity to the orbital. They floated along the silent corridors, but did not see any sign of bodies. This was a very bustling space station, and there should’ve been a lot of people around at the time of the accident, and none escaped.\n\nThey reached the Command Center and opened the door...only for the flashbang trap to explode into a dazzling display around them. Ya and Petr were unscathed by the blast (they made their saving throw), but Rana and Richard were both blinded for several minutes. As they flailed about in their blindness, Ya attempted to turn on the station’s systems. All she managed was to turn on the lights, the intricate electrical sub-systems to intricate for her knowledge. The group was forced to wait until Rana and Richard could see again, so they called in to report to Mission Control. After several minutes the effects of the flashbang subsided, and Richard was able to power up everything on the station, and they remembered to warn Team 2 before turning on the gravity (how thoughtful!).\n\nRichard tested the air with his biometric scanner, and they deduced that it was clean. Ya and Petr advised against taking off the vacc suits, because there could be something that caused the station’s silence that the scanner isn’t detecting. They used the service tunnels to check the armory. All the weapons of the security detail were still in place, and Richard took the only shotgun ‘just in case’.\n\nPetr suggested that the team check the fire control center. The station has several large weapons for defense and blasting wayward meteors/asteroids. The group stacked up on the door, having learned from last time. Ya used her psionic power of precognition, focusing on the door to find out what might be on the other side. Her vision flashed a corpse lying haphazardly across the floor, no one she knew. Sensing no danger, they entered guns drawn.\n\nThere was indeed a body on the floor, his body splayed about from when he hit the ground when the gravity returned. He was wearing an emergency vacc suit, and the coveralls of a station technician. His name was Chuck, and it looked like he was trying to activate the station’s plasma beam. He was shot multiple times in the chest, the evident cause of death.\n\nRana used her datapad to plug into the security cameras and see what had happened. Evidently Chuck came in, powered up the weapon, turned around and tried to reason with someone, and then jerked back as he was shot. As she watched this replayed numerous times, the rest of the team discovered a strange mold on the ceiling. It was powdery yellow in color, and shaped like icicles trailing from the metal. Common sense dictated not to touch it, and Richard scanned it. While largely inconclusive, it did register that the mold might have hallucinatory qualities. Though there was some joking about ‘zoning out’ for a bit, the mold was left alone. Ya called Mission Control to update them, and requested a personnel file on Chuck.\n\nThey then decided to head to the center of the station, a three-story mall area built around the hydroponic garden that used to supply the station and act as a bit of green scenery. Now all the trees are shriveled and in a petrified state (we had a few minutes conversation on what we thought would happen to trees subject to a hard vacuum, still not sure on that one). As they walked through the ground floor skeletal remains of the once beautiful garden, a large crack echoed around the circular room as Rana went down, the hole in her chest evident the shooter had a high-caliber weapon. While the vacc suit quickly ‘healed’ itself, Rana was badly wounded. As Petr covered the group with his assault rifle, Ya pulled Ranna out of the line of fire, and used her Biopsionics to heal the damage, pulling her from the brink. Petr fired another burst into the third floor of the mall, where he correctly guessed the shooter was from. They all heard the man go down, and cautiously edged up the stairs in case he had friends. The man was dead by the time they reached him, and they searched the body. His body was stitched with bulletholes, but he was wearing a standard jumpsuit many spacers sector-wide wore, though he had a bright green jerkin (like ones they used to give you in gym class to separate teams). Rana took the sniper rifle and the six bullets they got from the corpse. He was not a station employee, so that meant a third party was involved in this mess. As they worked out their next plan, Ya used her precognition to probe a few minutes into the future, hunting for any danger. Her vision included two men dressed exactly as the sniper, armed with semi-auto pistols and searching rooms in a hallway. The team decided to split up (heh heh) and check the second floor, since they bypassed it to reach the sniper.\n\nRana and Richard hung back on the 3rd floor, Rana using the new-found sniper rifle to cover the hallway that Ya thought looked similar to the one in her vision. There was an open door, and Petr and Ya could hear people rummaging through it. A plan was hatched. Ya ran forward and hit the door so that it closed, and fell back with Petr at the edge of the hallway. The two men ran out, one headed towards them and the other further away.\n\nYa grabbed the man and pushed her laser pistol into his temple and demanded he talk. Petr covered the other man and demanded his surrender. Rana, the best in the group at persuasion, shouted across the gap to the two men, urging them that they would indeed shoot them. Rana’s player happened to roll a nat 12 (on 2d6, so the highest success for SWN skill rolls) and the man in Ya’s arms fell apart.\n\nHis name was Bez, and he was a crew member aboard the *Ultra-matter Mistress*. He said that two weeks ago they encountered the *Sighs*, a sort of floating whorehouse in space. They docked and were fully prepared to have a good time, but something was very wrong. Before long, they were *eating* the prostitutes and the UMM (the player nick-name for the *Ultra-matter Mistress*) captain had made some sort of dark pact with the captain of the *Sighs*. He stated that they were shipping some basic industrial parts, some colonial construction supplies, and a small shipment of fine liquor to Keawe, and when they docked the UMM Captain, Alonso, allowed them ‘free reign’ over anyone they could find. But they didn’t find anyone, and then the reactor issue cropped up. For the past 24 hours they’ve been hunting for survivors to feast on.\n\nNow, what happened next was the best moment of the session. All of the player’s accept Ya’s were arguing about the next course of action, because now there’s cannibals and *they* don’t even know where the civilians went dammit! Then Ya shot Bez. Point blank to the temple, guy was a goner, no roll needed. I announced that he was dead and the other three turned to me.\n\n“What?” “Why?”\n\n“Bez is dead!” I announced over and over again as they tried to reason with me. There was no bringing him back with a lazarus patch, his brain was cauterized. Ya’s reasoning was that he was a dirty cannibal, but the party soon started thinking she might be a bit...unhinged. Again, fantastic moment.\n\nAs soon as Bez’s head went pop, the other guy tried to book it. Rana squeezed the trigger on the sniper rifle and the man’s right leg no longer existed. He fumbled to the ground, bleeding out and trying to escape. Ya and Petr caught up with him, and Ya used her biospionics to fuse the stump together and stop the bleeding. The whole time the man was screaming obscenities and threats, which I gleefully role played.\n\nThe rest of the party returned and tried to question the man. He refused to talk to the woman who took out his leg, so Ya shoved her pistol barrel in his mouth and that got him a bit more cooperative. There was side discussion of psych evaluations that need to be done post-mission. Threats followed.\n\nThis man was named Hakota. He filled in a couple holes in Bez’s story. The UMM did indeed rendezvous with the *Sighs*, and things got a bit out of hand. The captain wanted the crew out of the ship and grounded the UMM in Hold H. He said that the mold was not from them, but had started to appear after their arrival.\n\nFeeling merciful, they tied up Hakota and left him next to the corpse of the sniper. Bez’s body was gone because Ya pushed it over the railing, letting it impact on the first floor. They called in to Team 2, who had disabled the reactor, and told them to expect trouble. They planned to link up and hold out as long as they needed to.\n\nThey started along, being careful of any roving patrols of cannibal UMM crew members. Rana still had the security cameras on her datapad, and warmed the team that a group of six armed men were heading their way. They quickly popped through an access hatch and clung to the safety lines on the hull of the station, letting the hunters pass. Once it was safe, they passed through the airlock and got back inside. They were rushing through a T intersection when Petr accidentally tackled a lone cannibal. He was quickly tied up, and was a bit more cooperative than the others. He said that the captain and the chief engineer plotted the reactor malfunction and were hiding something from the crew.\n\n(Continued in comments...)",

        "text": "Let's start with the party:\n\nAllister Kincade (I'll call him Al) is the party leader. He's stalwart in his dedication to snuff out evil, and it happens to be that this campaign revolves around evil being pretty much mostly demons and the like. He was born into an all but extinct order of demon hunters, and his resolve to get the job done is suicidal. Rules wise, he's just another Drow Paladin.\n\nFiel is the party Rouge. He's got daddy issues and is played by someone new to roleplaying, so he tends to metagame a lot. This isn't his story, though, because he also doesn't tend to contribute very often yet.\n\nThe elf druid, Rolan, is played by the closest thing the party has to a Munchkin. He likes to abuse the Druid's ability to transform into animals.\n\nBob Fossil (named after the Mighty Boosh character) is the party's warrior, and exists because Al's player and I liked the idea. He wears magical plate made out of a tree. he lives by the motto: \"I love everybody. \"cept evildoers\"\n\nFinally there's the newest addition to our party: A laser cleric named Sithrak who (as the Player puts it) \"Heals on incident.\" Great fun.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe party has just faced a lengthy battle against about 20 minions and 4 non-minion cultists. It was level appropriate, so it was no stroll in the park, but all in all it's a pretty cool battle scene. Finishing up they find they were too late to stop the summoning of a greater demon in the center of the arena, and the session's bad guy (a cult leader) greets them on their balcony to flaunt his brand new friend who is going to demolish this gigantic city. (Note I said balcony - this is easily 9 stories high) The demon shows it's head behind the bad guy and I get the last thing I expected from Al.\n\nAl: \"How far away is the demon?\"\n\nme: \"About a yard away from the lip of the balcony, I guess, why?\"\n\nAl: \"And where is Hemsworth? (the aforementioned cult leader's name)\n\nme: \"In the center where the bullywug token is...\"\n\nAl pauses to count squares from his character to the lip of their balcony.\n\nAl: \"Alright, I'm going to run and jump onto the demon.\"\n\nI'm stunned at this point-this isn't a new player and he and I have been friends for ages, he very well knows that this demon is far more powerful than he is AND that I will shamelessly punish stupidity with a PC kill, but here he is moving to roll. The roll comes and it's a...1. A big, fat, juicy 1. Now, we have a houserule where with every critical roll, you roll a d10. On a 10, something on the extreme happens. He rolls something that isn't a 10, and I allow him to just barely hit the demon because at this point, I want to hear his plan.\n\nAl: \"I swing for whatever I can hit hard\" and makes a combat roll.\n\nHe hits, and the demon, being gigantic, more or less shrugs it off. Al's turn is now over, and next in initiative is Rolan who continues to surprise me.\n\nR: \"Alright, I'm going to turn into an eagle.\"\n\nme: \"(still curious, they hadn't made any vocal plan...) sure...why? (he knows that I force him to change back from any flying creature on impact with anything that isn't air)\n\nR:\"I fly up and divebomb the demon's eye. Do I make it through?\"\n\nAt this point I see Rolan's plan. He's going to help Al take down the monster by trashing his brain. Rolan also assumes the Demon has a brain. Nobody made any checks, especially not for brain cavities, but inside the campaign world, demons don't get brains. Just a manifestation of the Warp. Very spooky.\n\nme: \"You made it inside, sure, and you cause quite a bit of pain on your way in. But there's no air, and you'll suffocate in a few turns\"\n\nR: \"that's ok, I hit the brain with my bear hands. (he had bear hands because it was a joke that has yet to get old)\n\nit's at this point that I describe to him that demons don't have a brain. So instead, he targets the hole he entered from and rolls pretty well. Their \"plan\" is working, and the plot device just can't remain standing and still be believable. I have him fall, and both Al and Rolan make the rolls necessary to not die on the plummet. When they hit the ground, one last round of rolls out of initiative create a large hole in the demon's head to pull Rolan out a'la Al and the party walks out of the Arena no worse for wear. They saved a city I'd elected to doom, and on the way out, even escaped guardsmen who wanted to jail them because \"somebody's got to pay for the damages...\" by throwing one into another dimension. \n\nOnce again, the score is Players:1, Plot:0.",

        "text": "Some back story first, if you wish to skip it, look for the long line down below.\n\nI normally DM, so when my friend said he used to do it and would like to get back into it I was all for it. We decided to do a premade adventure first to brush out the cobwebs and since time was short for the DM to make up his own. \n\nThe team is as follows:\n\nDrow assassin (original right?) Me.\nWarforged swordmage(AKA blade tornado): M.\nPaladin dragonborn (with a great sense of humor): R.\nPacifist Diva cleric: Mo.\nChangling wizard (she wins the roleplaying award so far for this run.): J.\n\nThis particular party sort of amassed from the Drow bribing the warforged during an assassination attempt and they just kinda stuck together, then met up with the wizard, then the paladin and cleric were part of the same org/church but then left/got kicked out over politics. Then we find ourselves in a tavern. Also I forgot a lot of the details so I'm going to fill some details in.\n__________________________________________________________\n\nOur party orders a round of ale (multiple rounds for the Dragonborn) and a stranger sits at our table and is willing to trade a story for a drink. We order the drink for the stanger.\n\nStranger:”So out to the west there is a place called the shadow marshes, and in these marshes there is a small town. A very prominent family went missing lately from there, and this is just me talking, but I think there to be a reward from the family if they were returned safely.”\n\nWe pester him for information but he seems to be lacking a lot of answers for our questions. Nonetheless we decided to accept this quest and make our way to the shadow marshes. But not before the changeling leans in to the barmaids ear and whispers ‘That hooded gentleman agreed to pay for our drinks here” and with effectively 20 bluff, diplomacy, intimidate, and stealth. The barmaid believed her.\n\n  \nTurns out the shadow marshes are a pain in the ass to walk through, but we make it to the small shithole of a town called \"Black root\" a town entirely composed of humans, orks, and half orks. We immediately get greeted by the towns \"chief\", \n\nChief: “We have no tavern, no inn, no shops, and no blacksmith. We have nothing to offer travelers and we don’t take kindly to strangers here.\n\nPaladin:” Sir you misunderstand out intentions here, we heard there was a family that went missing and we’d like to help find them. That is, unless you’ve already found them.”\n\nChief:” How did you know about that? Yes a family went missing about two weeks ago and we haven’t heard from them since. They live up on the hill there.”\n\nThe chief then heads back to his hut since it’s getting dark and we decide to put in some legwork before heading into the house. Our sword mage walks up to the hut alone to scout out the outside of it. The rest of us split into two groups: myself and the cleric, and paladin with wizard. \n\nThe diva and myself end up talking to an ork villager (whom I almost instantly dislike and wish to kill. I may have a problem...), he tells us that the family that lived/lives on the hill sells weapons and they haven't been seen for a week or two. And the chief would probably know more than him. (That was seriously all we got out of a 20 min conversation since we like to independently check all our facts we receive.). \n\nThe paladin and wizard end up talking to a group of three women and get much of the same info my group did with the exception that they found out the family sold weapons and the father seemed paranoid a week or two before his disappearance.\n\n Our two groups meet up on the way to the chief’s house and knock on the door. We ask him to escort us up to the MIA families hut since none of us trust him and would like to keep an eye on him. He agrees and about half way there:\n\nMe:” Hey listen I’ll catch up I need to use the bathroom.”\n\nChief: ” We’ll wait”\n\nMe: “it’s a number two so I don’t know exactly how long I’ll be”\n\nChief: “we’ll wait” he said with a finality. \n\n I use this time to go through the chiefs’ cabin and only find some books under the bed, one of which had a scratched out title and was hollowed out. I decide to take this book and catch up with the group.\n\nAt the entrance of the cabin we try and pry more information from the chief but it’s not happening. It was more of not asking the “right” questions more than anything else. The chief walks away before we enter and shakes his head as he’s leaving.\n\n\nOpening the door revealed a metaphorical train wreck. Broken tables, couches, plates, ect. The inside of the house was a large living room with 3 doors along the back wall. We decide to check out this room and find an amulet with a strange sigil on it. The cleric recognizes it and tells us it’s from some Dragon cult or something, usually pretty evil people. Satisfied with the living room we try the door on the right and found it bolted shut. I gesture to the paladin and he gladly punches the door into another plane of existence. \n\nWe notice two things right off the back: A dead body in the corner, and a pool of blood on the ground that’s growing with no apparent source. The pool of blood starts to make a trail to our party and I run as far away into the living room as possible, followed by everyone but the warforged since he’s curious or something. \n\nThen 4 beings arise from the pool of blood in such a dramatic fashion that I may try and copy it one day. Turns out that they’re here for a fight and we get to rolling.\n\nLong battle short it was me and the sword mage doing the DPS with the cleric and paladin providing me with a very effective meat shield(s). I have to give props to the cleric, he was one of the best healers I’ve ever had in a party. Anyhoo, the last ork from the blood pool party decides to try and make a break for it, only restrained by the warforged and tied up by myself. Now begins the questioning.\n\nMe: “What’s your name?” While holding a knife to the man’s groin. Intimidate successful.\n\nMorde: “My name is Morde. Oh please don’t kill me”\n\nPaladin: “Do not worry, we won’t kill you. Just tell us what we need to know”\n\nMorde: “ ok, ask your questions”\n\nWhat follows is him being a smart as and me getting closer and closer to murdering him. He says he want’s to exit through the window when he gets released. The paladin sends me outside, fearing for the safty of our prisoner after I put four shrouds on the man (each shroud does 1d6 normally, but my feat deals 1d8, plus he was close to death anyways).\n\n He tells the group (with a bunch of sass) that him and his three friends had killed the father on accident. But the father owed the cult some money for a loan they gave him, the cult kidnapped the daughter and wife as collateral and threaten to use them in a ritual as sacrifices. The cult doesn’t know the father is dead yet, and Morde and his 3 friends we’re preventing people from finding out for fear of the repercussions.  \n\nThe paladin releases the man and sends him through the window. I was ready; he didn’t make it 20 feet before dying to my crossbow and shrouds. To be honest, I did feel a bit better. I had enlisted the help of the warforged familiar (a bear that has a hover of 4 for some reason) to eat Morde but leave his clothes.\n\n\nIt was then that I noticed 4 adults and 1 child walking towards the house, and I run in.\n\nMe: 2 men, 2 women and a child are coming, and I don’t think they should see inside.\n\nPaladin: “why not?”\n\nI motion towards the 3 dead bodys and the walls covered in blood and gore.\n\nPaladin: “ohhhh”\n\nWe decide to head outside and greet the strangers.\n\nMe: “What brings you folks out here at this time of night?”\n\nAdult orc male: “ We’re going to our house”\n\nMe: “And which one is your house?”\n\nAdult orc male: “that one right behind you”\n\nI look at the house belonging to the missing family and back at them, and am thoroughly confused.\n\nEND OF PART 1.

        "text": "So, I have a regular group of four people. Two of these people enjoy doing adventures by themselves, they refer to them as bro-quests. Typically they take the kobold NPC in the group and head out for a short yet action filled quest. \n\nThis one got a little silly. \n\nIt started normally. Everyone left from the session fairly early, except for the two players. It was clearly broquest time. \n\nFor this quest, they ventured into some abandoned dwarven tunnels in search of loots. They were attacked by duregar slave traders, and they were all knocked out. When they awoke, the rogue (who convinced the other people in the group that he was a wizard) claimed to be an accountant and said he would help balance the Duregar's books. \n\nI decided to have some fun. The duregar allowed him to check the books, and he noticed some ways they could profit! Well he also noticed that there were some discrepancies with their stocks and records. So he convinced the duregar to help the three of them stakeout the stock rooms.\n\nWell it turns out Fred from sales and Susan from accounting were skimming off the top! After they were defeated, Larry the duregar let the three broquesters go free. He also gave them some styling ties. \n\nThis is what happens when the same guy who lets his characters eat kobolds DMs.  \n",
