        "text": "I recently went into a debate about the fastest way to stop a car (with a manual gearbox), in an emergency situation. Is simply hitting the brake as fast, as hard as possible, assuming ABS is doing its job, the fastest way to slow down a car? Or will the car slow down faster in combination with rev matching and engine braking?\n\nMy thought is most modern vehicle have efficient brakes and that its braking force will simply override the braking force from engine braking, how does it work mathematically?",
