The sociopaths in control of the planet will merely turn this technology against this.\n\nHere's what I predict will probably happen.\n\nThey will probably create a UBI system for us in the early stages because they know that massive hordes of unemployed people would result in instability.  But the amount of money given would be very basic. Just enough to survive. Further more, they will also probably look for excuses to vastly limit our standard of limit via rationing of energy.\n\nFor the record, I'm not saying enviormental issues aren't real. But I will say that even if there are legimate issues, that doesn't mean those issues cannot be weaponized against us in bad ways. Imagine a system where you only get 2 hours of electricity a day and can only leave your 'zone' infrequently, because otherwise you're 'harming the planet'. This will be used to control you.\n\nBut the ruling class won't have a reason to keep even this system around forever. Once AI makes us utterly useless, they will 'cull' us. It's open for debate how they'll do it. I don't think they will use killer robots like some predict, but they'll find some method.\n\nSo no. I don't think we're going to be living in some Star Trek-esque socialist utopia in the future. If anything, this is the beginning of the end for us.",

I don’t think our current economic system could handle that. Like when a lot of shitty jobs get automated, do you really think our society is going to handle that well? I keep seeing in this thread that “it’s gonna free up room for people to do other things” but what exactly are those “other things?” I think our current capitalistic system is not built effectively for the elimination of many jobs. Which is why it will probably be phased out slowly with something new (like how it was for feudalism, mercantilism, etc). I wish this thread was talking about this aspect more. I think y’all are slacking on this, because it’s hard for people to imagine a society where we’ve advanced past capitalism.]\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "All I see on this sub is an overwhelming majority of people bashing AI and innovation. This sub is hypnotized by politics and people just can’t imagine a society without work, UBI, and other innovated technologies like full dive virtual reality. The caterpillar is turning into the butterfly when we look at human evolution transitioning into machines. The signs are clear as day that innovation is exponentially rising quick for anyone of us to keep up with. It should be a principle to innovate as quick as we can to alleviate suffering for humanity today and the future, AI is the answer to that. AI might as well be an alien race to us, their characteristics are different but have the capabilities to be much more intelligent than any human that has ever lived by order of magnitude higher than the “geniuses” of humankind. So much is going to change and many many people will still be in denial about this until it literally happens, so be it, idc, just stop being so intoxicated with pessimism, just think about the concept logically instead of without feelings. The first immortals are already born, that is a fact unless we prematurely die out before the AI mergence. The “4th industrial revolution” is happening right now. This is the last of us, we knew this time was coming, we just didn’t know how many generations away it is. Everyone demands change and this is how we change society, by making it more automatic. The automation gets so steep quickly that we will need a plan when it even replaces 20% of the workforce. None of our jobs are safe, idk how else to say it nicely, that is the truth. Many of you here do not believe in minduploading but I assure you your mind will be connected to the internet via nanotechnology/brain computer interface.  It’s going to be a life saving thing to do because if you die in this body, you respawn/reincarnate into a data center, for you, you’ll still feel real in the matrix like metaverse. You will get an option to choose your body just like how we shop for cars or stay in the computer for as long as you’d like. Long term wise, there be less and less humans relative to the entire consciousness composition of humans, cyborgs, and full AI. That detroit become human/cyberpunk 2077 isn’t conspiracy, it’s fucking prophecy and there is no way to stop it, there is no good reason to, it’s a part of mother nature. Yes i’m atheist, but I would call the times we are living in as rapture like. The 3D omniverse will change the fabric of society. We will enter multiverses inside our own minds. The video games of the future are lucid dreaming online 3.0. Our nervous system will wirelessly link with a super computer via AR contacts and swarms of nanobots that translate, transfer, and synchronize our consciousness. I am god, you are god, we are god. When you die in your dreams, you “respawn” or “wake up”, when you die in the metaverse, you respawn, when you die in real life “you “reincarnate”, our souls are eternal. You can’t destroy or create matter, only change it. Our consciousness will blue tooth onto a computer, our brains ARE computers. Our alien race is evolving into a different substrate. Be happy, life is a trip! Progress is not linear, it’s exponential. Have hope.",

        "text": "I was thinking about a potential direction that 3 technologies could work together in the future.\n\nIf we can simulate massive, detailed worlds that are almost indistinguishable from reality (a la the Matrix), we could effectively speed up reality, and by extension extend our perceived length of life.\n\nMost video games already do this without us realizing it. Like when driving a car in GTA, you don't have to deal with the knobs and the levers, you just *drive*. Reloading is way faster in shooter games, etc.\n\nBasically we're constantly \"skipping steps\" in games, steps that we usually don't notice in real life because our brains basically black them out (like how when you commute to work you often forget about the drive entirely) due to repetition.\n\nWe could probably scale the skipping up or down easily with some of the generative technologies we're developing (e.g. using Open AI Playground / Chat GPT to shorten or lengthen stories).\n\nWe could pack more meaningful life events into less time, and potentially if machines can also trigger neurochemicals -- also make them *feel* more impactful / longer, such that essentially our entire subjective experience of them is say 2-3 times longer than they actually are.\n\nThis is something that we could prove too -- we've already run plenty of experiments on how people perceive time.\n\nI'm fairly confident that this *must* be possible... I've experienced the sense of \"importance\" and *massive* time dilation on weed and LSD before, it's totally a thing. In particular I remember one time feeling like I'd spent 1-2 hours in about 2 minutes on a high dose of LSD.\n\nSo even if life extension technology takes too long and we can't live forever (I'm fairly certain I will not), we might be able to have a subjective lived experience of 200 - 300 years or something like that.\n\nTime to travel the world and do everything we wanted to do, in a massive world that feels comparably as real as the outside world.\n\nI think the only open questions are how much we can extend the experience by, and how much extending the perceived time will degrade the experience.\n\nHell you could view things like the Skyrim Grandma as a much simpler form of this -- extending her lived experience through a highly immersive game where all distances are deceptively shorter than they feel and all events are deceptively faster than they would be in the real life.\n\nNo idea how long it will take us to get to the best versions of this concept (I think it will depend heavily on development of brain-computer interfaces capable of *sending* information to the brain rather than just *receiving* it), but it makes me hopeful.",

        "text": "In a major breakthrough, CarbonClear Solutions has developed a revolutionary new technology for creating gasoline from air. The process utilizes advanced electrolysis techniques and solar energy to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into a hydrocarbon feedstock, which is then synthesized into gasoline through chemical reactions such as the Fisher-Tropsch process.\n\nAccording to CarbonClear, the process is highly efficient, requiring only minimal energy inputs to produce a high yield of gasoline. As a result, the company has announced that when production is running at scale, the price of a liter of gasoline will cost less than 35 euro cents, making it a highly competitive and cost-effective alternative to traditional fossil fuels.\n\n\"We are confident that our technology can produce gasoline at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods,\" said Dr. Laura Williams, CEO of CarbonClear Solutions. \"We estimate that we will be able to produce over 50 million liters of gasoline per year at our demonstrator facility, with the potential to scale up production as demand increases.\"\n\nBut this groundbreaking technology didn't come without its challenges. When the founders of CarbonClear formed a focus group at MIT to discuss the potential of this technology, they were met with fierce resistance from the fossil fuel industry. Threats were made against the founders and their employees, causing them to keep their work a closely guarded secret for fear of retribution.\n\nNow, after years of research and development, CarbonClear is ready to share their technology with the world. In a bold move, they have announced that they will be open-sourcing it to other companies, as they are only in the business of research and development consultancy. This decision has been met with enthusiasm from the scientific community, who see it as a way to accelerate the global transition to low-carbon and renewable energy sources.\n\n\"We are not in this for the money,\" said Dr. Williams. \"I personally have more than enough to retire comfortably, but I firmly believe that mankind could use a helping hand. That's why we are open-sourcing our technology to the world - we want to make a positive impact and help drive the global transition to low-carbon energy sources.\"\n\nCarbonClear will be presenting their entire package of data, including all the necessary information for building and running production plants, to interested parties by Q2 2023. This will allow companies to start setting up their own facilities and begin producing gasoline from air on a larger scale.\n\nOverall, this new technology is a game-changer in the energy industry, offering a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuels. It is expected to have a significant impact on the global market for gasoline and could potentially revolutionize the way we produce and consume energy.",
