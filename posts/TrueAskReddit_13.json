But I feel like we're at a breaking point where our endless consumerism and need for more and better is having a serious negative impact on our environment. Now just imagine, that all technological progress would come to aa stop - forever (except for progress towards greener planet). \n\nThere'd be no new iPhone models to buy, no new VR coming out. The planes we currently fly and cars we drive would stay the same except for the greener technologies (electric cars). Your PC could only upgrade to the highest point of today and the games would need to use whatever computing capacity we've got available right now, forever.\n\nNo new, better cameras, smaller GoPROs with higher resolution. No dreams of a flying car in the future and no personal robots. \n\nIt's undeniable that our need and want to have more, cheaper and better everything is making us not only more consumeristic, but also draining the planet of all the resources faster (see the \"new iPhone/Mustang/laptop every year mentality). And I feel like we've already had so much that individual can't make a use of it in a single lifetime. There's enough gadgets to try out, instruments to play, crazy adrenaline sports to pursue to keep us engaged.\n\nWould you trade all this to keep the planet healthier? Or would you rather we keep progressing and hopefully find a way to solve the mess we make along the way in the future?",

Or B) smokers can wait till the end of their shift or their lunch break to smoke and not smoke the rest of the time. \n\n\nBonus question: should smoking remain legal or should it be made illegal due to the effects it can have on others through second hand smoke?
